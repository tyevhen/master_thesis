giamatti and curch in sideways today 's post is reblogged with permission from author zone com it took me ten years to finally get around to watching the quirky bromance sideways , starring paul giamatti , thomas hayden church , virginia madsen , and the ever piquant sandra oh while the film does many things well and is , on the whole , watchable , it 's also the kind of highly forgettable flick that will spawn no sitcoms , inspire no remakes , prompt no sequels , but in all likelihood simply linger in cable purgatory for untold aeons , to perplex future millions one of the film 's main characters is not a person but a thing wine stop there 's lesson no are you making at least one thing into a character ? two buddies go on a road trip and try to get laid before one of them has to appear at his wedding that 's the logline already forgettable , right ? but the road trip involves winery hopping , and we get to watch and listen as characters constantly fuss over wines , swirling them , sipping them , describing their sturdiness or their spicy oakiness , or their past their peakness , etc , to the point where you want to reach for a paper bag and puke up something well past its primeness one of the failings of the movie , imho , is that for all the wine talk , it failed to draw parallels between characteristics of wine and themes of the story the opportunities for synergistic symbolisms was dare i say ripe they mostly went dare i say wasted but the script by alexander payne and jim taylor did do a lot of things right , and i suspect rex pickett , in writing the novel on which the film is based , did even more of those things right i'm talking mostly about character development the characters could easily have been cardboard cutouts , stereotypical bachelor buddies , and in some ways they were , of course but below the surface level depictions lurked dark , thwarted dreams , conflicting desires , countervailing motivations , self doubts , under realized virtues , and unexpected flaws as well as unexpected behaviors all of these sorts of things make the characters more believable if not always more sympathetic , and that 's what a reader or a viewer wants real people with real faults , conflicting desires , complex agendas , the capacity for change maybe only in some ways , not in all ways and a capacity for optimism , despite an overlay of gloom in sideways , the giamatti character is a depressed school teacher whose novels keep getting rejected a character with no faults is a caricature no real human being is all good or all bad hitler had a dog , for crying out loud of course , he famously euthanized it in the end just as a wine can have many small flaws and still exude charm , so can and should the characters in your story give all your characters real flaws , along with inner turmoil be sure your villain is not one hundred and ten percent villainous give him or her some endearing qualities , and show him to have inner doubts as well and by the end of the story , force the characters to confront some demons force them to change , or at least consider what they lost by not changing people are complex , in the real world make it so in your story world get free tips in your inbox sign up for the author zone newsletter
