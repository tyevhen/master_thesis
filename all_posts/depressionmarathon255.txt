i hope you all had a very merry christmas i know the holidays can be stressful fortunately , my holidays have so far gone well i just got home from spending christmas with my boyfriend , d we had a very nice time i drove the four hour drive after working the morning of christmas eve , and then we left immediately to spend the evening with his entire , huge family d has eight siblings and a seemingly unending supply of nieces , nephews , grand nieces , and grand nephews it was confusing , controlled chaos , but i had fun christmas morning was spent with d 's son we opened presents and ate their traditional brunch the rest of the day d and i spent together we relaxed , went for a walk with jet , watched a movie , and cooked a nice dinner together it was quiet , and i think we were both quite content with that the rest of the weekend was equally simple and relaxing it 's always hard to leave , but i'm glad to be back in my home environment , nonetheless today is a big day nine years ago today i finally got it i took my last drink , and i 've stayed sober one day at a time ever since nine years it 's really quite amazing nine years ago i was a hopeless case i was selfish , self centered , and discontent i had tried multiple times to stop drinking for good stopping was n't the problem i was actually pretty good at that staying stopped was the problem it was n't until i finally committed myself to the simple tools laid , multiple times , at my feet , and decided to focus on staying sober for hours at a time that i got it i 've grown a lot over the last years being sober has opened my eyes and heart to whole new life , a life i never thought imaginable i never knew how to be an equal in a relationship until i got sober i never knew how to handle anger and resentments until i got sober i never knew the meaning of gratitude and humility until i found sobriety sobriety brought me a relationship with my mother i was previously too immature to handle or appreciate being sober did n't cure my depression , but it certainly made a huge difference in my mental health stability it 's amazing how much better mental health medications work when i'm not washing them down with beer ! sobriety , in a nutshell , gave me a life worth living nine years i 've had hurts and heartaches , joys and celebrations , good times and bad times , depression relapses and remissions , and i 've remained sober through it all it can be done i'm doing it and if i can do it , anyone can do it it 's a beautiful thing i'm so grateful to be sober today
