things are falling into my lap again i got a phone call yesterday , which i followed up on today remember that physical therapy job i interviewed for on christmas eve ? they decided to give it to someone with home health care experience , of which i had none apparently , their new hire is not working out the woman who interviewed me called yesterday to offer on call hours today it changed to permanent , part time hours we 're working out some of the details and plan to connect again tomorrow it appears i may have an unexpected new job in the very near future wow ! as per usual , i'm excited and a little frightened by this surprising development working nearer to home would mean an end to the mile drive to and from work it would mean an end to working in the crowded , basement office of a nursing home with not so nice nursing staff of course , i like my co workers and would feel a little guilty about leaving they 've counted on me when i started just over one year ago , i filled a position that had been open for two years of course , i'm replaceable , and they could fill my position in a week this time you just never know i know i need to do what 's best for me but does one ever know exactly what that is ? there are pros and cons to everything , and the unknown always frightens me my sponsor told me to pray about it i have i will i 'll let you know what happens
