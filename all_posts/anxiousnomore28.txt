i 've had some people asking for an update i know that i am not the best at posting on a regular basis its not that i do n't care , but rather i do n't want to put lame posts up that were created just so i can say i posted i want the quality of posts to be better than the quantity if that makes sense this means when my anxiety is up , usually i have more posts , and when my anxiety is n't really bothering me much , than my post count goes down just more proof that anxiety comes and goes like a roller coaster lately , i have n't been having many issues with my anxiety i think i am in a good place right now with my pregnancy the beginning of the pregnancy did n't help out with my anxiety like i thought it would , but i think by the second trimester eventually my hormones leveled off to a good place i am due in about a month and it will be interesting to see if i continue to do well while nursing or if the anxiety returns some of the best life lessons can be found in simple childrens' stories , songs , and poems so here are a couple fun quotes from the best children authors to help you through the day listen to the must n'ts , child listen to the do n'ts listen to the should n'ts , the impossibles , the wo n'ts listen to the never haves , then listen close to me anything can happen , child anything can be shel silverstein be who you are and say what you feel , because those who mind do n't matter and those who matter do n't mind dr suess hope everyone is doing well ! if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like oh boy or girl ? ! ? worst fears sometimes do come true why do we shut people out when we need them the most ? big news and lots of anxiety to go with it linkwithin
