if you 've been following the last couple of posts , you 'll know that i 've been focusing on meditation in the last post , i explored the safe place meditation where you imagine engaging as many of your senses as you can in a relaxing place of your choice the challenge of visualizing during meditation for many people , visualizing during meditation can be a challenge when they close their eyes and try to visualize , nothing comes and they might feel discouraged if this happens to you , the good news is that you can practice and improve your visualization skills if you 're patient , it usually gets better with practice over time the challenge of visualizing during meditation visualization exercises one way to practice is to take a simple object , like an apple , and use that to practice for instance , if you 're using a red apple , place it in front of you , at eye level , if possible now , notice the color really notice the quality of the red is it a deep rich red or a lighter red ? are there other colors on your apple ? maybe your apple is also partly green notice what kind of green it is now , notice the size and shape of the apple is it short and round in the middle and flat at the top and bottom or is it wider at the top , round in the middle and narrow at the bottom ? is the stem still attached ? are there any bruises on the apple take your time spend a few minutes looking at the apple now , close your eyes , take a couple of deep breaths and picture your apple if nothing comes , open your eyes and focus on the color again practice doing this a few times a lot will depend on how much you can relax you can start by trying to visualize an apple as your power to visualize improves , you can try other objects sea shells , flowers , and whatever other objects you like you can also use photographs of people 's faces the process would be the same focus on the picture , notice the features , and then close your eyes and see the face from the picture you might try visualizing a sea shell as i 've mentioned before , visualizing usually gets better with practice so do n't get discouraged let yourself have fun with this allow your playful side to come out and enjoy visualizing or , you could practice visualizing a flower you might have other sense experiences the other important thing to realize is that you might have other skills , aside from visualizing , that work for you for instance , some people are very good at having a felt sense in their bodies other people can imagine in their mind 's ear hearing music what 's important is not which sense is most dominant for you , but that you have a sense that you can use to help you to relax and meditate i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist please feel free to call me at to set up a consultation also , see my article wellness meditation photo credits photo pin
