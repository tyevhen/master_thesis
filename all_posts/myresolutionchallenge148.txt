nanowrimo which stands for national novel writing month is now in its th year i have dreamt of taking part for the past years but as each november drew closer , i allowed that minx of an inner demon to tell me i could n't possible do that 'pah , who are you kidding , write , words , not a chance ! ' me at my nano desk so on the st november this year , i looked that evil minx straight in the eye and said 'back off sister , you ca n't achieve if you never take part ' once i had signed up and began writing , i very quickly came to the conclusion that i was either uber organised or had absolutely no life whatsoever i am leaning toward the latter ! having never taken part in anything so challenging , i used my time wisely and over the summer months i planned , i plotted , i built character profiles and i even drew little maps of what my 'other' worlds would look like yes , i am that neurotic of course this all paid off and i made a flying start by day , i had logged , words on my nano page take a look at my profile www nanowrimo org participants fantasy writer shelley however , as i sat grinning from ear to ear , thinking i was doing really well , i found another nanoer who had logged , , another who reached , by day and even my regional municipal liaison for birmingham 's nano writer 's group smashed the k mark yesterday these guys are the yoda of the nano challenge and i salute them i have learnt a valuable lesson from these amazing chaps , anything is possible if you just get on and do it so as a virgin nanoer , what other lessons have i learnt from this crazy quest ? you are not alone ! there are , of us taking part this year granted , i have n't managed to say hello to all of them , but i have made some wonderful new friends from all over the world i can do anything i set my mind to i can enjoy writing to a deadline in fact this has been a fantastic way to keep me focused , i even have writing time outlined in red pen in my diary it is possible to ask the question , 'if i stab someone in the heart with a magic sword will they die instantly ? ' and not get arrested i love the forums ! week is notorious for abandoning this challenge , according to the gurus at nano hq , but i have no intention of leaving my characters and running for the hills let me know if you fancy reading an excerpt next week and i will post a bit on my blog for you be warned , i'm writing a ya fantasy novel ! are you taking part this year ? how are you getting on ?
