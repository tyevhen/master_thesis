i am now in recovery from depression , neither cured not expecting to be it is a chronic disease in my case and it would be unrealistic not to expect another occurrence or two in my remaining lifetime when i think back on my life , before my diagnosis i suffered major depressions since i have suffered more the longest was the recent one , two years , provided i remain in remission the deepest one was at age when i was finally ushered into treatment thus through age i suffered five major depressions , and since being diagnosed , through age , while under treatment , i have suffered three more this is not statistically significant in terms of prevention , unfortunately , but who knows how much i would have suffered without treatment ? just as alcoholics are in recovery , think of me as a melancholic in in recovery , though this parallel cannot stand much scrutiny , as the latter is more difficult to treat , in my experience now you may rightly ask what concatenation of fortuitous circumstances led to my current recovery in no particular order spiritual my friend eric had a dream about christ weeping over my body and healing me about two weeks later , before the new antidepressant had had any effect , i wept in prayer while trying to pray as honestly as i possibly could for the first time in i do n't know how long , i felt some brief , inexplicable connection with the light , a momentary piercing of the veil , so it seemed chemical on march my doctor changed my antidepressant again within a week we upped it to therapeutic levels two and a half weeks later , the usual time frame for response to an antidepressant weeks , i began to feel a little better this was on thursday , april , when i was stranded in lost hills , ca , with a cracked radiator being confronted with a minor crisis was a pleasure in my state , as it got me out of myself thanks to a tip about some mechanics who hung around their shop late , we were able to move on the same night fgi for general information a plastic radiator ca n't be fixed with insta weld it must be replaced behavioral and social in visiting my daughters and my oldest friend , though cruelly prevented from seeing my grandson , i had a chance to pretend to be myself , to pour myself into the mold of the upbeat , humorous , philosophizing , friendly , garrulous and sometimes offensive person i usually am my second daughter , keturah , invited me to happy hour the next day , april , and we had an exotic martini drinking jamboree competition at half price i was also able to see sarah perform in a play for only the second time since middle school and i sat for two hours in an old familiar bar , joe jost 's , with eric , talking while trying to avoid any mention of depression i was so sick of talking about it when i returned home i continued to pretend to be myself with dogged courage there were times when melancholy begged admission , but i refused to discuss my depression i lied to kathleen about how i was feeling as a matter of course i even avoided seeing my psychiatrist because in nearing his office i burst into tears at the memory of all the times i had sat in his office depressed i told him by e mail and he understood this wednesday i will likely be well enough to see him socially i should also mention that traveling miles with my stepson , derek , was a tonic he 's funny and upbeat among other things he taught me the difference between hip hop and gangsta rap through a plethora of too loud examples in returning home my volunteer work began to pick up , obligating me to work with others while iavoiding any mention of my condition i am now involved with six different volunteer groups , including a musical gig for a group sing with the homeless and mentally ill every friday to sum up , there was eric 's dream and my later prayer a significant change in medication i went off two meds and on two others and the social behavioral opportunity to be myself , a chance i clung to like a life raft in a flood ! without all three features i do not know if i would have improved , but i consider the change in antidepressants the most important , as without a slight elevation in mood i would not have thought of pretending to be myself antidepressants sometimes make you just well enough to get better with other help and that help comes through doing , not being , as my shrink is fond of saying in my next post i hope to create a plan for preventing relapse meanwhile i 'll re post my most encouraging poem , many readers' favorite tonic i will love myself today here are some fuzzy slippers and a lollipop , a warm hug and a wet kiss let me tuck this old familiar blanket around my shoulders and read this poem before i nap whatever i do today , i ll approve if i spill milk , i ll clap if i button my shirt wrong it s a new style if i wet my pants it was on purpose my , how well i walk ! how well i speak ! it s so good to be good to myself where have i been all these sad , long years ? kiloneutral though ever vigilant , craig erick
