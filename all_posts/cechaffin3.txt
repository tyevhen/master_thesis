my blog has been moribund , for any still following it my depression has been so severe that i have been essentially non functional i can do a few tasks like take out the trash and wash the dishes , but even facing my e mail seems often an insurmountable burden i have a bright intellectual friend , norman ball , whose work i recommend , but right now his writing is too exalted for me to parse , for the most part my mind is near constantly darkened by the obsession of suicide , the only release my brain seems to comprehend or imagine i resist this daily , but it is extremely hard to live when your own brain has become your enemy the voices in my head , like howling dogs , constantly sing an odious hymn of self loathing and self destruction nature abhors a vacuum thus the locusts have come in to roost i do n't know how to break this cycle perhaps it most involves acceptance and doing doing anything , like writing this in focusing on a task , however brief or menial , i do get some temporary relief but the overwhelming majority of the time has me , as my friend ralph described , cowering in my cubicle i feel a coward for not being able to face life life does n't come to me in specific details but as an overwhelming , all devouring wall of impossibilities i quit blogging mainly for fear that i was only going in circles about depression after all , there is only so much to be said about it , and i thought the narrative might be reinforcing the disease then objectification of my suffering in words may have some therapeutic benefit do n't know when i 'll blog again all you out there not afflicted with a serious mental illness , give thanks daily namaste , craig
