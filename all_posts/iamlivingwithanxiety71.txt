when i'm whipped up into an anxious state or angry temper , it is so easy to forget recovery training but of course this is the exact time i need it the most as dr low pointed out , we must spot symptoms at their very onset clearly , the trigger symptom must be spotted before it has an opportunity to generate the panic and the vicious cycle this is possible only if the spot diagnosis is established in the split second when the trigger reaction is born stating it otherwise , it means that the spot diagnosis must acquire a trigger quality this is easier said than done yet i have found that as i practice recovery , i learn to spot more frequently spotting does n't remove the uncomfortable sensations , as we must wait for those to fall on their own but it does help to control my reaction to them , as my thoughts and impulses are within my control reference low aa mental health through will training glencoe , ill willett publishing co
