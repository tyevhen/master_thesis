dr john crippen not his real name over at nhsblog talked yesterday about the proposal for mandatory psychiatric evaluations on all patients admitted for hospice care regarding a cancer patient , he writes of course he is bloody well down he is about to depart from life he is about to leave his wife and children forever he knows this he is not just down he is seriously pissed off dying is an unpleasant business best avoided but , if you have to do it , do not expect it to be fun or a clap happy learning experience he goes on to ask do patients with cancer suffer from severe depression ? of course they do occasionally and when they do , they need help , and support and possibly medication but this is a rare occurrence patients ingrownowing toe nails get depression too , but you are not going to attach a psychiatrist to every chiropody clinic are you ? if this trend continues , we will end up imposing a psychiatrist on every patient with cancer unnecessary , patronising and offensive i was thrilled to think of myself , in my professional capacity , as being attached to chiropody clinics , imposed on patients , and a referral for my services is unnecessary , patronising and offensive great what more could my image want ? one of his commenters talks about his cat 's death and asks facetiously , we were all a bit miserable do we need psychiatric help ? i posted about this topic a while back see help me if you can , where i wrote about my childrens' comments that their classmates go to therapy for a year when their parents get divorced it 's all part of the same line of questioning does one need therapy or medications or any other psychiatric intervention when bad things happen , be it cancer , grief , divorce ? treatment may help those who do become depressed following a stressor half of all patients suffering from an episode of depression will identify a clear precipitant treatment may help those who are reacting in a dysfunctional , unusual , or highly symptomatic way treatment may offer a degree of comfort to distressed people even in the absence of mental illness but does everyone who is exposed to awful circumstances need treatment ? nope some times life is just hard and there 's no escape from suffering it 's hard to know what to say to this grief runs its course , people generally adapt to difficult circumstances , but it 's hard to say do n't get help , when really , some folks find it helps shiny happy person returned this weekend , and she writes one of the most eloquent descriptions of depression , as opposed to simple misery , that i have ever seen utterly miserable is what a lot of people mistake for depression , but they are not the same thing god , i should know depression is both the most godawful , visceral agony , and a numbness so overwhelming you ca n't imagine ever feeling real again it is an inability to feel or be affected by anything other than your own intense pain it is frostbite of the mind it is that dream where you want to scream but no sound comes out depression is the feeling of walking through glue , both physically and mentally , which reflects in the effort it takes to open your mouth to speak depression paints the world monochrome and muffles all sounds depression strips away your personality and leaves you two dimensional normal human functioning diminishes sleep dwindles to nothing , food becomes an alien notion , weight falls from your bones in a physical representation of your character and the person you have forgotten you used to be depression is crawling on hands and knees to get to the bathroom it is lying in bed and wondering if you would be able to move if the house was on fire it is trying to carry out a familiar activity and not having the first clue what to do
