the good news is i'm feeling better , and i'm back home i got out of the hospital friday just before noon and that was as a direct result of the positive reaction i had following my second infusion of ketamine on thursday my mood was much improved after both the second and third , which took place yesterday , ketamine infusions i continue to feel better today unfortunately , with good there is , at least on this occasion , bad news as well i spoke with my back surgeon 's nurse just after returning home friday tomorrow marks weeks since my back surgery , weeks since the original injury i got the clearance to go back to work part time beginning tomorrow during our discussion , however , i informed the nurse my left leg is still weak her reaction was not positive i could tell by the immediate pause and change in voice tone the nurse , my surgeon 's right hand woman , was concerned i continued to have significant leg weakness i listened intently as she informed me of the typical progression of recovery basically , very few patients , in their experience , continue to see improvement after weeks most of the strength gains that will be made are made within the first weeks following surgery i was devastated i tried to maintain my composure after this news , but it was futile i ended up in tears it 's still hard for me to think about , but there is a very real possibility i wo n't be able to run again i know , because i 've tried my leg is too weak i could n't run yesterday i ca n't run today and if my leg strength does not improve beyond where i'm at today , there will be no tomorrow i will not be able to run in the future it 's hard to imagine not running again it 's so hard i ca n't even type those words without hopelessness creeping in and tears welling up i do n't know what i would do i should know one way or the other , whether i will run again or not , by christmas , which will be six months post op i was hoping to run a marathon by christmas i'm choosing to believe i will be one of the outliers after all , i was extremely fit prior to the disc rupturing , and perhaps i'm a bit younger than most of their patients but then i think about how little my strength has progressed over the last month , and it 's difficult to hold onto that belief but i have to keep believing and hope i'm one of the outliers so far this news has not had a crushing effect on my mood , but it has n't helped either i'm trying to move forward and stay in the moment i do n't want to allow hopelessness to resettle i can only do so much i can only control what i can control i will continue doing my exercises , walking , and riding my elliptigo i 'll focus on getting back to work and keep saying my prayers those are the best options i have right now one day at a time one moment at a time
