life really feels good today i actually feel like i have a social life now gasp , which feels rather odd p i 've been talking to friends every day , hanging out with more people i'm an introvert who has a phobia of trying new things , and is a bit of a homebody , so in the past i 've made myself a bit of a hermit at times not now ! maybe spring has something to do with it either way , this makes me very happy now i just need to actually meet see my friends who happen to live far away ! it 's bright and sunny , still cold , but purple crocuses are blooming on the lawn robin 's peck around for worms , and the grass is starting to grow spring is here in full force ! while ty was here , my focus moved away from more political things , and afterwards for a bit , things stayed that way but i finally started reading ishmael , and once again i feel impassioned by my political beliefs ishmael , by daniel quinn , could best be described as a critique of civilization , told in the form of a gorilla teaching a man to see what those of us in this society so rarely do i love how quinn looks at things from such a different angle than jensen does , yet has just as wonderful insights and thought provoking things to say there are a multitude of great quotes in ishmael , one of which is this the people of your culture cling with fanatical tenacity to the specialness of man they want desperately to perceive a vast gulf between man and the rest of creation this mythology of human superiority justifies their doing whatever they please with the world , just the way hitler s mythology of aryan superiority justified his doing whatever he pleased with europe but in the end this mythology is not deeply satisfying the takers are a profoundly lonely people the world for them is enemy territory , and they live in it like an army of occupation , alienated and isolated by their extraordinary specialness i highly reccommend this book ! also , a while ago i started talking online to an anti civilizationist who lived in montreal , and finally arranged to meet him and his friend , who is also a green anarchist , along with my sister who , although she does n't call herself one , also holds the beliefs of a green anarchist yesterday we had a lovely afternoon just sitting in the sun and talking , and some of the conversations continue to be turned around in my head for instance , although i follow some feminist blogs and such , i have n't really looked into feminism , or thought about it much at all , which seems strange considering that i'm a woman with very strong views but one of the people i met yesterday is a feminsit , and what she had to say really got me thinking i think i 'll have to write a post about gender roles in our society very soon , since tht 's something i find very interesting also , in reading , and talking to people , and living , it seems to me that we , as a culture , are really on the cusp of something more and more people are realizing just how serious our situation as a species is , and more and more people are realizing that changing a few things will come no where near solving the entire problem far more drastic changes must happen and so the green anarchist movement grows i do n't know what 's in the future , but every time i find someone else who sees the reality of our situatuation , i feel energized , hopeful , and more willing and able to take on whatever the future may bring it 's spring a time of birth , of beginnings may this springtime herald wonderful things , meaningful change , love , happiness i love spring peace , idzie you might also like green anarchy awesome revolutionary quotes quotes , quotes , and more quotes ! quotes make me happy linkwithin
