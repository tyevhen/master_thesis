dr low made it clear that practicing recovery means really applying the method not just understanding it i find myself spotting angry temper flares most easily these are not as common as my flares of fearful temper , so in general i m able to quickly spot and not begin a vicious cycle it s a different story with fearful temper usually i m on edge all day , so it s difficult to continuously spot and reassure myself with secure thoughts and the recovery tools it takes a lot of work , in fact i know intellectually what i m supposed to do , but i often feel i m not applying the method effectively yet i know enough about recovery to accept that this is just an average situation there s no need to work up these feelings , and the best course of action is to continue reading the books , attending meetings , and applying the method so when i read dr low s lecture on apprenticeship i felt much better about my progress he reminds us that we are apprentices learning a new skill , and this is accomplished neither quickly nor easily what would happen to our workers to our craftsmen if , when they begin their apprenticeship , they should become discouraged the first day ? we would have no craftsmen and yet that is what our patients do they have a passion for becoming discouraged they have a passion to be discouraged , and that means they don t consider themselves apprentices looking at recovery from nervous conditions as an apprenticeship is a refreshing perspective not only does it make sense , it is a much more authentic philosophy than many of the anxiety quick fixes that are hawked once again , dr low s enduring wisdom shines through reference low aa lecture the patient is an apprentice in manage your fears , manage your anger a psychiatrist speaks glencoe , il willett publishing co
