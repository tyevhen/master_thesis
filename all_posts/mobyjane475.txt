i missed the s having babies while friends of mine were burning their bras i was thinking this morning that i got way off track in the s due to a heavy intake of new age thinking and women 's liberation telling me i did n't need to waste my talents cleaning kitchen counters , and wiping kid 's noses , and above all i should be true to myself what did it matter that i already had four children ? it was perfectly all right to get a job , hire a nanny , or put the kids in daycare , get out in the real world and climb the ladder of success to become a ceo or found my own company my first venture was trying to be a singer songwriter i learned to play the guitar , i bought a tape recorder , and though i got so far as to actually have my songs under contract to rca in nyc , and to see a story about my trip to nashville in redbook magazine , none of my songs ever sold i ca n't tell you how many failed business ventures i engaged in over a period of ten years i started an advertising company , i started a shopper 's guide for a tourist town , i started a catalog company , i owned a framing gallery , i sold real estate , i opened a gift store , i started a greeting card company , i bought a franchise for pop wheels sandals that could turn into roller skates when you pulled the button it took me much too long to figure out that doing whatever the hell i felt like could be mistaken for being true to myself meanwhile my children were not doing well in school , my marriage was falling apart , i stopped setting the table for dinner , i was always behind the clock and if i could describe myself in one word i would have to say driven i also had to take some time out from these manic activities to spend a week or so , now and then , as i took to my bed with depression a single phrase woke me up as i was driving to work one day you should honor the major commitments of your life i never thought of that before that was n't part of the feminist movement or new age philosophy i kind of hung out with that phrase for a number of years and it was helpful when i rededicated my efforts to my marriage and my family , i realized how much time it actually takes to achieve a pleasant lifestyle how much creative effort it takes to run a home so that it is clean , attractive and unrushed clothes washed , dried and put away , kitchen counter uncluttered , with time to chat , make a cup of tea , and share the day 's events then when my family was pretty much grown , i went back to graduate school to become a therapist and help myself , because the depressive episodes kept getting worse and worse i do look back and wonder why i did n't do better when i was younger now i know all about raising kids , keeping priorities in order i'm babbling on here what 's the point ? not sure everything turned out fine for me , all five of my children are successful , good hearted people perhaps the point i want to make here is that sometimes , when you 're on the fence , that little phrase might come in handy you should honor the major commitments of your life or maybe my point is this i heard a woman recently say that she worked outside the home because she , personally , did n't get any big thrill from shining her stainless steel sink and i realized how lucky i am that i do
