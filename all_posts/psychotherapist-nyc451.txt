what does it mean to live a double life ? in this blog article , i 'll explore what it means to have a public self and a private self as well as personal fantasies , which are common to most people in a future article , i 'll compare this common behavior to the concept of living a double life the public self and the private self let 's start by exploring a common phenomenon the public and the private self on the most basic level , everyone has a public and a private self the public self is the self that , as the term implies we show to the world we usually show different aspects of this public self , depending upon the context the public self so , for instance , we might present ourselves at work in a different light than we present ourselves when we socialize with friends or loved ones or when we 're relaxing at home at work , we might be more formal , depending upon the setting , as opposed to when we 're relaxed and informal with loved ones with loved ones , we usually allow more private aspects of ourselves to reveal themselves and we 're usually different with the various people in our lives for instance , people usually allow themselves to be more emotionally vulnerable with a spouse or romantic partner than with a casual friend the private self like anything else , the different aspects of self are on a continuum generally speaking , there 's nothing unusual about having these different aspects of self , unless there 's a big disconnect with these aspects , which i 'll discuss in a future blog article fantasies of the private self aside from how we are in terms of the public and private self , we all have personal fantasies , many of which we keep to ourselves , possibly not even revealing them to those closest to us there are all kinds of fantasies , including sexual fantasies , fantasies of being successful , fantasies of being a hero , and so on fantasies of the private self fantasies are common and they 're usually forward looking when a fantasy is positive and forward looking , it can provide the beginning of a new idea it can be the beginning of a new creative endeavor by allowing oneself to think outside the box or to come up with creative solutions to problems , a new invention , artwork , and so on of course , in order for the fantasy to come to fruition , the fantasy ca n't just remain in someone 's head some action needs to be taken living a double life so far , what i 've described are common aspects of everyday life , not what would be described as living a double life in the usual sense of the term these common aspects of self , the public and private selves and inner fantasies are usually part of a more or less integrated personality and an integrated life when we use the term living a double life , we 're usually referring to someone who lives a compartmentalized life with very different aspects of him or herself hidden away from most people this is in contrast to what we 've been exploring so far , the person who has a more integrated life the person who is living a double life often has a secret part of his or her life it 's not unusual for the secret part of his or her life to be hidden away from even loved ones leading a double life that is harmful to yourself and others aside from secrecy , there 's often some form of deception involved like anything else , leading a double life can be viewed on a continuum from moderate to severe leading a double life could involve anything from cheating on a spouse to , on the more extreme level , sociopathic behavior the most severe form of leading a double life would involve sociopathic behavior that can be harmful to oneself as well as others examples of living a double life that are harmful would be engaging in infidelity having a second family that the spouse and family in the primary family know nothing about having a separate , secret identity like the main character in mad men , don draper engaging in money laundering engaging in white collar crime engaging in a ponzi scheme other attempts to defraud others and so on i 've written a prior blog article about a book that describes sociopathic and near sociopathic behavior , book almost a sociopath , so in a future blog article , i 'll focus on the more common types of living a double life on the less extreme end of the spectrum i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist who works with individual adults and couples to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at or email me josephineolivia aol com see living a double life part secrets and lies of infidelity also see my newspaper psychotherapy daily news photo credit suzylagasa via photopin cc photo credit gwilmore i hate the new layout !
