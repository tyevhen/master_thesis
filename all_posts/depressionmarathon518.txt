it was beautiful outside the air was cool , almost cold , against my skin as i set out in the morning twilight i kept my head up and ears open as my muscles groaned awake it was the first moments of my upcoming three hour journey i settled in the beauty of the sky immediately drew my attention lavender , pink , and magenta feathered across the horizon foreshadowing the arrival of day 's brilliant light the air smelled of awakening i inhaled deeply the squirrels , it appeared , had long been awake gathering , chasing , climbing and cavorting they barely noticed my passing the crows , on the other hand , boisterously squawked and chased me from above while the geese could n't have cared less overcrowding the path , hissing as i approached , they forced me to dodge them rather than the other way around i had to laugh through the woods , morning dew dripped rhythmically from the trees startled by my presence , a beautiful deer interrupted his breakfast and leapt away soon my breathing matched my footsteps , and these were for a long time the only sounds in my ears out of the woods , around the town lake , things changed there was more dodging of hissing geese , which was contrasted by panicked quack , quack , quacking and quick flap , flap , flapping of running duck feet a small herd of running ducks really creates quite a ruckus ! the lake was busy with morning exercisers by the time i arrived in my two laps around , i practically exhausted myself just saying hello a constant whirring sound puzzled me for a moment until i passed an inflatable finish line the local women 's road race was setting up for their run the busy lake gave way to a quiet neighborhood toward the end of my journey i was surrounded by manicured lawns , flowers and shrubs in between barking dogs and buzzing lawn mowers , i could actually hear the clinking of breakfast dishes and coffee cups , as windows were opened to allow the rare cool air inside finally , my path took me around the golf course , within a few feet of several tees the whoosh of clubs slicing through the air broke up those final miles shortly , i was back in my neighborhood it was the way i left it quiet and serene , not yet , it appeared , awake there were no dogs to greet me , no mowers buzzing , and nobody to whom i could say hello even the squirrels , it seemed , were on their morning break i slowed to a stop under the now bright sky tired and content , i walked up my drive i sighed an audible sigh it was the only sound i smiled and went into my house
