i have a cold nate has a bad cold i could n't get him to get out of bed this morning this is a totally foreign concept to me , a child not wanting to get out of bed ? we do n't have that in this house so i set about the morning of a busy mommy , rearranging the day figuring out logistics , making the usual plans , cancel this doctor appt , call the school , call the busdriver , call the home visit tech who is supposed to come on mondays , call the sitter to see if maybe if i say pretty please can she come a bit earlier yes , i feel crappy too but this rarely keeps me from work then nate came over to me , put his head on my knee and i said screw it my baby needs me some days you have to snuggle your baby it 's a mommy requirement there is nothing today that is more important than taking care of this sweet child so i made a few more calls , and now i have my little velcro boy snuggling on my lap excellent morning
