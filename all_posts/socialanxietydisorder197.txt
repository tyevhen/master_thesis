here are my reasons for you to consider oone reason is the question itself is often the first question parents ask to not discuss it is like the proverbial elephant in the room that everyone sees but no one talks about if approached with compassion and a heart only to help the family , it is possible for parents to look at this issue objectively and not absorb horrible amounts of blame this awareness can also give your daughter permission to talk about hurts or disappointments that have occurred in the family , and relationships can be strengthened and healed othe second reason is i do n't think parents want to be handled with kid gloves they want to know the truth , even if it hurts every parent i have worked with has said they will do anything to help their daughter , they just want to know what to do and they will do it that includes looking at their families through new eyes , because every family sees things differently once their daughter or son has an eating disorder let 's really consider this if i say to a parent it really does n't matter what causes anorexia or why this happened , you just need to move forward from here in reality that statement does n't go over very well i believe in part it is because they want to know the truth , but i also think that statement feels condescending i might as well tell them you ca n't handle the truth so let 's just not go there no one likes to be told , even if it 's veiled in compassion , they are not strong enough or capable of handling or helping their own child i think it is disrespectful not to help parents explore all pieces of the puzzle that contributed to their daughter 's life threatening illness even if it means they have to look in the mirror othe third reason is because the question itself is often a spiritual one it implies a desire to find meaning in this crisis exploring this can open the window a crack to look at life in some deeper ways when we explore why things happen , we invite growth and transformation for ourselves and our children as well what causes anorexia ?
