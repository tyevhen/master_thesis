i 've realized that i 've hardly even mentioned one of my most outgoing , shall we say , family members on this blog ! so i'm going to give a mini introduction now right now , we share our house with three furry family members two cats and a dog the dog is who i'm going to be talking about his name is winston his nicknames are many and varied , including windy , winduffy , winduffers , winston duffy , boo boo , dumbass and butt head and he 's an pound airedale terrier , the largest member of the terrier family he became a member of our family when he was months old , since his first family felt that they could n't give him the love and attention he deserved , what with busy work schedules and grown children who no longer spent much time at home they were very sad to see him go , but i'm so happy that they gave him to us ! he 's now years old , i believe , and has gotten a bit more mellow with the years , but he 's still not exactly a quiet dog ! he 's goofy , too smart for his own good , sweet natured , and energetic he loves to play , greets me every morning with great joy when i wake up , and though he 's sometimes ridiculously frustrating and has a habit of bashing into everyones knees with his very hard head , he can also always make me laugh with his antics , and will apologize with soulful eyes and kisses when he accidentally hurts someone how can you not love a dog like that ? i pulled out the camera today when winston was helping my dad to bring in wood winston loves to help with a variety of household chores his helping usually involves placing himself in the middle of whatever happens to be going on , sticking his nose into anything that looks interesting , and looming over your shoulder with a look of bright eyed curiousity if whatever you 're doing happens to be on floor level , and though some of them are a bit blurry , i figured i 'd share a couple here ! a happy dog peace , idzie
