over the last couple of weeks i have been taking dutasteride to see if it will help slow the progression i know it is too early to tell , but i have been noticing something interesting happening this last week and i wanted to share it with you i am experiencing a sensation that i have not felt for many years it might not be related to the dutasteride and it might be just coincidental , but it is interesting the feeling i am talking about is a tightness in certain muscles the kind of tightness that comes when you have exercised muscles that you have not used for some time this tightness is not a cramp or an ache it is also not the sensation of weakness you get when you overuse your muscles the best description i can give this tightness is an awakening of muscles my monday and wednesday long workout routine between minutes were quite good my shoulder exercises four routines are much easier i have increased the number of reps by to without any problem then , for several hours afterwards i feel pumped the other interesting aspect is that i am not experiencing any unusual twitching or fasciculations if anything , the fasciculations have decreased i have been cautious to not overdo at the same time i want my body to tell me when to quit a particular exercise these last few days , however , i had to tell myself to discontinue a particular exercise it is a nice feeling to not be forced to quit coincidence or not , i am liking this feeling i ll keep you appraised of any further developments
