i just finished a busy day of running , working , errands , a meeting , walking puck , and packing i 've got two more busy days ahead of me before my plane leaves for dallas on friday the dallas marathon is sunday morning i'm now experiencing the preparatory anxiety and excitement i routinely get in the days before a marathon it 's all part of the process and i like it ! things continue to go well actually , considering i discontinued one of my medications a few weeks ago , with my doctors reluctant permission , things are going extremely well my mood is good , but even better , i 've noticed i'm much less fatigued than i 've been in , well , years ! i still take a nap just about every day , but my naps are shorter , and if i miss my nap , i do n't suffer nearly as much it 's nice it 's really nice d and i are also doing well , i think we have n't seen each other since my last visit to his home in early november , but we talk frequently and text each other daily last night , d dropped a bit of a bombshell on me when he asked me to accompany him to the caribbean next month wow ! we have no definitive plans yet he 's researching it i'm pretty excited , but i'm remaining cautious in case it does n't happen it would be wonderful to spend or days together on a beach far from home i 'll let you know how things develop that 's it for today i'm filled with gratitude for the opportunities i have in life today i'm grateful to be feeling well i'm grateful for fulfilling work i'm grateful to be running well and i'm really grateful for the support of friends , professionals , the recovery community , and those of you reading this blog
