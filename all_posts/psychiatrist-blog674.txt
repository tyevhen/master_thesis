if you have n't seen anderson cooper catch a case of the giggles on live tv , you can still watch it on youtube i missed the first showing , but saw mr cooper replay it on his own ridiculist list but what 's this doing on shrink rap ? i watched the re run , and i found myself laughing out loud only , it was n't a good , happy , hearty laugh , it was an embarrassed and uncomfortable laugh , and i realized i 'd taken on the feelings of the newsman if i were a psychiatrist oops , i am , even in august , i might say that anderson cooper successfully projected his feelings on to me , or that i empathized with him , assuming he also felt embarrassed a friend mentioned he loved it , and but he did n't not feel such discomfort mr cooper seemed to enjoy replaying it , laughing at himself laughing , and said he was pleased if he made anyone smile me ? i suppose i 'll recover enjoy the video and do let us know how did that make you feel ?
