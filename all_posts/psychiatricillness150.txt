i have had a few months where i have been hypomanic for about of the time now that is over i seem to have lost the good support network i had it 's hard to get it back o i guess this is my lifetime struggle , no one elses other people and friends will come and go through my journey but the bipolar will always be there still it is a part of who i am and i must ride out the flat times i feel quite low , nothing too severe , just empty and wondering if this is how everyone else feels all the time or whether i am really low i still feel blessed to experiance life in such an animated way , i still would n't stop the illness even if i could ! i have had a bad day at work , struggling with my boss he treats me like a second class citizen and i am afraid it has got to the point where i can not talk and pass the time of day with him without him jumping on everything being patronising and even insulting interfering on with my working relationship with colleagues i do n't think anyone is out there anymore
