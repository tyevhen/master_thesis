hate may be too strong intensely dislike is a more accurate description i dislike running up steep hills however , in running as in life , there is frequently value in doing things i do n't like to do therefore , despite my intense dislike for such things , yesterday i found myself churning up some very steep hills i planned to run my usual speed workout around a local track , but when i arrived the track was unavailable on my way to the track , i passed the sign for a county park just miles up the road i noticed the sign because it brought back memories of the vaunted miler annually run through this park 's woods the race is so brutal , in fact , it 's named the gut buster ! after my last run there years ago , i vowed i would never run that race again but there i was , miles away and in need of a tough workout i tried to psych myself up as i drove to the park i planned to run the same mile loop used in the race it boasts several long , steep hills before i knew it , i was churning up the first one this is good for me this is good for me this is good for me , i panted my legs burned before i was halfway up do n't stop do n't stop do n't stop , i thought i barely got over the top when the next hill hit , and then the next , and the next , and the by the time i reached some relative flatland i wanted to quit , but i had miles to go i pressed on it hurt i did n't like it it would have been easy to stop my brain started its games what would happen if i quit ? nothing who would know ? nobody how would i feel ? momentarily relieved terrible later i pressed on as usual , i found myself relating running to life if i want to do better in running , i have to work i have to move myself , motivate myself , and press on despite discomfort or occasional pain if i want to do better in life , i have to work i have to move myself , motivate myself , and press on despite discomfort or occasional pain in the end , i have only me to please , only me to impress , only me to satisfy in the end , it is only me on whom i must rely the quality of my running , like the quality of my life , depends on me taking responsibility for my running not so much different than taking responsibility for my life
