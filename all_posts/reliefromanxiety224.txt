a very important , but quick blog post that i feel obliged to write for a long time now , i have realised how many people are suffering throughout life and with such conditions as mental illness there are so many people , whether they 've been diagnosed or not , whether it 's severe , or not so , whether it 's a terrible day , or a continuous drag of bad thoughts there are so many people out there suffering at the beginning of discovering i had an issue with anxiety , i thought i was alone in battling this i had blinkers on , but i was wrong in my belief that i was alone every day never fails to surprise me all of the 'perfect' celebrities that can result to panic because of a fear , and even the people you assume are perfect are in fact are suffering with their own battles the people you see every day , including family members , friends , teachers and colleagues may all be battling something severe of their own , even though you would never in a million years have guessed it the moral of this story is , that a person may be very good at hiding how they are feeling and a simple 'how are you doing ? ' may reveal a lot of information that they are struggling however , there are many that keep such issues close to their chests , and it may take a few times of encouraging them to speak about it if they do n't want to talk about it , that 's also okay as they will talk when they are comfortable do n't be afraid to lend a helping hand because you never know , you might be the one who keeps them going until next time , people , help the people ! amy xx
