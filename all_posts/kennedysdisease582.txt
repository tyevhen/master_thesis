i just received a call from a friend he had a triple bypass and a stent implanted a week ago he now has three weeks of rehab before he can go home from the sounds of it , he is fortunate to be alive his call reminded me of how we can become caught up in gift giving , decorating , parties , and the far too often stress associated with these events , and forget about what is truly important why does it take something like the above incident happening to a family member , or friend , to force us to take a step back and examine our priorities ? health and happiness , mixed in with a lot of love , has to be the greatest gifts we could ever give and receive from our house to yours ,
