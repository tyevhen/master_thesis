it 's my mom 's th birthday today how strange ! i never imagined my mom being i used to think was soooo old but she does n't seem soooo old even though she does n't exercise enough , or eat exactly the best food , she 's still quite active and younger than her years i am so grateful for that before i got depression and before i got sober , i took my mother for granted we had a strained relationship , and the majority , if not all , of the strain came from my end she could do little right i was n't always friendly or kind i expected a lot but was rarely happy with what i got to her credit , she persevered despite my attitude and disrespect then i got sick my life fell apart i lost everything she was there for years , she was there i did n't necessarily let her in , but she remained by my side then i tried to secretly drink myself to death i found my way to aa i got sober i apologized i opened up a crack the waters grew warmer , in part because she never left in the past few years , we 've grown closer because i 've relaxed i 've allowed her in i 've accepted her presence , her assistance , and her company with gratitude and appreciation i love her , though i still struggle telling her so i do n't know what that 's all about , but i do i'm so grateful she 's in my life i'm especially grateful that my mom stuck with me , and continues to stand by me , despite my inadequacies and faults i'm lucky she gives without expectation she takes care of me when i'm unable to care for myself she cheers me on thank you , mom i love you happy birthday
