a lot of people reacted to what i said on the summit and to my blog post i have spoken to people at wtci , and i know that my thoughts and words were well received and welcomed , and i do n't take that lightly i know that through personal correspondence with courtney martin that the needs of all women is an issue the organizers take seriously i want to make it clear that what i wrote was a reflection on only one panel the entire conference , while not perfect , was well worth my time i was especially pleased to see deb burgard 's panel on medicalization and globalization , and i'm a huge fan of michael kimmel , so that was a lot of fun and the event really opened up a lot of doors for me i definitely met a lot of really rad women , and as far as networking goes , i 've never been to a more successful function i think the concept is brilliant i think having that platform is so valuable i appreciate that i was given a space to voice my opinion i just hope we can figure out a way to open that up to everyone i had one commenter tell me that i missed the point of the conference entirely , but i think i did n't i think the point is to get the dialogue going we ca n't sit peacefully anymore feminism has problems to hash out and we need a space to do it i need to feel safe enough to call people out when i think they might be committing an injustice , and i need people to do the same for me none of us are perfect solidarity , right ? it was also a huge learning experience to me i'm pretty new to the world of feminism outside of a women 's studies classroom or between the pages the latest seal press publication , so i can really chalk up the whole experience to naivety i thought most of us had this whole intersectionality thing down i realize now that there is a lot to learn i realize there is a lot to teach as well
