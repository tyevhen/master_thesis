if you are not reading this at the reality of anxiety homepage you are reading stolen content please click here to be redirected to the original author 's page i made it through my birthday without a panic attack i did n't really do very much for it and maybe thats why i kept it pretty low key and although a part of me was sad that there was no party , no big dinner celebration where all the attention was on me and my existence , the majority of me was happy to just be panic free so i took the route of doing what i wanted i took a half day of vacation from work and went out to the mountains with a couple of mt friends to take pictures of the fall scenery i had been wanting to get up there before the weather got too cold , and photography is very relaxing for me the weather was perfect as i have said before , i am a big believer in taking up hobbies because they are very therapeutic and i think they help you to gain confidence i personally enjoy photography , blogging , and playing the piano to name a few here are a couple shots that i took it was nice to have a panic attack free birthday for the first time in years in other news , i chopped my hair i took off about three inches and i dyed it pretty dark with red highlights its about a shade darker than my natural color some days i really like it and others i think , what have i done ! ? ! i 've gotten a lot of compliments but for some reason i rarely believe any of them its hard for me to accept compliments i guess that goes back to my low self esteem , but i really think people are just being polite and i'm not blogging about this because i am fishing for compliments , because like i said , i probably would n't believe you if you did i do think its an interesting thought does anyone have a hard time excepting compliments ? on the flip side , i do n't give out compliments lightly if i give a compliment to someone , i really do mean it i ca n't stand it when people say they agree with or constantly praise either me or someone else just to break the ice , or an awkward silence , or to make people like them its so fake well either way , i am not one to cry over a haircut well i have rambled on long enough i hope everyone has had a great weekend p s the buttons at the end of this post are different ways you can share my blog many people like to use social bookmarks like stumbleupon , or del icio us , or technorati if you enjoy any of these services you can click on the button that represents the service you use to bookmark a page let me know if this is useful for you or a waste of space enjoy ! if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety
