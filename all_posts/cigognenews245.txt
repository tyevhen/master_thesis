there is a new research that sheds light on this problem see http www sciencedaily com releases htm only it is not this problem of repression that they target their target is how pain in infancy alters response to stress later in life they studied early life stress prematurity among infants who had undergone prenatal treatment , without anesthesia or painkillers they were all patients in neonatal intensive care who had a number of invasive and painful intrusions they found that when this happened , and when the pain was not dampened by medication the whole pain regulation system was changed and brain circuits were altered they found that when pain was not suppressed there was a lifelong change in stress and anxiety reactions so that later reactions to pain were lessened in short , the pain reaction was repressed and not reacted to fully so here we have evidence of repression of pain very early in life , and that this reaction set up a prototype for further reactivity the first thing that stands out is that doctors still treat newborns as unfeeling blobs that has allowed for physicians for the last many decades to operate on fetuses and newborns as blocks of flesh with no pain response this was systematic during the beginning of the last century the infants who were studied spent an average of days in intensive care with often undergoing to painful procedures it is not surprising that the system becomes activated to suppress the pain response when he is assaulted over and over again before having a life on earth this becomes a prototype and that means blocking input as an habitual response to any kind of assault later on this immediate reaction can affect the development of severe and deep depression later in life the blockage accumulates and occurs over and over again as the prototypic response the point is that it begins so early which we have always suspected what is new in their research is that when pain is blocked early on there is less of a prototype the imprint is less forceful and the brain circuits are not so readily altered the imprint is not so readily stamped in to control later automatic behavior in other words ameliorating a child s pain with a hug , kiss , soothing words or painkillers might abort the depth of the imprint that is something new and important after a surgical procedure the child needs physical support and caresses just as we all do when undergoing a trauma now we see why having a parent there immediately after birth is critical otherwise , it can imprint a basic loneliness and fear of being alone for life when the parent falls ill on the arrival of the baby there is great trauma for him if he then undergoes a time in an incubator we can imagine the damage being done all alone with no one to reassure and hug and kiss , no physical contact and support figure there this on top of no parent to hold right after birth the imprint is set and fixed the researchers noted that in the children studied about percent of them had procedures done without any analgesia the neuroscience department at georgia state university studied rat pups who had a single trauma on the day of birth there were site specific changes in their brains these changes determined how they responded to stress later on without medication to suppress pain , they call it unresolved pain , children under reacted to pain later on may i add ? they were deadened because they already had so much assault that they could hardly react any longer i think this is the missing link in the research they show what happened but not why or what it really meant there was no broadened implications , no wider context , of the research still it is damn good
