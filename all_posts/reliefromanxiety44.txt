sometimes , when someone else is struggling we do n't always know the best way to approach the situation often , it 's hard enough for us to help ourselves , let alone anyone else so i have complied a few tips and tricks to help you , if you need to help a friend or someone you care about notice the signs have they become more distant or changed their behaviour ? keep an eye out for any tell tell signs that something 's not quite right even an 'are you okay ? ' can be the gateway to the help they need offer a hand if you notice that somethings not quite right , then let them know that you 'll be there for them they may not want to talk straight away , but they will know that you are there be casual do n't set up a meeting at a cafe just to chat about mental health try and make it more relaxed so that it wo n't be the topic of conversation that way they should feel more relaxed have resources make sure you know some people who you can contact if you suspect that something is up this means that you can help in the best way you can , whenever you need to i hope this has helped reaching out and knowing that someone cares , tends to be one of the best ways to help best wishes , amy xx
