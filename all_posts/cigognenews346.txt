what they do is explain to us how psychosis happens new research informs us about the brain structures involved , but what it does is simply pin down in the brain something we have seen for years clinically both help to clarify psychedelic effects it is not that brain research is more scientific rather , it offers the cerebral corollary for what happens clinically the research is by drs carhart harris and david nutt , using mri s to pinpoint what goes on after a subject is given a small dose of psilocybin see http www beckleyfoundation org or and http www huffingtonpost com there was reduction in those areas of the brain that , inter alia , control feelings and their rise into the top level cognitive cortex it also seems to unhinge parts of the limbic system , including the anterior cingulate cortex basically it allows lower level imprints to rise unabated into the thinking area and from there , because as someone said , it is like trying to drink from a fire hose , there is an inundation and flooding the brain regions dealing with constricting conscious awareness give way and we get exactly , not approximately , what happens in psychosis the difference is that in psychosis there is a slow accretion of imprinted pain that finally damages the gating system and feelings rise and flood the thinking cortex exactly what happens much quicker with psychedelics the gates are open in either case the pain is the same nothing changes except the time to takes to damage the gates and allowing flooding and what happens when there is flooding ? the cortex is exigently pressed into service to cover over the rising feelings with whatever ideas and imagination the person brain can concoct they have a bizarre quality to them because they arise not out of specific feelings but from an amalgam of them the fire hose is spritzing everywhere and the brain is forced to use its latest developing structure , the neo cortex , to join the fray i repeat this is no different from lifelong lack of love and trauma that puts cracks in the defense system including lowering serotonin supplies , which then ultimately gives way when it defense does not give way but only weakens we get add attention deficits where the gates are leaky and cannot properly contain the upsurge the feelings rise and are scattered but do not produce full blown psychosis but they prevent careful and sedulous attention to each task there are too many tasks , too much input that breaks up focus and concentration the brain is forced to pay attention to multiple inputs leaky gates , and cannot do it in this way we could say that add is the forerunner , the harbinger , of a psychosis to come this only means that the gates are leaky and will not withstand further trauma input the beginning signs of a collapsing defense system can be delusions this happens often with lifelong use of marijuana which gnaws away at defenses all this means according the study cited above is that the areas of the brain that control memory retrieval are faulty and do not function well what some drugs including psychedelics do is facilitate the retrieval of memory the problem is with these drugs , there is too much retrieval all at once and the top level cannot integrate it and when there are leaky gates brought on by drugs you get continued and long lasting sleep problems as rising feelings agitate without cease the feelings rise to just below cortical levels so that the top level is constantly stimulated , and falling into sleep becomes impossible sometimes a lone feeling may come up such as feeling unsafe throughout childhood occasionally the person can focus on one thing to alleviate the agitation if i try the door knob twenty times a day i will feel safe often there is no awareness of the role of the obsession the person simply feels better if she can try the door knobs the ritual alleviates latent anxiety this is the difference between what seems like pure statistical science and clinical science clinically , we see the relationship among disparate phenomena we understand why this happens and that does not we are not bound exclusively by the facts that is , we have a frame of reference in which to place the facts this frame of reference is truth beyond facts it gives meaning to the facts and broadens our understand of what it all means this does not mean that we do not use brain science to further our understanding , but that seeing all this in action explains so much and takes us beyond pure statistics as i said many times we are after biologic truths , not simply statistical data it is data with imagination that we need
