hi friends ! i'm so sorry it 's been so long since my last update the holidays had us buzzing all around , and then i developed a horrible cold the day i got home from our new years weekend i 've been sick ever since mostly trapped on the couch and unable to do much of anything i'm finally on some pregnancy safe antibiotics and hopefully that will help move things along ! no belly photo update yet , i'm afraid it 's starting to really pop out now , so next week will provide a better view plus , i feel and look like crap so there you go in other news , chris has painted the nursery and we had pale oak hardwood floors installed there last weekend , he also put together the crib and the bookcase it 's really starting to look like a real baby 's room now ! there 's still a lot left to do , but i'm thrilled with the progress and so grateful to my husband for all his hard work little p is so lucky to have him for a dad he goes above and beyond for his little lady already ! here are some sneak peek photos of the room i 'll be sure to take photos of the finished product when it 's done should be in mid february at the latest as for how little p is doing she 's great ! as of monday we were at weeks pregnant she 's quite the mover and shaker lately ! i 've started recognizing her patterns of rest and movement it 's always a thrill to feel her jiggling around in there she 's most active at am and at about pm she also likes to move around a lot when it 's time for bed i know that my change in position means she has to find a comfy new position as well my latest doctor 's appointment went well they are having me come back every two weeks for an ultrasound starting in february to check her growth progress due to the missing artery in her umbilical cord and i will start going for non stress tests at the hospital around week that will continue on until the birth to make sure she is ok in there i'm so grateful for the careful and deliberate care i'm receiving from my doctors they are a cautious bunch who always would rather be safe than sorry that makes me feel like i can rest easy knowing all is being done to make sure little p is safe well , that 's all for now i 've been pondering random observations about my pregnancy in general so i 'll write a little more about that tomorrow be well everyone ! save
