a new review of unexpected light the fifth ! has just appeared in eclectica have a look i 've now got thirty songs up on soundclick have a listen and report back i'm writing a poem a day for national poetry month , however bad here are the first two for april and nd craving i want a hand rolled cigarette , only the best tobacco i am not an amateur i have been at this a long time brown gold leaf rolled in sweet rice paper warm rush inhaled from a thousand thousand fires our ancestors kindled announcing mastery to predator and prey , carried by coals from cave to cave blast of nicotine brain to attention , galvanometers will tell you what you already know this drug will juice you this drug will goose you there 's no excuse , you your mustache reeks of it you 've stained your teeth with it your gums recede from it this magic smoke will stiffen your bronchi and petrify the air sacs into fibrosed honeycombs then there 's the cough , hack , mucus , wheeze , blow , cough , hack cycle , searching for butts in the sand of the theater tray , freezing your ass off at night 'cause nobody gets to smoke inside let me go , tobacco , from the valley of my addiction to the mount of holiness from the pit of my damaged will to the city of willingness make me transparent as water , let no cell go unturned , untwist the mutated dna in my distant bronchioles , say halt to plaque in coronaries , too i 'll burn sage in my doorway to the departed spirits of fire from a thousand thousand fires once carried as coals all in homage , desperate homage to the fiery rootlets you have lodged deep in my mind 's pre history not taxidermy who has shut the fortress of my mouth and trashed the drawbridge of my tongue ? whence my silence ? i was a poet once , words spilled out of me like coins from a slot machine i 'd collect them in rolls organized by topic and flair and call it poetry now the machine wo n't spit a silver metaphor , much less a copper one i once calculated how much i 'd earned by writing poetry it came to pennies an hour , pennies an hour the minimum wage in california is i should have mopped mcdonald 's floors or stuffed burritos at del taco but all of this is false collage , pastel paper on wet cardboard you know the real reason it 's a disease , this scribbling , gypsy dance of fingers , a mania for exploring attics , for squeezing fruit until unrecognizable , give me a young mind to mold and i 'll squeeze all the juice out of it and drink it up as a transfusion for my poor enervated muse beware , old poets can be parasites they want the glory of the disease , not the stolid echo of past publications hanging like dried roses around a stuffed horse 's head stuffed horses , yes , what roy rogers had done to trigger , there 's a feat for any taxidermist to admire they want the real horse , the one out to stud , not for the glue farm this pieces are rough drafts and not to be mistaken for considered , polished pieces i have neglected this blog of late perhaps new poems will keep me posting kilobunny , ce
