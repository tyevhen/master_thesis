as i have the past several nights , i spent much of last night awake i think my mood has recovered a little bit , but part of my brain is apparently unaware it 's on overdrive worry thoughts , negative thoughts , future concerns they are all crowded in there and wanting to be heard unfortunately , they 've recently chosen the middle of the night or very early morning as the time to clamor out do n't you hate that ? it 's not like there 's anything i can do about anything , no matter how much the thoughts clamor , in the middle of the night yet clamor on they do last night was no different thought after thought took its turn , each one making a racket , one louder than the last i covered my head with the pillow i rolled from side to side and flipped from front to back i turned on the television i turned off the television bathroom trips were routine but sleep was elusive , and it did n't last daylight was the only thing which successfully sent the thoughts away but i know they 're still there like vampires they 're hidden now in the dark recesses of my mind , waiting , it seems , for the moon to shine before making their boisterous rounds again
