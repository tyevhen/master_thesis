my depression has been off the charts lately i went through a brief period of hypomania , complete with excess spending , lack of need for sleep , and pressured speech , which was fun but last week , i fell faster than a dead bird from the sky and crashed so hard it physically hurt this prompted my psychiatrist to wonder about the possibility of bipolar disorder ! what ? ? ? ? whatever the diagnosis , however , the pain is unchanged i m so tired of talking about the pain i m so tired of battling the pain i ve been locked up in my incredibly disorganized and messy home , unable to sleep , write , or even move occasionally i ve given up on healthy coping it s amazing how quickly the old habits , the ones used purely for escape , swoop back in perhaps on the wings of that dead bird falling from the sky i have minimally struggled with the desire to drink , but i ve still got more in my arsenal than alcohol shopping , eating junk , obsessing about eating junk , self harm , and suicide these are all old standbys which have crept from the dark recesses of my brain within the past week , hopelessness has been more prevalent than at any time during the past years , and the hopelessness didn t scare me that was scary so why am i telling you this ? well from the few posts i was able to enter on my own blog i received grateful comments from others who could totally relate i was spilling out hopelessness , discouragement and pain , yet others were glad to read it the words i wrote and the feelings i spilled helped them connect , which in turn helped me feel less alone i am so grateful for the readers who left those comments while i am piercingly sad for their pain , their comments humble me and inspire renewed purpose in aa , we encourage working with others to decrease our self focus and distress i forget that when i m suffocating in the thick fog of depression but it works depression sucks it is the most isolating illness i ve ever experienced i am so grateful for those of you who read my words despite the sometimes less than inspiring content it is my wish that these words today , words i d rather not write , words i d prefer to replace with something more healing and hopeful , will touch at least one of you when you re touched , i m relieved together , perhaps we can join hands in cyberspace , if only for a moment , and feel connected not alone feel free to take my hand i totally get it
