one of biology 's big open questions is why organisms differ so much with regard to the relative amounts of gc and at in their dna you 'd think that if there are only two kinds of dna base pairs see diagram they 'd be more or less equally abundant not so there are organisms with dna that 's mostly gc and or cg pairs there are organisms with very at rich dna and within the chromosomes of higher organisms you find large gc rich regions isochores in the midst of great swaths of at rich dna dna contains adenine and thymine in equal amounts , and guanine and cytosine in equal amounts , but it does not usually contain gc pairs and at pairs in equal amounts and it does n't seem as if there is an optimum gc at ratio the gc at ratio varies by species within a species , it 's constant there are two really odd facts at work here the gc content of dna varies by species , and it varies a lot evolution does n't seem to trend toward an optimum cg at ratio of any kind if there were such thing as an optimum gc at ratio for dna , surely microorganisms would 've figured it out by now instead , we find huge diversity there are bacteria on every point in the gc spectrum , running from gc for the dna of candidatus carsonella ruddii a symbiont of the jumping plant louse to for anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans cp c a soil bacterium at each end of the spectrum you find aerobes and anaerobes extremophiles and blandophiles pathogens and non pathogens about the only generalization you can make is that the smaller an organism 's genome is , the more likely it is to be rich in a t low gc genome size correlates loosely with gc content the very smallest bacteria tend to have at rich low gc dna the huge diversity in gc at ratios among bacteria is impressive but does it simply represent a random walk all over the possibility space of dna ? or do the various points on the spectrum constitute special niches with important advantages ? what advantage could there be for having high gc dna ? or high at dna ? some subtle clues tell us that this is not just random deviation from the mean first , suppose we agree for sake of argument that lateral gene transfer lgt is common in the microbial world a point of view i happen to agree with over the course of millions of years , with pieces of dna of all kinds high gc , low gc flying back and forth , lgt should force a regression to the mean it should make genomes tend toward a gc at ratio that clearly has n't happened and then there 's ordinary mutational pressures it 's beginning to be fairly well accepted see hershberg and petrov , evidence that mutation is universally biased toward at in bacteria , plos genetics , , , e , full version here that natural mutation is strongly biased in the direction of at by virtue of the fact that deamination of cytosine and methylcytosine which occurs spontaneously at high frequency leads to replacement of 'c' with 't' , hence gc pairs becoming at pairs the strong natural mutational bias toward at says that all dna should creep in the direction of low gc and end up well below gc but again , this is not what we see we see that high gc organisms like anaeromyxobacter and many others maintain their dna 's unusually high gc content across millions of generations even middle of the road organisms like e coli with gc content do n't slowly slip in the direction of high at low gc clearly , something funny is going on for a super high gc organism like anaeromyxobacter to maintain its dna 's super high gc content against the constant tug of mutations in the at direction , it must be putting significant energy into maintaining that high gc percentage but why ? why pay extra to maintain a high gc ? and how does the cost get paid ? i think i 've come up with a possible answer it has to do with dna replication cost , where cost is figured in terms of time needed to synthesize a new copy of the dna for cell division anything that favors low replication cost high replication speed should favor survival that 's my main assumption my other assumption is that dna polymerases the enzymes involved in replication are not clairvoyant they ca n't know , until the need arises , which of the four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates datp , dttp , dgtp , dctp will be needed at a given moment , to elongate the new strand of dna when the need arises for let 's say an 'a' , the 'a' in the form of datp has to come from an existing endogenous pool of dntps containing all four bases datp , dttp , dgtp , dctp in whatever concentrations they 're in the enzyme has to wait until a datp if that 's what 's needed randomly happens to lock into the active site odds are only one in four assuming equal concentrations of dntps of a datp coming along at exactly the right moment odds are out of that some incorrect dntp either dgtp , dttp , or dctp will try , and fail , to fit the active site first , before datp comes along but imagine that your dna is g c and suppose you 've regulated your intracellular metabolism to maintain dgtp and dctp in a ratio over datp and dttp the odds of a good random first hit go up to simulate the various possibilities , i wrote software in javascript that simulates dna replication , where the template dna molecule is base pairs in length and the dntp pool size is bases the software allows you to set the organism 's genome gc to whatever you want , and also set the dntp pool 's relative gc percentage to whatever you want the template dna is just a random string of a , t , g , and c bases total , reflecting their relative abundances as set in the gc parameter the pool of dntps is set up to be a randomized array again reflecting abundances set in a gc parameter the way the software works is this read a base off the template fetch a base randomly from the base pool if the base happens to be the one out of four that 's called for , score '' for the timing parameter , and continue to read another base off the template if the base was not the one that 's called for , put it back in the pool array in a random location , then randomly fetch another base from the pool and increment the timing parameter for each fetch , the timing parameter goes up by keep fetching and throwing back bases until the proper base comes up , incrementing the time parameter as appropriate the time parameter keeps track of the number of fetch attempts when the correct base turns up , the pool shrinks by one base in other words , replication consumes the pool , but as i said earlier , the pool contains ten times as many bases to start as the dna template so the pool ends up smaller at the end of replication each point on this graph represents the average of monte carlo runs , each run representing complete replication of a bp dna template , drawing from a pool of , bases the blue points are runs that used a dna template containing g c content the red points are runs that used dna with g c the x axis represents different base pool compositions see text for details click for larger image i ran monte carlo simulations for dna templates having gc contents of , , and , using base pools set up to have anywhere from gc to in increments the results for the gc and gc templates representing high and low gc organisms are shown in the above graph each point on the graph represents the average of complete replication runs the y axis shows the average number of fetches per dna base so , a low value means fast replication a high value means slower dna replication the x axis shows the percentage of gc in the base pool , in recognition of the fact that relative dntp abundances in an organism may vary , in accordance with environmental constraints as well as with organism specific homeostatic setpoints maximal replication speed the low point of each curve happens at a base pool gc percentage that is displaced in the direction of the dna 's own gc so , for the gc organism blue data points , max replication efficiency comes when the base pool is about gc for the gc organism red points the sweet spot is at a base pool gc concentration of why this is not exactly symmetrical with the other curve , i do n't know but bear in mind , these are monte carlo runs some variation is to be expected the interesting thing to note is that max replication efficiency , for each organism , comes at fetches per base pair y axis cache that thought it 'll be important in a minute the real jaw dropper is what happens when you plot a curve for template dna with gc content in the graph below , i 've shown the gc runs as black points the red and blue points are exactly as before this is the same graph as before , but with replication data for a gc genome black points again , each data point represents the average of monte carlo runs notice that the black curve bottoms out at a higher level than the red or blue curves this means replication is less efficient for the gc genome notice that the best replication efficiency comes in the middle of the graph no big surprise , but check the y value the very fastest dna replication , when the dna template is gc , requires fetches per base , compared to best case base fetching efficiency of for the gc and gc dnas what does this mean ? it means dna replication , in a best case scenario , is more efficient for the skewed gc organisms the difference between and is this goes a long way toward explaining why gc extremism is stable in organisms that pursue it there is replication efficiency to be had in keeping your dna biased toward high or low gc it does n't seem to matter which consider the dynamics of an atp drawdown the energy economy of a cell revolves around atp , which is both an energy molecule and a source for the adenine that goes into dna and rna one would expect normal endogenous concentrations of atp to be high relative to other ntps for a low gc organism , that 's also a near ideal situation for dna replication , because high at in the base pool puts you near the max replication speed part of the curve see blue points a sudden drawdown in atp when the cell is in crisis shifts replication speed to the right hand part of the blue curve , slowing replication significantly this is what you want if you 're an intracellular symbiont or a mitochondrion , incidentally you want to stop dividing when the host cell is unable to divide because of an energy crisis consider the high gc organism red dots , on the other hand if atp levels are high during normal metabolism , replication is not as efficient as it could be , but so what ? it just means you 're willing to tolerate less efficient replication in good times but as atp draws down perhaps because nutrients are becoming scarce , dna replication actually becomes more efficient this is what you want if you 're a free living organism in the wild you want to be able to continue replicating your dna even as atp becomes scarce and indeed that 's what happens according to the red data points as the base pool becomes more gc rich , replication efficiency increases the best efficiency comes when base pool a t is down around i think these simulations are meaningful and i think they help explain the dna composition extremism seen among microorganisms if you 're a professional scientist and you find these results tantalizing , and you 'd like to co author a paper for plos genetics or another journal , please get in touch my google mail is kas dot e dot thomas i 'd like to coauthor with someone who is good with statistics , who can contribute more ideas to this line of investigation i think these results are worth sharing with the scientific community at large
