today 's post is more of a note to self than anything else i'm always trying to remember how the various browsers identify themselves to servers the attendant user agent strings are impossible to carry around in one 's head , so i'm setting them down here for future reference to get the user agent strings for five popular browsers plus acrobat , i created a script an ecmascript server page in my sling repository that contains the line sling getrequest getheader user agent this line simply spits back the user agent string for the requesting browser obviously the results for the browsers i happen to have on my local machine are as follows firefox mozilla windows u windows nt en us rv gecko firefox chrome mozilla windows u windows nt en us applewebkit khtml , like gecko chrome safari ie mozilla compatible msie windows nt slcc net clr net clr safari mozilla windows u windows nt en us applewebkit khtml , like gecko version safari opera opera windows nt u en presto version acrobat pro extended mozilla windows u windows nt en us applewebkit khtml , like gecko version safari interestingly , acrobat seems to spoof a safari signature if you want to perform this test yourself right now , using your present browser , simply aim your browser at http whatsmyuseragent com , and you 'll get a complete report on the full header sent by your browser to the server
