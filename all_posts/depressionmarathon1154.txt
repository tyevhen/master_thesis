three letters never before associated with my name d n f i walked off the course today at mile i was on pace to qualify , but my body was expending so much energy attempting to stay warm , i knew i was not going to be on my feet much longer if i continued the weather called for showers that were supposed to start later in the morning or early afternoon unfortunately , the rain and wind began within minutes of the start the temperature dropped , and then it began to pour ! a steady downpour continued from approximately miles around mile , we turned a corner and things went from barely tolerable to worse a stiff , cold wind whipped us from the left by the time i walked off the course of a mile later , the temp was only in the mid 's , which meant the windchill factor must have been around freezing ! i decided to live for another day rather than risk my health , my body and my mind by struggling through another miles i have never not finished a race before i'm going to take a few days off , and then look for another marathon to enter within the next two months it was brutal being bussed to the finish line , at which i arrived just as i would have been finishing watching hundreds of runners finishing under four hours , i thought , why them and not me ? but i think i made a good decision , even though it is n't sitting very well right now tough day p s insult to injury as i sit here typing this , one hour after i should have finished , the sun just came out and the temperature is on the rise gotta love the marathon !
