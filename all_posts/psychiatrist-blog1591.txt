what 's your favorite mood stabilizer ? i set up the sidebar poll a couple of weeks ago , right on the heels of the what 's your favorite ssri ? poll the shrink rap poll was actually mentioned on the wall street journal health blog yup , we 've arrived in blogger nirvana , move over fat doctor ! these are funny questions , they 're asked without context , kind of purposely so what 's your favorite ? but we do n't ask who you are , the doctor or the patient , or perhaps the relative of someone who never actually prescribed or swallowed the pill and we do n't ask your experience is this the only mood stabilizer you 've taken ? are you a family practice resident who has only written prescriptions ever for mood stabilizers ? or are you an experienced bipolar expert who has written many many scripts and really knows your stuff ? roy did n't like the poll to begin with i went for the cheesy blogger poll , too lazy to import a bigger one from polldaddy , and it limits the number of choices roy wanted klonopin added he wanted trileptal he wanted topamax he scoffed what can i say ? and apparently either no one likes or uses tegretol carbamazapine so that was a waste of a choice i had more to say about ssri choices i 'll think of something to say about mood stabilizers just not tonight for now , please vote thank you
