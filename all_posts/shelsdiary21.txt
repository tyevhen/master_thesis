without trying to sound like a nineties chick lit clich i have major trust issues it 's never really occurred to me before in fact , i do n't think i had these issues with any previous boyfriend i always believed what they said to me and trusted them for the most part this worked well it worked well until i developed this obsession with being 'mugged off' being 'mugged off' is a term that has been thrown about a lot lately , especially since lee from blue led on two relatively unknown glamour models in the celebrity big brother house but i have been using 'mugged off' long before casey wailed it in the diary room on day to me , being 'mugged off' means someone usually a dude intentionally telling you a porky of which you trustingly believe it 's not until you hear the truth usually from a completely innocent bystander that you even realise you have been subject to such 'mugging off' this leaves you , me and poor glamour model casey feeling like an absolute idiot an absolute idiot to have believed a word that came out of his horrible little mouth this is where , i think , i then take it to the next level following the feeling of foolishness , i then feel like the upper hand is given to the lier dude scumbag that somewhere in the world he will be bragging to his mates about how he played me , he he made me look so stupid ! and stupid is the last thing i want to look ever this is where the 'mugging off' really gets to me i did n't realise any of this until i got talking to my new therapist , er i mean housemate my new , ahem , housemate listens to me intently as i relay my latest boy stories and how i feel about them he always offers such sound advice recently i have been talking him through a few boy tales tales of guys saying one thing and doing the other this , to me , is classic 'mugging off' my fear of being the receiver of such behaviour has led me to dis trust pretty much anything a boy ever says my irrational mis trust has been even more boosted these last few days when my housemate confessed that boys intentionally tell porkies just to make themselves look good ! now , instead of just mis trusting their intention with me , their whereabouts on a tuesday night and if they do in fact even like me , i find myself also questioning their rather gallant opinion on animal cruelty or third world poverty ! i know , i know i have taken all this a little too far sure , it 's good to keep your guard up , to protect yourself a little but you have to let go of some craziness sometimes right ? is it a case of trusting until proven guilty or is it more a case of building up the trust my therapist says trust is something to build and i suppose that 's right let 's just hope i do n't find out my therapist has been 'mugging me off' as well
