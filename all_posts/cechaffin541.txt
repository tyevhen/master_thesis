i'm posting a picture of me and my brother at a beach i find the picture uplifting , though at the time it was taken i was seriously depressed yes , i'm the brother who does n't smile i also post below a poem that 's worth sticking on your refrigerator , though i think it 's a cut above blue mountain arts i do this to celebrate the miracle of my mood change that began yesterday tonic i will love myself today here are some fuzzy slippers and a lollipop , a warm hug and a wet kiss let me tuck this old familiar blanket around my shoulders and read this poem before i nap whatever i do today , i ll approve if i spill milk , i ll clap if i button my shirt wrong it s a new style if i wet my pants it was on purpose my , how well i walk ! how well i speak ! it s so good to be good to myself where have i been all these sad , long years ? published in tryst there 's a whole lot of my work in this issue unbelievable ! after suffering a serious depression for nearly four months , i 've felt well for two days medically i'm sure it 's due to my increase in the zyprexa dosage along with an increase in wellbutrin truly , i was close to calling my old psychiatrist in orange county for outpatient ect , though lacking insurance that would no doubt be beyond my means even the medications below i can hardly afford lamictal costs about four dollars a tablet at costco , the cheapest pharmacy i know for me that means eight dollars a day , but i gotta have it prior to this depression it was the only medication i took regularly for my condition here 's the cocktail that turned me around , though i do n't trust my footing just yet zyprexa mg at bedtime klonopin mg at bedtime lithium mg at bedtime prozac mg in the morning wellbutrin mg in the morning , mg in the afternoon lamictal mg in the morning and afternoon all the literature maintains that a manic depressive 's depression is the most refractory of depressions to treat , especially if it comes on the heels of mania i post this list for the sake of other sufferers them 's a lot of damned drugs , but sometimes it takes a big combination to reverse the neurotransmitter deficits i discovered the synergistic effect of prozac and wellbutrin in my last bad depression of nearly a year my shrink had me on mg of prozac , then switched me to wellbutrin there was still a lot of prozac in my blood when he gave me he wellbutrin i remember my mood flipping just like it has now suddenly i appreciated flowers and the roundness of women 's posteriors , something i could n't do for months prior to my depression vanished in three days and i resumed taking the prozac because the wellbutrin only worked in conjunction with the prozac in my case later i read in psychiatric journals of studies that confirmed this but my experience predated those papers in medical school i was taught by neurologists , in treating seizures , to keep adding medicines until the seizures were controlled i think the same applies to treating mood disorders william styron in darkness visible thought depression too mild a word to describe the condition he thought brain fever more appropriate thus the model for seizure treatment i think also applies to serious mood disorders just keep adding the meds until something breaks and when it breaks for me , as in these last two days , i go from minus to plus in a flash enduring the depression was soul crushing , but i 've now had two good days , amazing days when kathleen sent me to the store yesterday for fruit i had no trouble making decisions that was amazing and my anhedonia is poof ! gone i'm back in the wonderful world of color , freed from my black and white prison may my euthymia continue hallelujah and amen ! i should mention my beautiful and compassionate wife , kathleen , who took excellent care of me during this illness having her near helped me endure the snow inside the fire of willful self abnegation keep your fingers crossed , ce
