work was good today , i was productive and i enjoyed it my boss said some really nice things to me this afternoon about how far i have come in the last months compared to how i used to be he said that hehas received a lot of good feedback about how different i am now to how i was months ago he said he loves working with me and i am one of the bravest people he knows he said he was looking forward to my performance review next week i could not ask for more support but i still did not tell him that i was not at work yesterday because i could not get up ! i explained to him how i find a good review at least as stressful as a bad one and he promised to keep that in mind next week i find it stressful , the better i am doing the higher the expectations on me are and the more i have to loose if it all goes wrong again i went to the gym on the way home , i spent mins on the exercise bike and then did a yoga class i felt energised afterwards i went to mc d 's for tea i am going to read angels and demons by dan brown
