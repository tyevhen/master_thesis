years ago , when observing primals , i noticed that there was , first of all , a resonance where one level triggered off similar feelings on lower levels this was not random it was as if the system were reaching back in its memory bank to find help and or a more efficient defense to combat current trauma it was reaching into its memory to find the best solution to combat and adapt it reaches to see what we did before when the going got tough so first , it drops to childhood to find answers and ultimately it reaches down to the brainstem to see how we handled danger and threat , originally back years i noted that a woman whose car ran off the road , totally froze and could not take the wheel to save her life it was the parasympathetic nervous system that dominated the other example i used was the man whose business was failing and decided to use up all his money pursuing a useless lawsuit he was constantly aggressive and fighting all the time he was driven by his brainstem survival mode of struggle he could not stop because stop meant death there are variations to all of this , but the point is that we revert to lower brain levels in the face of danger why is this so important ? new research that tells us that , cancer evolved to protect us scientific american , oct , z meraldi , see http www scientificamerican com article did cancer evolve to protect us what ? we get cancer as a means of protection and adaptation for survival ? it could be they want to go back to evolution to explain the appearance of cancer and guess what ? they recommend treatment with oxygen , inter alia they never said or knew that perhaps oxygen deprivation during gestation could be one cause of afflictions they simply tried to rethink cancer from the bottom up paul davies , arizona state , c lineweaver , national university of canberra and mark vincent , london health sciences and we think first , from the bottom up and then the top down for example , we take a certain belief and trace it down through the patient s feelings we know how the feeling builds into belief systems later on and how to treat it , if it indeed needs treating resonance works in both directions at all times without this concept i don t know how anyone could treat a patient let s get back to cancer even though i think the concept applies to many catastrophic diseases , meaning that they have their origin when threats were life endangering and catastrophic and catastrophic input usually means catastrophic output , or symptoms that is why alzheimers disease has , in my opinion , such early beginnings and why the worst diseases are so opaque they have very , very early origins and we cannot imagine that womb life predominates experience before we have words to explain to doctors seems so distant and non verifiable oops , i said i was getting back to cancer , so i d better here is what the article says the effects of oxygen levels on cancer have been independently investigated for many years and appear to support davies ideas they noted that slightly elevate oxygen levels can begin to induce leukemia cell death without harming normal cells when they supplied a little extra oxygen it helped in cancer therapy with human patients they also recommend immunotherapy to bolster the immune system to fight off newly developing cancer cells research we did in england theirs is what they call , the atavistic model when cancer starts to appear key cells revert to their primitive origins and here is what is crucial when this happens , more recently evolved gene cells lose their function top levels , in short abdicated their function and ceded to primitive coping mechanisms that is my leitmotif , as well which is why the lady who went off the road froze and could no longer help to save her life only in in my therapy we permit the regression and understand it as healthy , not an aberration and they are not driving a car while going back in time and they really do go back until eventually they lose all capacity to articulate language we understand the bottom to top top to bottom relationships we need oxygen during the trauma and we add it now to treat it , even though the cause is unknown to so many it is called evolution
