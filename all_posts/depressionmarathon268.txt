i'm just now reclining after a wonderful weekend with my boyfriend , d he arrived friday afternoon in time for us to catch dinner before going to a concert i had n't been to a concert in quite a long time it was fun ! on saturday morning we lounged , exercised , and then lounged again before heading out to lunch at a highly recommended small town cafe about minutes from here the recommendations were dead on the food was delicious , and the desserts were amazing ! we took our time , enjoyed our food , chatted with the owners , and watched the locals , who all knew each other , come and go before heading home saturday night we went to a movie and had a small , late dinner at a new thai restaurant again , our food was wonderful we were laughing at ourselves , as we joked about eating our way through southern minnesota i do n't really cook , so when d is here we do eat out a lot and we enjoy it after another lazy morning this morning , we took jet for a long walk through the woods we had a nice talk as we took in the crisp fall day snow is in the forecast , so that may have been our last opportunity to enjoy crisp air and a carpet of leaves we had another good meal at one of our favorite restaurants and spent part of the afternoon on the sofa watching a football game together halfway through the game , it was time for d to go that 's the hard part living four hours apart is tough i hate when we have to leave each other we see each other so infrequently , less than once per month , i try to soak in every minute we 're together but that does n't make separating any easier after the long hug goodbye , one of us always has to walk out the door it 's not easy of course i feel sad when he goes , but i do n't let myself wallow there i 've gotten pretty good at redirecting my thoughts as i am now , reflecting on our time together brightens my mood i'm already looking forward to seeing d again , likely around christmas , at which point we 'll begin our weekend routine once again until we decide to take this relationship one step further , and one of us me makes a big move , this is the way it is love from a distance is n't easy , but i think we 're making it work
