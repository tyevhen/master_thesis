hi friends ! i'm on day of being by myself with the kiddos so far so good ! yesterday was hard i wo n't lie not hard work , but i guess it was just stressful for me with lots of juggling laundry , dishes , paige 's needs she has a cold just like me and her dad , her providers coming in and out the exterminator making his monthly upkeep visit noah 's needs , my needs i managed it all , even during paige 's several afternoon tantrums some overlapping with noah 's crying for food the only thing i left out was to eat my own lunch oh well i'm finding that i'm at the mercy of little noah 's feedings i cannot control when they fall so it 's hard to plan the day around anything and little paige has to learn to accept that i'm out of commission during these feedings and that she has to wait a hard lesson for her , but she 's doing better than i thought she would paige is extremely loving and caring toward her brother whenever she sees him she sends many tender words and pats his way she also likes to kiss his head and sing him songs such a lucky brother ! noah has been a dreamboat he sleeps in hour chunks , wakes up and gives a little raptor like yelp for food which i oblige with a bottle he 's already taking about ounces per feeding ! he 's not even a month old yet yikes ! he 's so calm and quiet and just peers around while he 's awake so , i un swaddle him and let him watch us play when his kicks slow down , i re swaddle him and he zonks back out in his little degree recline chair placed in the pack n play in the living room that 's pretty much it ! we 'll see how that changes as he gets older , but for now i'm soaking in the honeymoon of his disposition and hoping it lasts ! i'm very grateful for his calmness ! i have so much i want to write about in this space i just need to organize my thoughts and get typing ! thanks for visiting and for checking in thank you , also , for your kind words and letters they mean so much to us and i'm so thankful for you ! i 'll be back soon with the organized thoughts i mentioned hopefully we 'll see how these next feedings go ! save you might also like weeks weeks days on the other side linkwithin
