a couple of weeks ago , dr chris grunseich from nih was the guest on the kda chat room bio christopher grunseich , md is a clinical research fellow who is working in dr fischbeck s lab at the nih ninds on basic science and clinical studies in sbma chris completed his medical school training at suny stony brook and neurology residency at georgetown university he and angela kokkinis are completing an exercise study in sbma and anticipate starting other clinical studies soon dr grunseich brought us up to date on the exercise trial as well as two proposed trials that could be started within the next six to twelve months he also answered several questions related to kennedy s disease , something the doctor mentioned was very interesting to me i have been taking b vitamins for some time i have also been experiencing increased neuropathy the last few years dr grunseich said that those of us living with kennedy s disease should avoid high doses of b because it worsens the neuropathy systems the normal dosage in a multi vitamin should be fine he also said that we should consider taking additional supplements of b because it is good for the nervous system reference the exercise trial , dr grunseich said , the exercise study has been going well they need a few more participants to finish the study so far the exercises have been tolerated well by all of the participants we are looking at two different types of exercises both types of exercises so far appear to cause no significant harm , and we have not had to stop the study for any participants because they became too weak anyone interested in participating in the trial should contact angela kokkinis at this email address akokkinis cc nih gov also of interest to me was the comment about the liver the liver function is something we are exploring since patients have reported to have elevated liver function tests , and this is thought to come mostly from muscle however , some patients have had liver ultrasounds which show liver fat it is interesting to us that there may be liver involvement , since the androgen receptor is expressed in the liver and igf is synthesized in the liver we do not yet know whether or not the liver changes are harmful or if they are benign i will be following this study closely
