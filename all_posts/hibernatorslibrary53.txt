gods behaving badly , by marie phillips , read by rosalyn landor it 's hard for the greek gods in the modern world they 've lost most of their power , and are stuck living in a dilapidated house in london in order to make a living , aphrodite answers sex calls , apollo is a tv psychic , and artemis is a dog walker they still treat humans with the same snide disregard , though when apollo insults aphrodite , she decides to take revenge on him by making him fall in love with a homely young woman , alice , who is their housemaid this sets off a storm of bad luck for everyone involved this was a funny book with an interesting twist on gods in modern world sub genre it had its ups and downs as far as writing went , though it was funny , as i said , but i did n't care about any of the characters i did n't dislike the naughty ones and i found alice to be a bit insipid of course , she was meant to be insipid , and phillips did a good job of portraying that i read most of this book months ago , put the book down when i got bored , and picked it back up again recently normally with how bored i was by the book , i 'd give it three snowflakes , but i 'll give it an extra half a snowflake for humor
