i know , i am at it again i am trying to figure out if i caught a bug or if it 's just the chronic fatigue acting up initially i thought it was the cf that has been flaring over the last few days dry throat in the morning , weakness , extra tired , more pain all around mild fever very mild migraines yup sounds about right , sounds like cfs acting up even though the fibromyalgia is pretty much always there , the cfs tends to come in spurts lasting from a few days to several months i am always a little afraid when i get a spurt as i do n't know how long it will last i keep hoping for a short spurt as going to work everyday , even at a relatively easy job like mine is very difficult during these times my life winds up being a variation of the last week last week , by wednesday , i could barely function by the time i got home forget about cooking or cleaning forget also about reading or playing my computer games , these were also at a bare minimum i could just plop on the couch until it was time to go to bed the weekend was just resting and napping , again as little cleaning and cooking as possible going up and down the stairs was almost impossible so i have been thinking that i have hit a cfs flare this morning , looking at my son 's flushed face , i started doubting this theory of mine maybe it 's just a bug ? if it 's a bug , chances are it 's almost over maybe it 's not my attempt at exercising more last week and the weekend before maybe it 's just a cold without sneezing or coughing or clogged sinuses it could be right ? pretty bad when the concept of a regular cold cheers one up , but there you have it i am hoping this is just a cold thanks for reading you might also like very sick kitten and other stuff exercising for mood and health purging linkwithin
