hi ! well i am half way through my second week of sick leave hard to believe since i ca n't honestly say i have done very much except waste too much money it scares me how i will manage once the regular paycheck stops and i start getting only ei the two week without anything scares me even more i know i 'll have food to last me for weeks might not be great food by the th week but we will have food , i just do n't know how my bills will get paid you are probably figuring that this added stress is not going to help my anxiety , depression or blood pressure you are probably right the last two weeks i have not been sleeping well at all , and have been in considerable pain pretty much why i have not done much around the house i have a pile of clean laundry getting more and more wrinkled by the day they need to be folded i have cut down my tomato plants the sweet millions plant had taken over the whole garden and part of the back yard i did harvest the last of the tomatoes i of course had other tomato plants in there i did wash the laundry , folded some , just not all i did cook thanksgiving dinner yams , butternut , mashed potatoes , turkey , ham , chocolate muffins i had forgotten dessert ! i have tried cleaning the house , did the basement washroom the cleaning is just not working out very well if anything , it looks like the house is dirtier i have read a book i have gotten a lot of bad news still having issues with wind , my son 's bike was stolen , my son flipped , telus sent me a cancellation bill for canceling at the end of my contract stoopid ! my daughter 's student loans expect her to repay even though she applied for loans for this year and got them and confirmed her enrollment i have not decorated for halloween yet i have not painted anything yet i have not organized anything yet other than thanksgiving dinner i have not done much cooking or baking so obviously no miracles i have done a lot of thinking not much of it good i am afraid i have asked myself why someone whose iq is at the th percentile feels so stupid and inadequate all the time why i am embarrassed by everything i say and do , yet ca n't seem to stop the idiocities from spilling out i have asked myself why it is always so much easier to believe when people tell me i am bad things but i am always suspicious when they make a compliment , assuming they are pretending , trying to make me feel better with lies or that they are really making fun of me , how gullible i am to think they might mean it i have asked myself why i ca n't enjoy the moment , why i am always so negative , so worthless i have asked myself also why tricks that work in making other people better fail so miserably with me i have read some self help books , watched doctor phil , doctor oz and a few other health shows and wonder why the stuff they talk about seem to be such a huge revelation for the audience when my reaction is well duh how could they not know that ? i was telling my daughter that drinking specialty coffees was like drinking a pure milkshake , with cream even a double double is too much fat and sugar shortly later the host says the exact same thing and the audience is shocked ! yet people believe that i am fat because i do not know what is fatning i know the things that are fatning and bad for me i know what portions i am supposed to eat my being fat has more to do with the reasons why i eat , the reasons why i do n't exercise as much as i need and the reasons why i choose unhealthy choices over healthy ones the neuropshychologist said i do n't believe i can be helped he is definitely right he says i have trouble trusting a therapist , he is also right on that one those who may be able to help me i ca n't afford , hell i ca n't afford the ones who ca n't where does that leave me ? i 'll be going back to work without anything resolved , only to keep getting worst that 's where things leave me oh and i hate my house more and more every single day god i was such an idiot to think i could pick a decent house
