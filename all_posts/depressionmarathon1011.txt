ahhh june driving home at pm tonight , the western sky was still a subtle , golden orange this is one beauty of living so far north we may suffer through the darkness of winter , but june brings the longest days , and therefore more light , than any other time of year long days begin with first light around am and do n't end until , well , apparently after pm driving home under tonight 's still glowing sky reminded me how grateful i am for the light i 've never been diagnosed with seasonal affective disorder sad , but my brighter mood over the past couple of brighter months makes me wonder i definitely have been feeling better than i ever did over the long , dark winter , and this is n't the first year i 've noticed that fact i frequently use a sad light in the winter , but there seems to be no substitute for good 'ole sunshine i 'll be celebrating june 's long days , and hopefully my better mood , until at least june st the day the darkness begins settling in again
