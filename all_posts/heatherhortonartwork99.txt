nature is not only all that is visible to the eye it also includes the inner pictures of the soul edvard munch this past friday my good friend melissa and i went out for a hike in the dundas valley conservation area this conservation area boasts kms of trails and is home to a wide variety of wildlife this green swath has some beautiful trails in it and is frequented by all types of people , bikers , hikers , runners , you name it melissa and i figured that a hike through this peaceful place would provide more stimulation to the senses than perhaps a brisk walk through the suburbs melissa and i love to get exercise and explore while we catch up with one another and enjoy each other 's company i know that the ancient philosophers loved to walk while expounding on morals , ethics and the like i think that when we engage our bodies we engage our minds something happens that facilitates ideas and thoughts it is as though through moving the body we give our minds extra oxygen and stimulate it to knit together ideas and thoughts with greater facility have you experienced this too ? there seems to sometimes , but not always , be a slight mental stagnation if you are sitting in a static way while trying to engage in dynamic conversation or brainstorm it can be done , but i find it easier when one is on the move , hearing leaves crunch underfoot , watch the sunlight hit the ground in patches below the fir trees these moments an observations of beauty are noted and perhaps give rise to other thoughts of beauty or understanding that might have been elusive beforehand melissa choosing our route we chose a route that had us hiking for just over an hour as i had to be somewhere else afterwards and melissa had to get home as well we began our hike along sulphur creek trail and hiked up to groundhog hill with a great view of the surrounding area and a bit of the city of dundas beyond although we had only walked minutes to the trails it was as though we stepped into another world , a world of naked curtains of tree trunks , patches of sun , intermittent mud , tracks made by horses and cyclists and always the near far melodies of birds feeling the promise of spring so very close the best part of this excursion was simply how near we could find in nature and yet how far away it felt too that brief window of connection to the subtler nuances of the crack of a branch , the passing breeze , the transformation of the ground into newness and greenery , it serves to help give us balance in a world filled with clocks and deadlines , linear processes and the ennui that can come with a predictability of pace i enjoyed getting muddy and scrambling down a few slopes , hanging on to branches and focusing on the task ahead , not falling , and the rest of the world dropped away during these moments plus , talking with melissa is always wonderful , from grouting to portaging , our talks are always a treat melissa can change her own break pads and catalytic converter in her car she can do any home renovation pretty much and has a great personality in that she loves taking care of the things and people that she holds dear to her she is a true friend , like a sister that i never had in many ways she 's selfless and she gets things done period nothing stops her when she sets her mind to it , and this resolve is a powerful thing she is a doer , compassionate and one of a kind ! heading along sulphur creek trail the trails were quiet , muddy in parts , but dry on the whole it is that time of year now where hints of future explosions of fecundity are just around the corner i like doing paintings when there are few leaves on trees i find their simple , almost eerie forms devoid of foliage fun to paint the muted colours form a natural palette with variations of greys and browns that contrast nicely with a splash of colour that a person might be wearing compared to the circus of colour that we find in june and july , the spring months , with their gales , rain and cool days serve as a catalyst that brings about the warmth and heat of the later summer these transitions are quiet sometimes , but they are always happening , every day of every hour , there is a quiet growth of a slow drifting into torpor , the hypnosis of sleep overtaking the small and large creatures of scale and fur who then stretch sleepily months later , these being that call this beautiful place their home are just as cyclical in spirit as the trees that they climb it is the great concert of life that we can be a part of , revel in and respect as we continued along we encountered a small fleet of deer who eyed us cautiously , blending into the dun coloured backdrop of their home but then scattered in a flurry of white tails we watched them bound away like things possessed and then continued on to groundhog hill perfectly still and well hidden , this deer is one of many that live in the conservation area we stood atop the hill for a few minutes , enough to notice flies everywhere , buzzing near the ground in some sort of purpose that only they knew about we scanned the horizon and noticed the water tower in dundas off to the right , a familiar landmark on the skyline in the area we saw that someone had dedicated a bench there to a family member who had valued nature conservancy , a lovely reminder in that place of the vast number of people who cherish the natural world and seek to protect it we made our way back to the entrance to the trails and then , seemingly out of nowhere , we were once again in the subdivision where melissa lives a strange contrast to be walking almost anonymously through the trees and then you suddenly find yourself walking by driveways and houses , kids playing and traffic rolling by the fact that these two environments exist very close together there in dundas helps me to appreciate how quickly one can feel so far away from it all in a few minutes you can find yourself alone with your thoughts , or sharing them with a good friend i am continuing with my paintings for the newfoundland show of pieces have sold already so that is just amazing i am so grateful that the work moves people so much who could ask for more than that ? to have your work , your passion , move someone in a small way or in a profound one , is magical i am thankful that my work might be able to do this i cherish that and hope to be able to do this for the rest of my life ! we simply need that wild country available to us , even if we never do more than drive to its edge and look in for it can be a means of reassuring ourselves of our sanity as creatures , a part of the geography of hope wallace stegner here is some information on the exhibition in november of i hope to see you there !
