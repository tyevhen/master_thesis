i'm not feeling quite so popular today over on the baltimore sun 's website , clink and i have an op ed piece talking about our views on medical marijuana ah , most of the commenters do n't agree with us , and while many of the remarks are thoughtful , many are n't does smoking weed interfere with the ability to spell ? i got one phone call from a gentleman no name , blocked number telling me i need my head examined , that marijuana is the safest substance known to man , i should n't be popping my mouth off and i know nothing okay , so i know what i'm going to write about for our clinical psychiatry news blog this week my favorite comment might be who are apprantly psychiatrists make sure next time you disclose the sources of your income for us big pharma also , how many patients would you lose if pot were lagal and you did n't have to prescribe prozac every day ? ? ? marijuana is plant and should not be regulated like drugs at all drugs kill drugs are dangerous marijuana is not on a lighter note , we talked at suburban hospital on thursday evening over people showed up on a week night , at pm , no less to hear a bunch of psychiatrists ! it went well from what i could tell , lots of questions , very few people ran out of the auditorium screaming i felt very honored that so many people would come out to hear us i did want to share with you that part of clink 's talk was to read some of the comments we got on the post what is bipolar disorder ? i 've given talks with clink a number of times now , but i did n't know she was going to do this and her reading of the comments was moving sarebear , if you 're reading this , i wanted you to know that when she was reading your description of bipolar disorder , i was thinking that you need to become a writer other posts on marijuana
