in conversation recently , someone said to me they do n't think that most men realize to what lengths women are expected to go to look pretty i think that person is right i also think many women do n't think much about all the things they 're expected to do to look pretty for the most part , those things are just accepted normal just what you do and it harms us physically and emotionally physically , the average woman is exposed to a huge amount of chemicals on a daily basis the facial cleansers , body creams , lip balms , makeup , deodorant , hairspray , perfume all of these except for a very few natural brands that actually do n't contain any harmful chemicals are loaded with carcinogens and other harmful chemicals yet if a woman , or even more so , a teenage girl , does n't wear makeup she 's often considered a freak for fear of being ostracized , for fear of weird looks , most women shave most women wear a bra most women wear makeup and most women would never even consider not doing any of these things ! ! if they 're freely chosen , none of these things are bad with the exclusion of cosmetics and body care products containing harmful ingredients but as the only option , the only way you 'll be considered attractive or so people think , i think it 's absolutely horrible why ca n't people see that breasts are not , actually , bra shaped , and that they move when you move ? why ca n't people see that all humans have hair all over their bodies , not just the parts currently considered socially acceptable ? why ca n't people see what a beautiful face looks like without a heavy coating of makeup ? i went through a stage , in my mid teens , where i felt so different , so out of place , and i was desperate to fit in so , casting off my hippie upbringing , i bought bras , and shaved my legs , and even after a while started wearing makeup i got to the point where i 'd usually put makeup on before leaving the house , and if i was n't wearing any , i 'd look in the mirror and think i looked ugly that 's what kind of snapped me out of it , along with my new findings about just how dangerous many chemicals in cosmetics are i did n't want to get cancer and i knew that i should not think that the only true beauty was from synthetic gunk on my face that also coincided with a definite movement in my life towards finding myself creating my own identity , being my own person this involved , and involves , a steady movement to a more hippie ish , more organic , and less constrained by social mores , existence so i 've become part of the bras and razors are optional club want to join me ? really , why must i change my body , constrain myself in weird and uncomfortable undergarments , or endanger my health by absorbing harmful chemicals into my skin , to fit into some version of beauty i neither accept nor support ? i guess you could say i'm in the process of detoxing from the expectations of this culture in both this area of my life , and in many others it 's a long process , and often a difficult one , to break away from the expectations of your entire culture but i think it 's a very healthy , very good thing to be doing peace , idzie you might also like you want to know what makes me mad ? earth day cuddly cats and problems with life goals green anarchy linkwithin
