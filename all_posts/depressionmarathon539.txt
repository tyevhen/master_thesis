as we say here in minnesota , uff da ! it was another tough day out there on the roads as predicted , the weather was not conducive to running a good marathon yesterday the temp at the start was reasonable , but the sun came out from behind the clouds just as the starter fired his pistol the temperature began its precipitous climb by the time i finished , the temperature was nearing degrees in addition , winds averaging miles per hour throughout the race made for a tough , tough day i began the day with what i thought was a reasonable goal i wanted to run somewhere around a hours , minutes to do that , i needed to average minutes and seconds per mile fortunately , there was a pace group , so i jumped in with them at the start unfortunately , of my first miles were well below pace the pacer , it seemed , went out way too fast and rather than trusting my watch , not to mention how i felt , i went with him dumb going out too fast it is the cardinal sin of marathoning i know better despite knowing better , my ego got the best of me i somehow convinced myself i could handle the early pace on a day when i should have started extra slow , i huffed and puffed up and down the hills over the first seven miles i hoped i could handle it , but in the back of my mind i knew i was likely going to pay i felt a little emboldened when the course flattened out around mile eight , and we the pace group and i ran a nice steady pace for the next several miles i saw my mom and friends at mile i told them i started too fast they told me i looked great i hung with the ever shrinking pace group as long as i could , hoping at least to make it to miles with them but i faded fast , and at mile i screeched to a halt and began to walk it happened that fast , and it lasted the rest of the race i walked a little , ran a little , walked a little more , ran a little less it was hot it was windy and i started too fast no matter what i put into my body , and i put in a lot , it was n't enough to refuel me it was a classic crash ! so it was a long day i focused on finishing i focused on taking just one more step i thought about you readers cheering me on i thought about what i 'd write in this post , what lessons could i impart from such a frustrating day and the lessons are these trust your instincts know you know what you know , and stick to your plan finally , when you make a mistake , it 's not the end of the world and by no means is it a reason to quit by putting one foot in front of the other sometimes quickly , sometimes slowly i did finish in ish and i am wiser because of it hopefully , i wo n't repeat the same mistakes again
