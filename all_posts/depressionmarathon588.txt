it 's been a couple of really tough days here my mood is again in the toilet , and i'm still in the hospital the current plan is to dismiss friday after ect i feel like i 've been here forever , yet i'm still so low i'm worried and scared right now i 've had ect treatments with little to show for it my mood does n't seem to be responding , and that drags me further down the darkened path i 've been very tearful and sad i spoke with my regular psychiatrist last night both she and my social worker recall that i did n't respond well last spring , either , until i had the th and th treatments i hope they are correct it 's the only hope i have to hang onto right now hope is hard to come by i 've not had the energy to get on the bike or treadmill for a few days i'm trying to be okay with that focus on healing one thing at a time , i say but i do feel better if i move my body , so i may try some gentle spinning tonight i hope the days are long and dark right now i'm saying my serenity prayer and asking god to take away the pain while shining a little light into my soul as i see it , if ect wo n't work , divine intervention is the only option remaining i'm hanging in there , but i'm tired i need a way out soon
