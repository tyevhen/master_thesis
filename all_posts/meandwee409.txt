hi friends ! today we got to enjoy a bit of extra warm weather ! it 's supposed to go back to being chilly tomorrow , so we took advantage and spent much of the afternoon playing on the lawn outside our house the leaves are at peak foliage so paige was captivated with the treetops i had to throw in a photo of maren snuggling with her beloved rubber bone it used to be covered in tennis ball fuzz , but she ripped it all off i think she 'd marry this toy if she could but she settles for snuggling it in the evenings i was happy to finally capture a photo of it ! save
