a few days ago , ghostproxies com came up with an interesting infographic showing some stats on internet and social web fakery click to enlarge via ghostproxies com wsj found that of internet visitors are non human , with the implication that around a third of the billion spent annually on internet ads might be wasted however , it should be noted that large advertisers like verizon routinely write riders into their ad contracts , giving them the right to rebates or make goods on phony traffic both twitter and instagram have maintained that they believe fake accounts to be only of total logged in users the above infographic suggests the number might be closer to however , even that 's probably way too conservative when instagram famously undertook a purge of spam accounts across the site last december , instagram 's own account shrank almost overnight from the new york times various apps exist online for estimating the number of fake twitter accounts associated with a given user when i ran a check on dickc the account of dick costolo , ceo of twitter at https www twitteraudit com dickc , i found his followers to be good , with inactive or fake another tool i used came up with even worse results many large accounts have substantial zombie followings , of course but what does it say when almost all large accounts turn out to be to bots and zombies ? twitter is almost certainly more than bogus accounts at this point , but the company refuses to resolve the controversy , which it could and should do , immediately , by allowing an independent auditing firm access to the data when a bigtime auditing firm finally does get to see what 's going on , we 'll probably learn that the spammer symantec recently said created , twitter accounts was not an isolated incident many thousands of such spammers are no doubt creating tens or hundreds of millions of accounts in automated fashion it 's out of control and twitter management wo n't come clean , because they know the truth will be devastating to twitter 's stock price and its ad business in the magazine world , publishers have been kept honest relatively so , at least for years by organizations like the audit bureau of circulations recently , the american association of advertising agencies and interactive advertising bureau put together what they 're calling the trustworthy accountability group , an opt in auditing service via which online media outlets will be able to certify their purity it 's still in the planning stages my reading of the ad age story on this is that the tag effort is well intentioned and moving in the right direction , but also underfunded and greatly underestimates the difficulty of measuring never mind mitigating click fraud , referrer spam , legitimate versus fraudulent bot traffic , phony social media accounts , etc it 's not clear to me , for example , how tag will induce a social media giant like twitter which has consistently misrepresented its user numbers , claiming fake users when everyone knows the real number is much higher to come clean if it does n't want to possibly the sec should step in ? twitter 's dissimulations border on fraud , at this point but hey we have to start somewhere if tag can live up to its mandate , the internet may yet become a safer place to spend advetising dollars right now , it 's the wild west and that is n't always such a convivial place , especially if you 're a little guy have you checked out my free book mental health myths debunked ? tons of info , tons of live links , lots of straight talk about depression , meds , therapy , psychiatry , mental health trends , statistics , and more and you know me , i call bullshit on bogus ideas then give urls to the actual data the idea that antidepressants take weeks to do anything ? myth most people benefit from antidepressants ? myth antidepressants separate from placebo in clinical trials ? largely myth half the trials show separation half do n't electroshock therapy is safe and effective ? bigtime myth ect is dangerous and consent forms lie but do n't take my word for it read the science for yourself it 's all laid out with references in the book download epub or pdf now at noisetrade tell a friend i want to thank the following great folks who retweeted me yesterday on twitter my advice ? follow these guys they retweet ! have you added your name to our mailing list ? also please visit hackyourdepression com when you have a chance , and share that link with someone you know who might be suffering from anxiety or depression
