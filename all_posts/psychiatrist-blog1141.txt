when i was growing up , cigarettes were something people bought from vending machines i 've never been a smoker , but i want to say they cost about a dollar ? i'm not so sure , and it 's not something i pay much attention to today , i learned that a carton of cigarettes cost ! a pack , or cents a cigarette so someone who smokes packs day , pays about a month the funny thing is , i did n't know this because people never complain to me about the cost of cigarettes they complain about the cost of medicines this sometimes includes patients with medicaid who have a co pay for their meds , the cost of health insurance , and the cost of medical treatment at times , i 've suggested that patients with heavy habits cut down by one pack a month so less than a cigarette a day to be able to afford their medicines and i 've been met with groans do i think cigarettes should cost this much ? yes the health problems they cause and the cost they inflict on society is so huge , that i believe they should be heavily taxed and the monies should go to medical expenses incurred by smokers and research on how to better prevent addictions my personal rant , added at no additional cost but i think it speaks to power of their addiction that people are willing to put out this huge sum of money on cigarettes people who do n't have it , people who really ca n't afford it , people who would go without necessary medical insurance or medical care , meals at nice restaurants , vacations , and many other things that , a year would buy so why is this a shrink rap post ? patients with severe and persistent mental illnesses have higher rates of smoking than the population as a whole , and they also die a lot younger , often from cardiovascular disease check out this post on psych central
