here 's an aspect of shooter psychology you do n't often hear about it 's from an article written by the mother of dylan klebold , one of the columbine killers it 's hard to imagine how one 's child could do something so horrific , harder still to imagine that a shooter could keep his plans so well hidden even from those who knew him best he was a bright child with few previous problems certainly fewer problems than the tucson shooter and less evidence of mental illness how did things go wrong ? in her own words those of us who cared for dylan felt responsible for his death we thought , if i had been a better mother , father , brother , friend , aunt , uncle , cousin , i would have known this was coming we perceived his actions to be our failure i tried to identify a pivotal event in his upbringing that could account for his anger had i been too strict ? not strict enough ? had i pushed too hard , or not hard enough ? in the days before he died , i had hugged him and told him how much i loved him i held his scratchy face between my palms and told him that he was a wonderful person and that i was proud of him had he felt pressured by this ? did he feel that he could not live up to my expectations ? it 's hard enough being a parent , wondering if you 're doing things 'right' or 'good enough' , even you 're kid is n't a spree killer the parents of the tucson shooter are probably asking the same questions
