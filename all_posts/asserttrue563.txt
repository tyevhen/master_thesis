the ink is mostly faded now , but my mad money bull is signed by jim cramer screenwriter william goldman best known for butch cassidy the sundance kid once famously said of hollywood nobody knows anything i'm here to tell you that the same is true , only more so , for wall street do n't be misled there are only two people i trust when it comes to investment advice jim cramer , and myself and there are times when i do n't trust either one how 's that for paranoia ? here 's the truth about investing no matter what you invest in , knowing what you 're doing means understanding markets and almost nobody understands markets , because to understand markets you have to be able to wrap your head around why people do the weird things they do when they 're in the grip of greed , fear , and desperation and so , a good first book in investing would be charles mackay 's classic , extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds pdf copy available free here the second book you should read for pure entertainment value , if nothing else is jim cramer 's autobiographical confessions of a street addict if you 're a writer or journalism student , be sure to read this book cramer started out as a journalist , covering the crime beat for the tallahassee democrat , where he covered the ted bundy murders he later worked for the derelict and decrepit los angeles herald examiner before it went under , where he eventually got tired of being poor he was living out of his car after being robbed twice and thus applied to and got into harvard law the rest of cramer 's incredible story , you 'll have to read for yourself if you read only one of cramer 's books , though , make sure it 's this one cramer is far from infallible but he 's the smartest guy on wall street , and the one guy i 'd seldom want to bet against i 've learned a ton from him i 've also learned a ton from practical experience over the years , i 've traded gold futures , cotton futures , lumber futures i 've traded stocks and options i 've wandered into markets i had no business being in in , i did something like million in trades on a k account yes , lots and lots of small trades , largely because i was on a continuous dopamine high induced by a yale trained quack who had me taking a cocktail of pharmaceuticals that made me as manic as richard simmons on crystal meth i 've made money , i 've lost money , i 've done all kinds of stupid things and i 'll do more stupid things just not the same ones as before the reason i'm writing this is because i actually think i'm a pretty decent investor at this point , and i think i can make you one , too , in about minutes or at the very least , i can keep you from making some very awful mistakes so listen up the first thing you need to do to educate yourself about markets is learn to distrust every market expert you come across myself included and just spend some time watching markets in action turn on cnbc and mute the volume watch the ticker for a few days , do a lot of chart watching on google finance , get a feel for what kind of mass hysteria is popular at the moment if you have one of those lousy company sponsored k plans that only lets you choose between this or that mutual fund , roll that thing into an ira and begin to manage it yourself do some actual investing mutual funds are crap , your k plan administrator is making tons of money off them so is your employer , you need to get out of them buy actual stocks yourself let me cut the suspense and get right to my investing strategy , which really comes down to just a few very simple rules rule no buy low , sell high do n't laugh that 's your ultimate goal that 's your guiding principle that 's job one always keep it in mind how to put that into action ? very simple rule no on market up days , look for opportunities to sell on market down days , look for opportunities to buy buy on down days , sell on up days how else were you planning to buy low , sell high ? most people are bad at following this rule people see stocks going up day after day during a rally , and they figure why not jump in for the ride ? wrong , wrong , wrong do n't buy when prices are going up chances are , you 're near a top when you turn on cnbc in the morning and you see that the markets are going to open to the up side , you should be thinking hmm , i wonder what i should sell today ? not what should i buy today ? rule no diversify own at least stocks , in entirely different sectors do n't own more than stocks if you do , you 're just running your own mutual fund you might as well trade the major average indexes rule no own some gold every portfolio , without exception , needs to have some gold in it gold is the one thing that will be up when the rest of the market is down or when war breaks out with iran , or whatever do n't buy futures and do n't buy mining companies buy the actual metal i recommend you just take a position in gld that 's the simplest , safest way to get in and out of gold buy on down days hold forever rule no go for quality do n't go crazy buying crappy speculative bullshit flash in the pan stocks i agree with cramer that every investor should probably own at least one speculative stock , at some point at the moment , cramer seems to think highly of hek i think he 's nuts but on the whole , you should n't buy stocks that have crazy out of whack p e ratios or that you have faint misgivings about , etc you want to be able to sleep at night that means owning rock solid companies , preferably ones that pay a dividend ge , ibm , boeing , mcdonalds , whatever they do n't have to be dow stocks they just have to be quality stocks , companies with a good longterm story that are profitable , have been around a while , and will be around for a good while longer rule no always , always , always buy with conviction if you ca n't look at the stock you 're about to buy and say to yourself i have absolute , utter conviction in the quality and longterm outlook for this stock , do n't buy it you should have so much conviction in what you 're buying that if it immediately goes down , right after you bought it , you simply buy more because you 're now able to get it at a bargain price if you felt boeing was a good buy at , consider it an even better buy if it suddenly goes to ! and remember , you 'll feel much better about that down stock if it 's paying you a dividend while you wait out the up side rule no do n't fight market momentum there will be days when the entire market seems like it 's acting crazy because it is markets are sometimes pathological things go up that should n't go up things go down that should n't go down be ready for it , and accept it as part of the game that 's a lot easier to do if you stick to rule no , above rule no decide in advance how long you 're willing to stay with a position and approximately at what price points you 're willing to get out for example , i happen to believe ibm will go to sometime in the next year if i buy it , i have to be willing to sit on it for a year to see if i'm right i do n't currently own any ibm , by the way rule no do n't forget the big picture it 's a global market you have to factor global business conditions and currency fluctuations into your strategy for example , some people think agriculture is a major longterm play because of all the hungry people in the world and some people think a tractor company like deere is a good way to play it that may well be , but if you believe as i do that the dollar will be strong for the first half of this year , you may well want to consider kubota instead of deere , since the yen is weak and the world 's tractor buyers may well want to pay for tractors using a comparatively much stronger currency rule no do your homework but do n't fixate on it in other words , yes , you should know something about a company before you buy its stock , and the more you know , the better but do n't kid yourself into thinking that markets are all about metrics and stats and knowledge and information they 're largely about fear and greed and stupidity and venality the best researched investment will often turn sour for no good reason if you do n't believe it , just look at the performance of professional mutual fund managers , which tends to suck bigtime would i say that is going to be a good year for buying stocks ? yes in general , i think this will be a stellar year for u s stocks but you have to be picky some obvious standouts include boeing with its huge order backlog and apple which is headed for within the next months i do n't currently own any boeing or apple , because they seem a tad overbought right now i'm waiting for a decent pullback before investing in such obvious winners last month , i did well with oracle which i bought on december when it took a huge fall based on a disappointing earnings announcement , then sold last week after a runup i also did well with ibm , which i bought around , then again around , and sold the minute they released good earnings results and shot up a share i did n't do so well with webmd , which i bought the day of its calamitous decline when the ceo left , thinking it would go up quickly i got impatient and closed out that position at a share loss a bit prematurely if aapl falls after its jan earnings announcement , i 'll probably buy some at that point right now , still seems a bit pricey it 's probably the best stock there is or ever was , though i feel like a damned fool for not owning any boo hoo ya
