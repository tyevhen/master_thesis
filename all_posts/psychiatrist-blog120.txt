novelist and psychoanalyst lisa gornick has an article in today 's nytime opinionator , why i never write about my patients she talks about how she ended her career as a psychoanalyst when her novels became successful first a leave of absence , then the separation became a divorce gornick writes during the years when my stories appeared only in obscure literary journals , never seen by any of my patients , the marriage between my occupations was comfortable with the publicity that accompanied the publication of my first novel , in , however , many patients became aware of my writing i knew that whatever responses they might have were grist for the therapy mill , but i also knew that just as dreams are transformations of the unconscious of the dreamer , literary works plumb their authors inner lives analytically oriented therapists such as myself use our responses in sessions as a way of understanding our patients in a sense , lending our unconscious for the purposes of the treatment but adding my patients responses to my novel into the mix having my characters , with their links to other corners of my unconscious , in the treatment room risked , i feared , both clogging the therapeutic mill with too much grist and inhibiting my writing work out of concern for its impact on my patients i stopped taking new patients , gave my current patients months notice sufficient time for nearly all to complete their treatment and commenced an extended leave eight years later , i tested the waters for returning to my practice only to discover that the separation should be a divorce with many of my stories and essays and interviews now available online , and with new mores in which there is no hesitation about looking up anything about anyone , i felt too exposed i'm not one for writing about my own patients , it just does n't seem either necessary or right , so i can relate to gornick 's concerns but when it comes to the analytic belief that the psychoanalyst must be a blank slate whose personal life remains hidden from the patient , then i drift off times have changed and it 's hard to remain obscure i like social media , and the internet makes us all so much more more exposed than we 'd like to be it takes a rare person to ward off every activity that might show up online when i think about it , i feel smothered in the office , i'm mostly me , but modified to meet the needs of my patients in my free time , i'm all me and fortunately the 'me' who lets loose has no criminal convictions
