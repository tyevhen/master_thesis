hi friends ! i'm sorry we 've been missing from this space ! we 've been sick with a horrible cold and it 's still hanging on blech i thought , in the meantime , i would update you with some follow ups from earlier posts ! i 'd mentioned just a few posts ago about my watercolor class it 's so fun ! i just had my third class last night and we did a color version of the monochromatic painting i posted about before here are my paintings together as you can see , i made a few changes to the color version and i like the composition much better it did n't take much time to make the painting since the teacher was guiding us through steps to complete it also , a few posts ago i 'd mentioned our apple picking trip and my desire to make an apple pie well , i did it ! and it was delicious of course , i scoured the internet and picked a recipe that was very involved for a first timer but it was well worth the extra effort ! you can find the recipe i used here do n't i look excited ? hee ! i did n't make the crust myself that was a pillsbury pre made one and it was great ! and , just because , i thought i 'd show this amusing photo of chris doing his best paige impression save
