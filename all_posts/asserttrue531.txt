f a cockpit expand your mental image of what a device is , for a moment i'm sure you 'd be willing to agree that a fighter jet is an extremely complex , high functionality device yet it has to have a usable human interface or else it 's not worth much how does one provide a highly usable interface for such a complex device ? in the s , the way to do it was as shown in the accompanying photo of the cockpit of a general dynamics f a you do n't have to be a pilot to appreciate the fact that the user interface to the f a was let us say intimidating in its complexity is such an interface usable ? apparently it was over of these aircraft flew , with the cockpit design shown in the photo f raptor cockpit fast forward to , which is when the lockheed martin boeing f raptor went into service the f a has a useful load max weight minus empty weight of about , pounds , which is essentially the same as for the f a in almost all other respects , the planes are miles apart the f a has vastly greater capabilities than the f a so much so , that the two airplanes should n't really be compared but the point is , the f , despite being a much more sophisticated and capable aircraft than the f a , has a much simpler human interface see photo what happened between and ? human factors research happened first , human factors experts realized that anything that could be considered a visual distraction is a potential safety hazard therefore , consolidate and hide , if you can as many doodads as possible naturally , the advent of processor driven electronics made it possible to integrate and automate many of the functions that were previously exposed to crew , thus reducing the overall interface footprint a good example is fully automated digital engine control fadec technology in the f a , pilots had to monitor half a dozen engine gauges showing turbine inlet temperature and other indications of engine status in a modern jet , a computer monitors and regulates such things the pilot does n't need to get involved an important feature of modern cockpits which has little or nothing to do with technology per se is that important items in the interface e g display screens are made larger than less important elements human factors experts quickly realized that the worst possible thing to do is simply make all gauges or groups of gauges a standard size regardless of importance advances in digital display technology made it possible to consolidate data from multiple gauges onto one display surface which might have several display modes this also reduces footprint , even though the biggest gauges which are now screens have actually gotten bigger yet another outcome of human factors research was is that color displays are easier for the brain to parse than a wall of black and white data likewise , graphical visualizations of data if done correctly are easier to comprehend than numeric representations the overall principle at work is , of course , that of simplification combined with functional organization to fly an aircraft , the pilot needs to have flight information airspeed , altitude , rate of climb or descent , angle of bank and or rate of turn , heading , navigational information terrain information , aircraft position , some indication of desired course and deviation from desired course , distance to waypoint , and the ability to operate avionics avionics include radios used for communication transponders to make the aircraft show up on ground radar navigational receivers , such as gps , and aids to navigating the glidepath to a landing weather avoidance gear and autopilots in a military aircraft , the only major additional functional group is the fire control weapons management system so in other words , the major functional groups are few in number they include flight information navigational information avionics and fire control within each of these groups , you apply the standard principles of consolidation , appropriate visualization , and size differentiation important things bigger , less important things smaller all of these principles can be adapted to gui intensive software it 's up to you and your human factors experts to decide how
