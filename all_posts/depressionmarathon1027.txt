it was a gorgeous day for a race almost perfect conditions met us throughout our miles , and i ran fast ! ! in my earlier post i hoped for a which would have meant averaging per mile i ended up running a ! that 's per mile , and that 's the first time in the last years that i 've gone under minutes per mile on any course longer than k prior to years ago , a would have been slow for me , but today it was thrilling my time , however , was not the most thrilling aspect of the day i felt good early , and i felt great later in the race that was really exciting ! it felt like a breakthrough race in fact , i felt like a runner again perhaps the decision not to wear my watch during the race contributed to feeling great i think it did it was a big decision i always wear a watch i always wear a watch that beeps and gives me my split time at every mile going without my watch is far from typical , but it just felt right today without my watch i had to run on feel alone i battled the anxiety of my naked wrist for the first couple miles i battled worry thoughts about running too fast , running too slow , getting passed , not getting passed you name it i worried about it until about mile three well those thoughts pissed me off , as i knew i was feeling good and felt i was running fast so somewhere between miles and i settled into a positive mantra and pushed the worry thoughts out that helped the turn around found me smack in the middle of men and women we had been exchanging positions throughout by mile , however , i was almost alone i do n't know what happened i do n't know how fast i was going , but i just took off i definitely ran faster over the second half of the race it was a bit surreal and it was fun i had fun this was one of those good days that pop up every once in awhile in running thanks , god , i needed this one !
