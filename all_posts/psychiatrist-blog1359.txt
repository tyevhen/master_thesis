my nephew wants to be a doctor specifically , a psychiatrist what could i say ? i'm biased , but i think it 's a great choice the world of medicine is pretty challenging these days and a doctor 's lifestyle in training can be a grind , but if i had to do it over again i 'd do the same thing he 's looking for a chance to get some additional research experience while he applies to grad school , so i agreed to put up a blurb for him if anybody knows how he can do some interesting psych related research in the berkeley area or online , for free or for pay , please comment here or drop an email here 's what he has to say for himself hello , world ! this is the clinkshrink 's nephew , of roughly the same level of nerdiness but sans guinea pig obsession i recently graduated from berkeley with a degree in molecular neurobiology and one in architecture , of all things , and am currently paying off student loans working on a samhsa study dawn project and writing policy for the city of berkeley while applying for mph programs for fall i have the goal of getting an md or phd after that i'm fixed pretty firmly in berkeley for at least the next year , but would be interested in helping out for pay or volunteer in some additional research work via telecommuting clink suggested the blog could be a means of finding out about these opportunities my primary interests lie in tying emotional cognitive psychology to neurobiology , particularly where clinical treatments and disorders are involved i certainly would n't turn down other interesting psych work , though , and just in case you were curious , my dream nobel prize would come from elucidating a physiological basis for consciousness whatever that may end up meaning for the physicians out there , i'm much more interested in internal medicine and therapy treatments than surgical intervention , but again at this point i'm not ruling anything out off the bat email shrinkrapblog at gmail com or comment here if you know of any thing like this , and clink will forward the info to me cheerio , and thanksa !
