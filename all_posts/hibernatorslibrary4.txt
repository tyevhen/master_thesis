roots , by alex haley this is the epic story following the family of kunta kinte , who was kidnapped as a teenager from his home in africa to be a slave in the us his family is dramatically followed down the line to alex haley , the author there is a well known miniseries based on the book it was pretty good , as well as a newer one which i 've not seen the first one follows the book almost perfectly for the most part , this was an excellently written character driven book i enjoyed following the family down the generations unfortunately , haley ruined it by claiming that it was actually his heritage , which it was not that was a lie it was also apparently plagiarized including even some of the characters from another book knowing that took some of the admiration i would have otherwise felt for the book still , it was quite good and a good start for black history month
