i have always been different i am almost the complete opposite of the typical guy at age i am quiet , humble , smart , like different music , etc when all the others are outgoing , sporty , and average i am always worried that nothing will ever do for me and i won t be successful because of my shyness and extreme lack of confidence i don t think i m the worst looking person in the word , this one girl in particular calls me sexy i don t think of myself as that every other day , yet i have no confidence i have always felt as if as soon as i hit age or and i m out of high school , like would just automatically be better , when i have no clue what to do with my life i guess you could call it social anxiety , and it keeps me from being the person i d love to be and want to be i never imagined myself going into a job interview because i plain out don t like to socialize with people i don t know thinking i m just doing to mess up somehow everyone i encounter daily would somehow need to be my friend or be nice enough for me to be able to talk to them with ease i sorta have a fear of embarrassment , awkwardness , and denial so i just try to stay out of as much as i can i even keep long hair to hide a lot of my face if i get embarrassed i know , ridiculous what i m trying to say is that i feel like i m going to get nowhere becuase of this almost anxiety in me every day i do talk to people at school , but it s because i know them well enough or i see that they are nice i do have main best friends and a lot of other friends too , but they aren t people i can trust to explain all my thoughts to them it s like i someone i can trust to just be there all the time to guide me through life and make jokes when i fail and keep my hopes up when i m denied people are almost always nice to me with very few exceptions i feel like i could write a blog about my life just to express my thoughts i don t know , its just , that feeling nothing is going to work out call me a drama queen or whatever , i just want to know of it is an anxiety problem or just shyness in general and maybe how to overcome it when it is time for job interviews and things i need to face alone answer i have the same problems i have long hair to hide behind too well i m and i have social anxiety disorder a therapist could help , i don t like that though i d too freaked to really go i meditate and write because those things relax me so if writing a blog will help you go for it college is hard for me because i have to do everything on my own , it s better though because no one bothers you like in high school going to get job applications was horrifying but i did it and my first interview i threw up three times rinsed my mouth out and went what i find helps is actually something i got from a movie what about bob billy murray goes around saying i feel good i feel great i feel wonderful it sounds dumb but i say it and say it until i do feel better mind over matter i have panic attacks , i puke when i know i have to go places , i can t even talk to people i live with and yet i somehow make it through the day and into the next all you can do is live , the people you re afraid of won t kill you so you have time i know this is bad advise and i m sorry i just want you to know you re not alone you can email or contact me maybe since i can relate you can talk to me about stuff and maybe i could help really feel free sources hope someone helps
