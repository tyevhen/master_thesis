as i watched foamy white fingers dance across the dark green waves at the beach recently , all i could think about was time it s the one thing we all share it s the one thing we can t control and it s the one thing we can never get back as orderly and predictable as time is , none of us can predict how much we have toes pressed into the sand , i watched my children , so big and grown , play in the surf memories that made me smile and made me cry flashed through my racing mind i could see myself sitting in the sand with my daughter a toddler at the time building sand castles in that perfect spot on the beach , the smooth place where the waves slowly run out and then retreat to the water she s now i could see my middle child , who didn t like the sand much , sitting in a chair for hours with his finger in his mouth , soaking it all in while never complaining he s too big to sit in my lap now , and probably wouldn t want to anyway i could see our baby the first time we took him to the beach , when he fearlessly crawled so far into the water waves were crashing into his face before i scooped him into my arms he starts his last year of elementary school in two months time my relationship with time is stormy and complicated i resent time because i ve lost so much of it to my disease there are things i can t remember there are life experiences that run together , tormenting me because i can t remember each precious day i ve had with my family even our most recent trip to the beach is a blur in some ways , maybe because i was distracted with unexpected work and spent too much time staring at this laptop time is hard for those with serious mental illness our days of suffering feel interminable , our good days fleeting and few maybe that s normal , but i suspect it isn t my disease has caused me to miss much of life what i would do to have every one of those really bad days back to do over again when i m feeling healthy they say you should live with no regrets , never looking back i don t know why that s so hard for me to do , but it is mental illness distorts one s thinking , so i guess it only makes sense it would distort our sense of time we worry about the time in front of us , regret the time behind us and fail to appreciate the time passing by at every moment i hope those who read this don t take it as whiny discontent or juvenile bitterness i write about mental illness to help me cope , to give others hope and to help the normal among us understand what life is like inside a troubled mind i haven t written in a while , partly because i ve had longer periods of good mental health but also because i ve secretly been hoping the dragon has been slayed , never to return i fear speaking his name might rouse him from his slumber the truth is i know the dragon is out there somewhere , still waiting for me he might even be just beyond those green waves
