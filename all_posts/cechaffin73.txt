it 's been a while since i 've blogged , but that is a measure of mental health in that i do n't feel the therapeutic need to do so , even if i had a little dip in my mood in the last week , though increased medications seem to have that on the run i wo n't list my medications i 've done so in the past i do n't want anyone to think my cocktail is universal or easily applied to others these combinations of drugs are beyond psychiatry 's ability to determine if and why they work as long as you 're doing well , keep taking them in medical school in a lecture on psychosis a professor opined this is an antipsychotic , mellaril take mg a day and if you feel better , do n't tell anyone doctors are the most serious drug abusers and rns a close second availability , availability , availability but mellaril is hardly a drug of abuse as for reading , i 've plowed through a slew of novels of late , have nearly finished wallace stevens' collected poems , and am more than halfway through with john ashbery 's selected stevens is a master ashbery is a curiosity of our times , a man who shares his present , quotidian consciousness with us and often contrasts it with the past and muses on stages of development he is not a lyric poet he is not a logopoet he is a discursive poet who throws everything in but the kitchen sink in his usual pastiche of narrating his own consciousness he is boring , obtuse and self indulgent when he briefly attempts formal rhymes they are laughable had he been writing a century ago i daresay he would n't have been a poet at all back then you had to be able to master a sonnet i cannot disrecommend him more highly , but he has benefited me in loosening my associations in my own compositions earlier in this blog i attempted to encompass the whole thing here 's a link to that post the whole thing i have now worked the same thing into one of my recent poems the whole thing is a nimiety of untold proportions , a whirling globe of radishes , a carnival with a trillion barkers , a moon braying at a palm forest , a thousand eyed politician , numberless embalmers with brake fluid , the naked ballerina twirling at the speed of light like some vanishing gyroscope , how the pumpkin seeds coat everything , the evaporation of water , salt crust of a diminishing bog , carnivorous plants in a gorgon wig , the extinction of dinosaurs , the dodo holocaust , the decline of frogs , nimbus of maggots , temple of flies wound around a rubber center like a golf ball with its shiny dimples , the stainless steel contraption we dreamed of that did everything , the ultimate swiss army knife , a hoover with a million attachments for soldering and colonoscopy and carpet cleaning , the crystal hagiography of various churches spread like maps on the brown velvet and all the funny hats , funny hats in cardinal red or quaker black honoring the birdbath of their flocks , a giant gumball rolling down a farm road picking up feathers and cigar stubs and all manner of vegetables , growing monstrously large like an irradiated pumpkin but uncontainable , incontestable , always in motion while accreting substance of sand , shells , gravel , straw , burrs stuck to its expanding surface like hemagglutinin spikes on a virus , a thing of absolute obesity gobbling souls like popcorn while film coils around film into the ultimate movie , a chambered nautilus of action figures , special effects and nausea , the smell of charred spaceships mixed with chanel no , bubbling green alien flesh on no earthly channel rather broadcast to us by them who overpopulate the periphery of the humongous outbreak of potentiality that attracts everything , having more gravity than anything , an all absorbent ball of paper towels , a thing without tonsils or teeth that absorbs us through its porous skin as a frog does oxygen , a sticky thing , a caramel apple of prodigious girth , taking the shape of a sphere because it is the most economical though it cares nothing about economy as it eclipses the global gdp in its relentless overbearing on everything at once , pressing down on the collective forehead , depressing eyes with fishing weights , insatiable superplanet sucking up moons like plankton , the whole pelican s beak but already molting beyond that , plastered about with hummingbird wings like bumper stickers , the whole damn indefinable mess of it , an all encompassing space time thanksgiving turkey obliterating the big bang with drippings , stuffing itself with the bread crumbs of galaxies , constantly feasting on the universe but perverse enough to fuck with you personally if you take it that way it garnered an honorable mention at the wild poetry forum one week to recount the events from my life in intervening weeks would be beyond my scope or ability the mendocino men 's circle retreat is happening the weekend of the th , a process in which i 've been heavily involved , and kathleen and i are leaving for ny on the th to see her mother and assorted friends i hope to visit norm ball in dc and take in the smithsonian as well i am , however , a west coast snob , thinking our northern pacific coast far superior to anything they have out there in flatland , and the appalachians are nothing like the sierras for those who wished the melic board were reestablished , i can only say i have no plans for the immediate future , though i often regret ending the magazine when i did , but i was lacking a webmaster and engulfed in a two year depression , as followers of this blog know i 've purchased a stunt kite that is so far too difficult to fly , though i have lacked sustained winds the other day i shot par at the local frisbee golf course ! today i must spray the flower garden with deer repellent , made with spoiled egg salad and garlic , sold commercially i kid you not but it works those four hooved rats do n't like it at all i just had another rejection from poetry but i soldier on i hope my opinion of ashbery does n't disqualify me all for today , ce
