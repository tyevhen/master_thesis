? ? ? billy was the third of loving but busy parents when he was growing up , he thought that his parents favored his older siblings when billy was four , his parents divorced , and he remained with his father his brother and sister moved with his mother to a distant city billy rarely saw them feeling inadequate in raising his son alone , billys father responded by providing the child with costly toys and frequent trips to amusement parks as billy grew older and attended school , he had trouble focusing and was taken to a doctor for an appraisal of his abilities and disabilities billys medical evaluation showed symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , but billys father dismissed the diagnosis because of these difficulties in school , billy had trouble making friends and was ridiculed by his classmates this diminished his self confidence by the time billy was an adolescent , he had difficulty forming lasting relationships despite his expertise in athletics he was capable of high academic achievement , but his grades were below average teacher reports frequently cited his excessive need for attention , he felt lost and doomed to failure ive got a challenge for you guys , try answering the following questions from a humanist approach , psychoanalytical approach , behaviorist approach , cognitive approach , and a biological approach based on the case study above what is the basic cause of billys problems ? what will happen to billy ? what steps could billy take to improve his life ? ? ? ? remember , humanist approach emphasizes the concept that people are in control of their own destiny psychoanalytical approach emphasizes that a persons behavior is determined by primal drives and the experiences of early childhood behaviorist approach emphasizes the connection between stimulus response and behavior reward also , that a persons behavior is determined by the actions that were rewarded or punished cognitive approach emphasizes that a persons difficulties often stem from false perceptions of reality biological approach emphasizes the genetic , medical , and neurological components of the person theorists believe that theses biological factors influence behavior hormonal changes , brain anomalies , and neurochemical differences help determine a persons actions and subsequent changes in behavior answer one has to ask why did billy not move with his mother and siblings ? this coupled with his relationshipor lack there ofwith his father gives strong clues as to why billy is the way he is he feels abandoned and probably has not learned enough from his parents to devolop a clear and secure personality he like most chilldren has probably learned that the most effective way to get attention is to get in trouble after time this develops into involuntary behavior the behavior reward system is in place to teach us , after a pattern develops in this a reward is no longer neccacary if he continues he will find himself more and more at odds with society as he leaves childhood for adulthood further increasing the feeling of being different and unacceptable which he first exposed to as a child he will likely continue in his bad behavior striving for attention from society you can see it all the time in prison inmates , they are all willing and waiting to tell their stories to have someone hear and understand them , and will have deep anger and trust issues , which only continues his downward spiral what he really needs is loving caring parents , however seeing how this is unlikely cousnleing is the best and fastest option he needs to learn about himself and understand why he feels the way he does also positive and supportive friends and rolemodels will give him a sense of family , which really is just the basic feeling of love and security p s i love spellcheck , also let me know if i m at least on the right track this is just a guess question why do people think people with adhd are retarded ?
