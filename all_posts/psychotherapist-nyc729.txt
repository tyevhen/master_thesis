as a psychotherapist who specializes in doing trauma work , i work with many people who were traumatized as children this often means doing what john bradshaw and others have called inner child work because this type of trauma work has become so prevalent , i think many people associate the term inner child to a state that is only a reference to trauma but , being attuned to your inner child can also be a source of joy , inspiration , creativity , and happiness regaining a sense of playfulness and wonder childhood often holds moments of playfulness , openness , and a sense of curiosity and wonder that many people lose when they become adults if you were fortunate enough to have had a reasonably good childhood with loving parents , your childhood probably had many instances of joy and love it can be a rich inner emotional resource that you might have forgotten about but that is still available to you the joy of being attuned to your inner child rediscovering your inner child and creativity as a psychotherapist in nyc , over the years , i 've worked with many creative people writers , composers , and artists who want to tap into the part of the inner child who felt such an aliveness and openness to the world often , they are struggling to overcome their inner critic , that voice of negative prediction that causes creative blocks using clinical hypnosis or a combination of clinical hypnosis and somatic experiencing , they can tap into this deep resource but you do n't have to be involved with artistic endeavors to benefit from becoming attuned to the joy of your inner child feeling alive and open to new possibilities is beneficial to everyone , whether we tap into these feeling states for work , personal relationships or for your own sense of well being mind body psychotherapy can help to tap into creativity and joy so , instead of thinking of inner child work as always being about trauma or shame , you can also benefit from the positive aspects of your having been young , open , and playful a sense of playfulness in our personal lives and in our work can open up a well spring of creativity and joy that you might not even realize you still have available to you all of your feeling states are still a part of you they might not be as easily accessible during your everyday waking consciousness but learning to access these states with mind body oriented psychotherapeutic treatment modalities , like clinical hypnosis or somatic experiencing , can tap into your unconscious mind where these experiences might have been dormant for many years there is much to be gained by being attuned to that part of you that is often referred to as your inner child whether it 's resolving trauma , tuning into an openness and sense of wonder , or a combination of these experiences and more , working with the inner child can help you to feel more emotionally integrated and vibrant that sense of being more alive , joyful , inspired , creative and open enables you to lead a more emotionally fulfilling life i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist who provides psychotherapy services to individuals and couples , including dynamic talk therapy , emdr , clinical hypnosis , and somatic experiencing i have helped many clients to lead more fulfilling and enriched lives to find out more about me , visit my website http josephineferrarotherapy com to set up a consultation , call me at
