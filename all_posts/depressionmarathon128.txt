if i do nothing else today , and i just may not based on how i'm feeling right now , i 've already had what i hope will be a momentous day i ran this morning yes , that 's right , i ran it 's been just over months since i originally suffered a partial tear to my right achilles tendon i have n't raced in nearly years if you had told me after the mankato half marathon in mid october , , that i would n't race again until , hopefully , the fall of , i 'd have told you to shut up i knew when i tore my achilles in april , , that i was in for a long recovery , but i never expected this fifteen months is a long , long time and yet here i am , alive and fairly well , despite not being able to run for over a year that 's why my minute run this morning was a momentous occasion i was more than a little nervous when i stepped outside i was scared what if i could n't do it ? what if i suddenly felt pain again ? i knew i 'd be totally demoralized if that happened thankfully , it did n't jet and i walked for a block and then slowly picked up the pace i was so worried i had run for minutes at of my body weight on the alter g treadmill , at pace , on thursday , and it went well , but i knew running on the street would be different it was i felt very heavy and very slow initially i looked down at my watch after a few blocks i was running around pace , and i could barely breathe ! i decided not to look at my watch again after a few miles , i was still breathing heavily , but i was more relaxed and moving quicker than i had initially , and most importantly , i was n't having any pain i was hyper vigilantly monitoring every right foot landing and propulsion i stayed close to home in case i needed to stop suddenly , but i reveled in the sunshine and warmth i smiled and said hello to every runner i passed , and i cherished being among them i loved the feeling of running again i'm now sitting here satisfied and grateful , but i'm still a little nervous what if i have pain later ? what if it just does n't hurt yet ? i'm trying to push these thoughts out , however , and have faith that all will be okay i 've already iced my ankle , and i 'll foam roll my calves later i have to keep my focus on the actions i can control while leaving the results to god i ended up running over miles at minute pace i actually stopped more out of concern for my dog , jet , than for my achilles he was looking hot and tired , but he was smiling , too it 's been a long time for both of us a momentous day ? i certainly hope so carry on , my friends
