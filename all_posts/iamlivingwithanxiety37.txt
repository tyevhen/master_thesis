our culture encourages us to get the last word , to air our feelings , and to express our minds dr low warns us not to buy into these notions , as doing so will lead to temper and symptoms for example , i recently received an e mail from a co worker making a statement with which i do not agree my initial flare of temper compelled me to reply with my own opinion after all , i believed my viewpoint was correct i felt my skin tensing and my breathing quickening as i formulated a brilliant response however , i spotted that i was becoming worked up over a triviality and there is no right or wrong in the trivialities of everyday life i decided to abandon the need for a symbolic victory and control my muscles by not sending a response during this long holiday weekend i still find myself thinking about that e mail , but i choose to focus on secure thoughts before recovery i would have replied to the e mail while i might have thought that my argument was sound , the ensuing back and forth would have led to a temperamental deadlock , which would have harmed group life i e , work and i would have developed fearful temper as i awaited my co worker s response with my recovery training i have avoided a panoply of symptoms and for that i heartily endorse !
