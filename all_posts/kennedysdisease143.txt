after reading the natural history of sbma study , one of the first things i said was , aha ! the study explained or verified several assumptions for me it also made me look back a little more thoroughly on my progression i found it helpful and haunting in some respects i do not like to dwell too long on the negative aspects of living with kennedy 's disease unless it serves a purpose e g , preparing for the future i also do not like to make comparisons , but this study really made me think the average cag repeats of the patients studied was with the range being from to i have repeats and that is at the higher end of the spectrum i always wondered why i was fortunate enough to see my onset in the early s while several others with kennedy 's disease did not start seeing symptoms until the s and s i also wondered why at first the symptoms progressed slowly , but since the mid s , the progression seems to be accelerating i thought that leg weakness was my first adl , but now i believe hand tremors were first mid to late s i remember holding a coffee cup and saucer at my mother 's house and the cup was vibrating i knew that pneumonia was dangerous for those of us with kennedy 's disease i lost a brother this way , but did not realize that dysphagia choking dry drowning could be a cause of death before i started practicing qigong , my serum ck was and rising i was lifting weights and using a treadmill pushing myself to the limits several times a week within a year after starting qigong , however , my ck had dropped to almost normal it remained in the to range thereafter this proved that exercising smartly did not increase the damage to my muscles my serum ast and alt have been mid range normal throughout the progression my total cholesterol has also been normal with very little fluctuation through the years at least i have some good genes these last three bullets along with my cholesterol , weight and blood pressure are positive signs regarding my general health i need some good news occasionally , right ? i do not believe i have ever used kennedy 's disease as an excuse not to do something at times , however , i have used kennedy 's disease as a reason for not being able to do something it was normally because of safety concerns other times , it was because of a known inability to complete the task previous experience like mowing the lawn , cleaning the gutters , or climbing a ladder when i was younger , however , i often used kennedy 's disease as an excuse to push myself even harder and occasionally too far in my forties and early fifties i just could not accept that my legs were not strong enough to do certain things any longer because of this irrational thinking , i experienced many falls and several injuries today , i choose to believe that acceptance is far better than injury and it is different than giving up perhaps i am just a little smarter these days i sure hope so
