there was a time when the dream of retirement fired imaginations with visions of a better life , a happier life , in a resort setting or simply relaxing in a long time home , lingering over coffee , no alarm clocks , no demanding bosses , no office politics just a sort of endless , delicious summer where one 's life would be one 's own for some , retirement is this dream fulfilled for others , there are moments of quiet desperation , despite lovely settings and abundant leisure time there are those who find that their money is disappearing much faster than they ever imagined and that they may need to go back to work at an age when employers are less welcoming and physical limitations may preclude most work possibilities there are those who are increasingly distressed by diminished physical capabilities , by the aches and pains and limitations of age there are those who find time hanging heavy they do n't know what to do with themselves and may regret leaving the work force there are those who feel trapped in a marriage that worked , somehow , before retirement because the couple did n't spend much time together i 've seen such desperation in the couple who hunker down at the local mcdonald 's or starbucks he on his cellphone , she clipping coupons for hours on end without any interaction with each other there was a couple in a doctor 's waiting room , she on oxygen , he looking distant and grim and they were sniping at each other there are couples , too , who readily admit that they are sick of each other but ca n't afford to divorce , unable to live on divided assets all of these issues take on more urgency because of the serial losses of aging and letting go and , at the same time , because of a sense of limited time and resources the window of opportunity for new beginnings is closing and the choice , for many , seems to be between striking out in a late life change or accepting what is , however unsatisfactory that may feel some of these moments of quiet desperation are , at least in part , the result of planning based on fantasy that there would be enough money somehow , that happiness would come with freedom , that less than perfect relationships would transform in a new setting or lifestyle and these moments of desperation come when the fantasies fail to blossom into reality and when reality shows some harsh truths that one 's body is n't what it used to be and one is unlikely to morph from coach potato to super athlete with a little more gym time that the money required to maintain your working lifestyle is not enough and you 're faced with a choice of changing your expectations or going back to work that negative relationships and relationship patterns are unlikely to change without hard work from both of you or some hard choices that focusing solely on self and pleasure is n't the key to nirvana adjusting to the gap between expectations and reality , making your life in retirement work for you may take some major changes on your part even changes that feel small can make a big difference some steps that could make a positive difference want what you have instead of dreaming of the unattainable or looking back with longing on a former lifestyle fueled by two good incomes , take a look with gratitude at what you have now a roof over your head , healthy food , the freedom to create life anew , the love of friends and family and treasured pets life can feel wonderful when you live with gratitude for what you have find beauty where you are maybe you dreamed of retiring to a seaside cottage or a cool urban condo and found both out of your reach so you 're living in the same old house in the same old suburb or in a modest condo , apartment or mobile home or perhaps you 're living in a nice new retirement home in a strange new place maybe simply a new town in a different state or maybe in a manufactured oasis in the middle of a desert adjusting to what is and looking around with new eyes , you can begin to appreciate the comfort of your long time home and familiar surroundings you can take a deep breath and vow to discover all the positives in your new home town even if you 've relocated to a place that suddenly feels desolate if you let yourself , you can find beauty in the uniqueness of a desert environment or a busy urban area or the singular charm of a smaller town when you open your heart to what is , disappointments can turn to joy to improve your relationship , try acting and reacting in different ways you do n't get positive change by repeating those same old behaviors over and over so try something new do thoughtful things for each other instead of staying locked into gender roles a friend of mine told me recently that her across the street neighbor , who has severely arthritic hands , had called her during the dinner hour and asked her come lift a cooking pot filled with water and pasta to the sink for draining and rinsing the woman 's husband was sitting in a lounger not feet from the stove but he felt that anything to do with cooking and kitchen duty was women 's work look at nagging in a new way if the nagging is about your health and less than ideal lifestyle habits , instead of bristling , try seeing the love and caring behind the grousing have a serious , loving talk and enlist each other 's help in overcoming bad habits like snapping at each other or tuning each other out or cutting each other off conversationally during social events agree on a subtle signal that says please stop ! at the first sign of irritation triggers or excessive and pointless criticism this is n't a matter of convincing your spouse to act in a more civil manner monitor your own behavior , note what needs to change and see if your relationship does n't improve change your focus to making life better for others we all have aches , pains , limitations and disappointments as we enter the later decades of life but these seem less onerous if we shift our focus to others perhaps peers less fortunate than we are , perhaps to younger family members who could use a helping hand , loving guidance and affirmation , perhaps to strangers in need people who are homeless , those in hospitals , children needing extra help in the classroom , animals in need of rescuing or fostering there is so much that needs to be done to make life easier for those around us we 're limited only by our willingness to get involved with volunteer work , a small business or an expanded hobby , with a desire to help others , we can help ourselves as well there are , of course , some moments of quiet desperation that are triggered by tragic turns in our lives and are n't so easily solved simply with attitude adjustments or small changes but for many of the disappointments and moments of disillusionment that come as we settle into retirement , it 's important to remember that happiness in retirement is n't automatic because wherever you go , there you are your emotional baggage and habits and behavior patterns follow you wherever you go so take a look around and open your eyes , your heart and your mind and see what a difference you can make in your own life and the lives of those around you
