i am now back in my living room after days in northern wisconsin at the lake with my boyfriend , d you 'll have to forgive me for being out of touch i quite enjoyed being out of contact , actually my cell phone did n't even ring or vibrate once while i was gone ! my friends and family knew i was away , and they apparently decided to let me be away so it was me , d , jet , and d 's adult son for most of the past days and it was beautiful ! d has a lovely home on a lake while there , we introduced jet to woods , water , and deer we went boating jet was n't sure he approved of that , but he relaxed a bit the second time we took him out we water skied my forearms are sore today from hanging onto the tow rope ! we ran and walked on the trails d planned and cooked all of our meals , which were delicious we played games we tried to sit around the fire , but the mosquitoes got the best of us , so that did n't last long we watched movies , read , talked and relaxed my relationship with d is going very well we are more and more comfortable with each other it 's so nice when we are together this is only the second time in the past years that we 've been together for more than a weekend it seems we are both willing to put in the time and effort required to make this relationship work , especially considering how little time we get to spend together i'm so grateful for d and for our relationship plus , having this healthy relationship is another example of sticking a middle finger in the face of my depression ! i tried to post some pictures in this post , but they keep coming out sideways , even though i 've saved them to my computer in an upright position oh well , you 'll just have to trust me i had a wonderful , beautiful , relaxing vacation unfortunately , i must get back to life now , and that includes doing my household chores and getting my body and soul ready to go back to work tomorrow returning to my routine is always tough , and since procrastinating wo n't help , i guess i better get started
