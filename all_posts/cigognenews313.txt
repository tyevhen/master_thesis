am i missing something ? here is today s headline in the l a times march deaths tied to painkillers rising in u s see http articles latimes com mar local la me rx deaths they are discussing prescription painkillers drug fatalities are on the rise , seriously these are deaths from overdose so how do the authorities want to handle it ? limit the strength of the dosage and the quantity of drugs each day the usda drug administration is proposing a bill to do just that they agree that there is great pain from cancer but they do not recognize much else you know how i write about the scientific notion of antecedent consequent relations ? that means that for every result there must some kind of cause it is the cause that is left out of the equation by the fda they focus on the end result so here is what they say the data supporting long term use of opiates for pain , other than cancer is scant to non existent i am not sure where they reside but it does not appear to be on this planet there seems to be no recognition of emotional pain since they cannot see and observe it , it must not exist i am especially angry at this attitude because when i had back surgery years ago , the hospital , st vincents , had no serious painkillers on board why ? the state medical board was afraid they might addict their patients so we suffered terribly this is because they had no idea what addiction was or its provenance so what does the medical establishment suggest ? better computer control , tracking doctors who prescribe they have found widespread abuse by a handful of corrupt doctors and yes , they must be found and punished but that doesn t answer the question , why so much pain ? maybe it is pain on the rise , not just painkillers maybe drug use rises as pain does ? and just maybe there is a reason beyond cancer as they assume for pain clearly they have no notion of imprinted memory nor the kinds of great pain occasioned while we are in the womb and at birth indeed they do not recognize emotional pain at all so if you hurt because your father was a drunk and raped you , it is not counted yet the pain i see every day makes a broken leg seem like a simple inconvenience the screams i hear , the emotional torture , is never acknowledged in a culture where deep emotion is suspect it is the general george patton syndrome , get on with it , buck up and move on i cannot believe this attitude in this day and age these officials are well defended and cannot empathize with those who are not those in power have to defend well to climb the corporate ladder as i say , those who drink alcohol pass laws prohibiting the use of drugs for others they would never consider alcohol a drug like vicodin so they can vote to outlaw it but if we voted no alcohol we would hear them scream so someone goes for back surgery and the hospital does offer painkillers , why does he get addicted ? because there is still more pain inside emotional pain that has to be quieted too so he finally gets something to ease suffering he was never aware of before , pain from childhood and for the first time , since emotional pain is not recognized , he gets something that makes him feel much better why shouldn t he take that drug ? i know , because the powers that be do not acknowledge emotions if we could once understand that early pain persists , is powerful and drives us , then we could comprehend what addiction is it is the antecedent piece that is missing but once we do understand then we can do something about it , something effective and long lasting we could remove the pain from the system at last we cannot treat something we don t recognize so we repress it it will eventually kill the person prematurely those in power steal our lives and they have no right to
