first , congratulations to clink on her new job and her new appointment to a professional society 's board way to go , girl ! i learned a lot at apa this year , some of it useful , some of it simply interesting but useless where do i start ? clinkshrink already told you that we met some readers hi , sophizo , hi , shrink rap , and if you read the comments to clink 's post , well , there were others in the audience it was fun i did n't freak and faint thanks to roy for setting this up and for including me when is he coming to organize the rest of my life ? who is tigermom ? so at our presentation i learned about the psycho babble bulletin board and met dr bob i 've always wondered about this because when i 've googled myself i 've come upon posts to this psycho babble board by someone with my name sort of a weird coincidence , and this funny idea that people my patients included who would think this was me posting stuff i ca n't control , and the poster has my exact full name very weird , but there 's nothing i can do about this , and now i know what psycho babble is i , like clink , loved hearing the very brave patients talk about how this on line community has provided support , encouragement , and healing and then the third part of our workshop included a talk about on line virtual gaming i was n't sure what to make of this i have a kid who sometimes plays sports on line , but i'm not aware that anyone i know lives an average of hours a day hrs year in a virtual world with millions of players , hierarchies of players , the exchange of money for virtual 'property ' i 'll have to start asking i heard oliver sacks talk about musical hallucinations dr sachs has been in twice a week psychoanalysis for years or was it i had the sense that it was with the same analyst this probably deserves it 's own blog post john greist talked about ocd i'm not sure i learned much new , but it was good to know i was n't totally out of touch dr greist is an amateur race car driver i went to a very good symposium on treatment for substance abuse for cocaine addiction , people are using antabuse disulfuram , modafinil i hope i have that right and d amphetamine this brought the predicted questions from the audience about addiction marijuana dependence is a rapidly growing reason for seeking treatment especially in older folks meaning people in their late 's , and 's as well as adolescents marinol is the pill derivative form of thc there were talks on methadone and buprenorphine , and on motivational interviewing i did n't learn as much as i wanted to about the metabolic syndrome one studied showed that people gained less weight on average on zyprexa if they also took modafinil provigil they still gained weight , and the study only went weeks out max missed me , the judge enjoyed coffee with my husband , and everyone liked the wind up walking brain i brought home i had lunch and dinner and cocktails and overall i felt like the bernstein bears and too much conference happy to be home
