hi , again i e mailed you in september thanking you for your amazing book brainswitch out of depression i am now slowly and carefully doing my first step of reducing my anti depressant dose and would absolutely not be doing this had i not stumbled upon your book ! thank you for helping me get to this stage because i feel so strongly about the power of your book , i 'd like to buy many copies for friends , for the school i work at and for other locations the book is very affordable easy to get in a kindle version but is at least on amazon ca to get in print i was wondering if there was a way to purchase the book at a more typical cost trust me , i think it 's worth more than for how much it 's done for me ! so i could buy many copies of it and pass it around i tried to buy it off of your website but i do n't think it will ship to canada from there any suggestions ? i 'd love to pass along your brilliance to others thank you again more than i can say sincerely , m dear m , first of all i appreciate your letter thank you second , please consult with your doctor if you are reducing your drug dosages there may be dangerous side effects from withdrawal and as for the postage it costs about to send books to canada , about to send books and about to send books the books cost including custom fees
