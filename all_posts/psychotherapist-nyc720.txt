fear can be a debilitating force that keeps us stuck and immobilized we might want to accomplish certain goals , but overwhelming fear can keep us from even finding out what we need to do to get on the right path to achieve those goals sometimes , years go by , and the fear makes achieving our goals seem like an impossibility overcoming the fears that keep you stuck on my first day registering for college at hunter college of cuny , i met a woman who was getting the paperwork to apply to the college she told me that she 'd been waiting more than years to apply to college going to college had been her dream for all that time , she told me in a nervous and excited tone she 'd spent those years working and saving her money so she could go during those years , all she could get were dead end jobs that she hated , but she persevered with her goal in mind in order to save up for four years of tuition , she made a lot of sacrifices she kept a very strict budget she hardly ever went out socially she did n't buy any new clothes and she watched every penny she spent now , after saving all her money , she was finally ready to get the information she needed to apply no one in her family had ever gone to college , so this was a very big thing for her as listened to her more , it became evident that she 'd had so many fears about going to college , even in terms of the application process , that she never found out about financial aid , scholarships or loans her fear for something she very much wanted kept her from even getting basic information that could have saved her from delaying all those years and making unnecessary sacrifices she had been told by her parents that college was very expensive , out of reach for them and probably out of reach for her so , she avoided getting information and doggedly set about saving every penny , convinced that she had to sacrifice everything in order to begin the process of applying for college as she was telling me how she scrimped and saved , i wondered how she was going to feel when she found out she did n't need to wait all those years to make her dream come true as it turned out , i saw her a few months later , after she had been accepted to the college she told me how shocked she was that she was entitled to a substantial amount of financial aid , and she did n't need to sacrifice all those years , staying home , and depriving herself she realized that , during all those years , she allowed her fear of even getting information to keep her stuck , and when she finally mobilized herself to pursue her dream , it was n't nearly as daunting as she anticipated she regretted self sacrificing needlessly and wished she had looked into things sooner even though i did n't know this young woman well , i never forgot her story and the lesson it provided when we 're fearful of pursuing our dreams , they often seem so much more daunting than they turn out to be often , when we 're finally on the path where we want to be , we say to ourselves , wow ! this is n't as bad as i thought ! why did i wait ? i could have started sooner you can overcome fears that keep you stuck of course , it 's not always so simple overwhelming trauma often creates fears that make it very difficult to overcome we ca n't always bootstrap ourselves along to overcome our fears sometimes , we need help not knowing this young woman well , i do n't know what possible traumatic events might have occurred to her parents to cause them to feel that college was an almost unattainable goal for their daughter i do n't know what fears this young woman might have taken on from them or developed on her own but i could feel the regret and disappointment she experienced for allowing her fears to overcome her letting go of your fears working with a skilled hypnotherapist , it 's possible to overcome long held fears that keep you from achieving your dreams as i 've mentioned in other blog posts , clinical hypnosis is n't a magic bullet it 's not something that 's done to you while you passively observe but it can be an effective form of therapy to help you overcome the emotional obstacles that keep you stuck i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist i work with individuals and couples to find out more about clinical hypnosis , you can visit the professional hypnosis website american society of clinical hypnosis to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at or email me josephineolivia aol com
