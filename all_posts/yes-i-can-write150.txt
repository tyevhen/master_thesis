i keep feeling a need to write , and have felt for the last few days like i should write a post on unschooling because , you know , that 's what this blog has become almost entirely about but you know what i really want to write about today ? i want to write about tv shows a couple of years ago , i hardly watched any tv shows there were maybe one or two i watched with any sort of interest or regularity , but that was about it yet in recent times , i 've come to truly appreciate about ten different shows , and really , really love a couple of those ten having discovered the joys of watching shows on dvd when possible , i 've devoured whole seasons in the space of a few days , caught up in wonderful worlds filled with compelling characters current favorites include buffy the vampire slayer though a classic of modern television to most people , i only started watching it in july of this past summer , after having heard rave reviews from multiple people i was quickly sucked in no vampire pun intended , and after having gone through all seven seasons during the course of the summer and very early fall , i can say that this is my favorite show , ever terrific , hilarious dialogue genuinely believable character development great characters clever storylines i was by turns literally falling over laughing and bawling my eyes out so yeah , it 's just great ! being erica a sweet , funny , and moving story about a woman who 's building the life she truly wants through time traveling therapy my only favorite canadian show , since , well , there do n't seem to be many canadian shows to choose from at all , so considering the overall small percentage , the good ones are few and far between but this one is a real gem ! supernatural my newest discovery i'm currently nearly finished the first season , this show is about pretty guys fighting malicious spirits , demons , shapeshifters , and various other creatures of the night since i'm someone who likes both fantasy supernatural stories , and pretty guys , how could i resist it ? the interaction between the two main characters is great , and there 's plenty of humour , a must for me i ca n't think of a single show i like that is n't funny at least at times if there 's nothing to laugh at , i get bogged down in serious shit and just get bored sherlock really a mini series more than anything , i 've decided to count it anyway because it 's a recurring mini series ca n't wait for the next season ! i sure hope it 's longer than the first one by far the best on screen take on sherlock holmes i 've ever seen set in modern day , this fast paced , sharp , and witty show is just wonderful also ? i usually well , okay , mostly refrain from shipping non canon couples , but it 's obvious that sherlock and watson are made for each other and the show 's creators totally play on that ! other shows i enjoy include inspector lewis , house , the mentalist , and doctor who and what 's the point of my telling you about a few of my favorite shows , you ask ? well , besides recommending them to you , i want to talk a bit about storytelling you see , some people have this idea that storytelling is only worthwhile , only a valid way of spending time , if it fits a certain format most often , those who feel this way consider books to be that format yet storytelling is an art form , or more , a collection of art forms , that are incredibly diverse books , comics , plays , movies , tv shows , puppet shows , musicals all of these are different ways to tell a story , all can be equally , though in very different ways , captivating , interesting , thought provoking , and just plain entertaining i think there enters a certain snobbishness though , as people try to cast certain forms of storytelling as better than others there is the argument that tv has many harmful messages that there 's obvious sexism , racism , classism , homophobia and transphobia , fat hating , and other really nasty things present in most shows and that 's completely true but , since we live in a society that is sexist , classist , etc , everything created by members of this society , be it tv or novels or puppet shows , is as likely to perpetuate oppression as anything else in a society where oppression is so ingrained , it 's virtually impossible to find something , anything , without at least some nasty shit in it i suppose you could decide to not come into contact with any media whatsoever , and in the right circumstances that could certainly be managed , but even then , if you still talk to people , you 're going to encounter those some attitudes and things you 're trying to avoid which leads to my next point there 's a big difference between passive absorption and active engagement the first is what i think most people against television picture when they think of tv blank faced zombies sitting in absolute stillness in front of a flickering screen , their brains passively absorbing whatever passes over said screen yet in my house , that 's not how watching tv works to start with , it 's a social activity i virtually never watch tv shows alone all four members of my family like sherlock and inspector lewis the three women in the house like house , being erica , buffy , and doctor who emi and i like supernatural and we like discussing what we watch and when i say discussing , i mean we talk about everything from how hot that guy is , to the fact that in this show , that person is being treated as the token gay guy , or how police are glorified in many shows we discuss the building of stories and characters , scriptwriting etc , as well as how commonly found stereotypes and social norms are reinforced in tv shows , and how that might affect the people who watch said shows more passively than we do it 's not unusual for one of us , when watching a show on dvd , to snatch up the controller , pause it , and bring up some interesting point about something that just happened on the show active engagement might seem like a strange way to describe watching tv , but for my family , it seems pretty accurate does this mean i think that people who do n't watch tv shows or do n't own a tv are seriously missing out ? no , it does n't if going tv free makes someone feel freer , more whole , more relaxed , or in any way happier , hell , i think it 's great ! this also does n't mean that i love modern technology , or think it will exist in the future i see a future of radical decentralization , and a return to truly sustainable communities technologies based on exploitative practices have no place in that future but seeing as i'm a part of this culture for now , as are we all , i either embrace like buffy the vampire slayer or tolerate like money many aspects of it that i might think hold no place in an egalitarian and sustainable future life is adaptable , and perhaps i 'll decide at some point , maybe even in the near future , that i think the negatives of tv 's and tv watching outweigh the positives , and decide to make some changes around tv in my own life but for now ? for now i want to see if emi wants to watch the season one finale of supernatural , because i ca n't wait to see what happens
