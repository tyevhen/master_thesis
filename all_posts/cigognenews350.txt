there is a study done by kaiser medical on , subjects see for example http www cdc gov ncipc pub res pdf childhood stress pdf they tested them on childhood trauma , parents in prison , divorce , parental abuse , etc they gave them each an ace score no trauma was zero and it went up from there , depending on how much trauma there was in childhood those with an ace score of four were times more likely to have sex before age , twice as likely to develop cancer and emphysema , more likely to be alcoholics seven times more likely while those with a score of six were times more likely to have tried suicide those with zero scores had very little learning problems or trouble in school when the scores are four or higher school problems begin in short , trauma in childhood does bad things to adult life , something that probably is a given for most of us but wait ! that did not include womb life where major imprints and dislocation of function occur where the memories are more deeply embedded , where almost irreversible damage happens and where the greatest impact on the brain occurs in other words , the study has ignored the most crucial time of our lives where the crucible for most later behavior and physical symptoms get their start for example , it is more likely that the seeds for later cancer are there , in the early part of our lives while being carried then later life trauma , the obvious kind , a parent in prison are observed and are added to the pathological mix as the brain begins its incredibly rapid development while we are being carried , trauma in this time period is of utmost important and this means that any proper treatment means going back to address those traumas and undo their impact we are not simply victims of that abuse we are responders who can gain control of the trauma and surmount it it means being exposed again to that very same trauma , feeling its pain and thereby lessening the impact it breaks open the repression and allows for full feeling it means undoing the damage i have written how this can be done in my life before birth it can be done we do it and measure the results one result is the reduction of the levels of the stress hormone cortisol as stress comes down , immune function increases it also means that as we experience the early traumas fully , we are under far less stress these are measurable outcomes the implications of all this are , among other things , difficulty in concentrating and studying , and the inability to sustain paying attention it means later learning problems i would have thought that economic factors are important here , but evidently not as important as we might imagine a loving family is what counts most a carrying mother who takes drugs , drinks alcohol , is highly anxious and or depressed is starting serious damage for the child so this study just confirms the primal viewpoint which has been made public for over forty years adverse childhood experiences
