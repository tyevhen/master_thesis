when i first entered recovery , the concept of moving the muscles seemed foreign to me but my group leader insisted that the muscles will reeducate the rattling brain the idea seemed far fetched , as i thought the problem was with my mind yet i 've come to realize that muscles are an intricate part of the recovery process for example , when i suffered with checking obsessions and compulsions years ago , i realized that i could indeed control my muscles and not repeat checking the stove , door , or whatever had snagged my attention that day at the time , though , i did n't realize that i was exerting control over my muscles , but this concept is much clearer to me now controlling the muscles whether it involves using arm and leg muscles to face a fear of driving , using your esophagus muscles to not vomit food considered contaminated , and so on also easily lends itself to endorsement , because commanding your muscles to carry out an action or not takes effort effort that should be recognized and for just about all of us , our muscles will obey our commands if we tell our muscles to take us into a crowd , our muscles will not revolt they will not hesitate if the will commands them to do a task , they will do it and that is a comforting thought ! i endorsed for writing this post
