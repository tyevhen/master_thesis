a friend just sent me this very interesting article if you do n't fancy the read although i highly advise you should it pretty much explains why our generation , generation gypsy nothing to do with big fat weddings , find themselves unhappy despite all the successes we have experienced the article uses this amazing equation happiness reality expectations this equation made so much sense to me that i kinda found myself wondering why i had n't come up with it before , which nicely leads onto the point of gypsy 's being delusional i also enjoyed the facebook image crafting mostly i loved the article it was scarily relevant i am a generation gypsy , my parents are baby boomers and my grandparents were ww survivors i do have unrealistic expectations with regards to my overall life , i like to think i am 'wildly ambitious' and i confess that i am deluded when it comes to life and mainly my relationships however , i am not delusional about my career i know , i know i totally sound like this part 'even right now , the gypsys reading this are thinking good point but i actually am one of the few special ones ' i do not think i am special i do not think i am owed anything i know if i want the career , the job , the money that i do , i will have to go out there and work hard for it i certainly have never thought 'a great career is an obvious given for someone as expectational' as myself i do n't expect my career and life path 'to stand out amongst the crowd' i do n't think i am destined for something better i just want to be i suppose , to be brutally honest which lets face it , i am most of the time the trouble i have in my own happiness equation is not work related at all it 's much deeper than my career as far as i'm concerned , my career is on the right track i am proud of where i am but i recognise the long journey ahead of me i am , however , disappointed by how my relationships have turned out i did expect to be in a long term relationship by the time i turned who would n't expect that ? i suppose , in that respect , the article is bang on after identifying all of the above , the article concludes with three simple actions to follow along your life and career path stay wildly ambitions stop thinking that you 're special ignore everyone else as i already hold this view point with regards to my career , perhaps i should apply these rules to the part of my life that i do feel disappointed by relationships
