unless you have been living under rock for the past few days you are aware of the recent news that secret service personnel were involved with prostitutes in a hotel in colombia , prostitution is legal and they were not in direct detail for guarding the president why is this news ? furthermore , why do we care ? celebrities and athletes alike get divorced , and say stupid things in sports , it happens on weekly basisi e michael vick , tiger woods , ozzie guillen so i ask again , why do we care ? since this is an election year , candidates love to make personal attacks on each other if someone is a good president , or accountant , or therapist why do i care what they do in their personal life ? it 's just that , personal i think sometimes we look to these individuals as role models for ourselves and our children truthfully , they could be looked at as professional role models , but not as personal role models conversely , tim tebow and jeremy lin prove this theory wrong and maybe the reason why people are still wrapped up in tebow mania and linsanity public figures who practice what they preach on a more psychological aspect , some of us may live vicariously through these individuals interestingly , in the journal of experimental social psychology , there is an article written called vicarious goal satiation the article supports the notion that when people observe others completing a task successfully they are more willing to complete that task themselves successfully could it be we think like this ? could be the reason we say there life is great , i want that , and could have that too we may idealize and or become envious of what they have accomplished and say to ourselves if i had what they had , it would perfect knowing what these people are doing talking eating watching reading , evolutionary psychologists agree it allows society determine who is trustworthy bottom line we have no idea what goes on with the officials , celebrities , athletes behind close doors it may appear that there life is a lot better , but it may not be all that greatbut it may top of the week to you ! cheers , yes
