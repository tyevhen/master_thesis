two years ago , i wrote about a speech recognition program that was part of windows i experimented with this program for several months even though it was adequate , it just wasn t what i was looking for this last winter , i experienced more problems with my hands and fingers than in past years typing became more difficult especially after i came in from the cold in february , costco offered dragon naturally speaking software for sale on their website i was interested and went to nuance s website and read stop typing and start doing dragon is the world s best selling speech recognition software it turns your talk into text and can make virtually any computer task easier and faster from capturing ideas and creating documents , to email and searching the web , to using simple voice commands to control many of the popular programs you use every day at home , work and beyond even though nuance advertises that dragon is accurate right out of the box , i was a skeptic yet , i had a need and this program might be a solution for that reason , i decided to gamble a month ago i bought a copy of dragon naturally speaking home ver for first experiences i didn t like the headset that dragon provided i found the freetalk easyman usb headset that i use for skype calls to be far more accurate and comfortable it took about minutes to install and set up and train the program even though i have no way of determining the accuracy , it sure was close like any program , the more you use dragon , the easier it is to use dictating within dragon is relatively easy remembering all the navigation and editing commands that allow you to use the full power of dragon , however , takes a little more time fortunately , a cheat sheet is provided as well as several tutorials yes , there are still moments where using the keyboard is actually faster yet , the more i use dragon , the less i use the keyboard the program works with microsoft outlook , word and excel as well as many other programs including gmail three browsers are also currently supported internet explorer , firefox and chrome with a little experimenting , i found that it also works with several other programs including microsoft onenote for people using smart phones , there is also an app that allows you to dictate and transfer the file to your pc or mac conclusion after using dragon for a month , i find it difficult to compare to the windows speech recognition program the windows program feels more elementary while dragon feels much more capable and fun to use i base this comment more on the start up curve , ease of use , and accuracy of dragon is dragon for everyone ? no , not necessarily yet i have found it to be a helpful , fun and comfortable program to use i also believe that the more that i use dragon , the better the tool it will become in fact , of this blog article was written using dragon
