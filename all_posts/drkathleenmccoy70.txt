i do n't want my kids to follow in my footsteps , to do what i did ! his vehemence came as a surprise when i opened the email from a dear , long time friend with two college age daughters my first thought was that his daughters would do well to emulate their dad i 've known him since he was a twentysomething just starting out in new york publishing and quickly making a name for himself with his combination of insight , kindness , brilliance , hard work and decency but he is adamantly warning his daughters away from the same path encouraging them to take summer jobs in financial services , corporate public relations anything but journalism , book publishing and other print media i tell them that they have a choice to work hard and make good money in business or to work just as hard and make practically nothing in publishing i do n't want them to have the hardships and the uncertainty , especially with the changing nature of the publishing business these days , he wrote i want them to have good lives with financial stability and the freedom to pursue all their creative interests on the side i could see his point if i had children , i might be inclined to urge them to explore careers that they could enjoy and , at the same time , have bright employment and financial prospects would i have listened if my parents had urged me in a similar direction ? probably not i'm the aging poster child for doing what you love in work where money is unpredictable i have been an actress , a writer and a psychotherapist all hold the potential for good earnings , with hard work and a large very large portion of luck acting , in particular , is an iffy bet in terms of financial security with so much more than talent involved in getting a coveted big break and even though writing and psychotherapy are more accessible and less arbitrary than show business , financial bonanzas can be elusive i have written books for major new york publishers only one so far has earned decent money and that has been over a period spanning more than years i optimistically started a psychotherapy private practice after the investment of tens of thousands of dollars in advanced degrees in midlife and found , with the dominance of managed care , my earnings to be steady but modest a college friend kandace , now deceased , also had a journalism degree followed by a midlife switch to psychotherapy what is it about us ? she asked over lunch one day why do we gravitate to these various careers where it 's so hard to make a living ? do we have a hidden poverty wish ? one wonders perhaps it 's a matter of some people putting more value on financial security while others value the experience of following a dream and one wonders how young people hear these cautionary tales and fervent advice do they hear them with the puzzlement evident on benjamin 's face in the graduate when a family friend urged him to consider a career in plastics or do they take this advice more to heart than previous generations at a time when student loans are so overwhelming and full time jobs with good salaries and benefits are so hard to come by ? and , for a young person with creative passions , is it possible to have a happy , satisfying life with these pursuits relegated to the sidelines ? or , in the long run , is the pleasure of following one 's dreams worth the financial risks ? does it make sense to pursue high paying jobs , even if the passion is not there ? is following one 's low paying passions always a mistake ? how have you advised your growing or grown children ? how have they found a satisfying balance in their lives ? more to the point what choices have you made in life that you hope your children do n't make ? parental advice can make more of an impression on a young person than many of us imagined either as put upon youth or as concerned parents i remember my own parents having their own urgent career advice for us advice we heard with half closed eyes and long suffering attitudes father urged my brother michael to become a medical doctor , both to avoid being drafted for vietnam service and to have lifelong security he himself had aspired to a medical career after experiencing the disappointments of engineering work in a corporate setting but did n't feel he could start over he wanted michael to get his career off to a great start mike shrugged off the advice , setting his sights on becoming a college math professor and arguing that draft avoidance was an insufficient reason to choose a career in medicine mother advised my sister tai , who showed great skill and compassion when family members were ill , to become a nurse tai rolled her eyes and insisted that her passion was dance both of my parents rushed to implore me to become a writer which , only in comparison with my other passion , acting , seemed like a more reasonable bet it took combat in vietnam and the passage of time to move michael in the direction of medicine , in his own time and for his own reasons it took even more time for tai to see the wisdom of a career in nursing a goal she began to pursue in earnest after life saving brain surgery , a marriage on the rocks and a toddler daughter to support i enjoyed five years of doing both writing and acting in my twenties until i became increasingly aware of too many fifty something actors and actresses who were so talented , so deserving of fame and fortune , who lacked only luck they were still waiting on tables or driving cabs while hoping against hope for a big break writing , while competitive , did n't seem as arbitrary if you had talent and a good work ethic , you had a chance success did n't hinge on your looks at least then in time , we all became converts to our parents' point of view even if our parents did n't live to see tai 's epiphany and yet there are young people who follow their dreams and make them happen my friend tim has four children three of them in the entertainment field laura is an award winning playwright and college professor mary kate is a film and t v actress stephen is a musical theatre actor singer who works non stop his fourth child , eliza , is an elementary school teacher all work steadily and love what they do none are likely to experience financial windfalls but they 're content these are strange times for those of us in midlife and beyond a time in life when we look back with longing or amusement or regret at roads taken or not taken and we want to spare those we love who come after us from some of the rough patches along the way and so we warn them away from certain career fields or behaviors or relationships without being sure that they 've heard us then we cross our fingers and hope for the best but we know , as our parents did before us , that young people make their own lives , their own success and failure , their own happiness and regrets and we can only watch and cheer them on and comfort them along the way
