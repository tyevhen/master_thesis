this article came to my attention this week from the new york times blogs the author identifies himself as a philosophy professor and scholar who is an expert in french philosophy he presents some viewpoints of foucault and others to criticize the dsm and of course the clinical method in psychiatry i will be the first to admit his initial argument is confusing at best and is based on foucault s observation what we call psychiatric practice is a certain moral tactic covered over by the myths of positivism indeed , what psychiatry represents as the liberation of the mad from mental illness is in fact a gigantic moral imprisonment in the next sentence the author acknowledges foucault may well be letting his rhetoric outstrip the truth , but his essential point requires serious consideration from my viewpoint whenever an author s rhetoric outstrips the truth it means that at the bare minimum any observer should be skeptical of the biases involved and these appear to be the common themes that we see from antipsychiatrists it does not take the author very long to develop that angle psychiatric practice does seem to be based on implicit moral assumptions in addition to explicit empirical considerations , and efforts to treat mental illness can be society s way of controlling what it views as immoral or otherwise undesirable behavior he gives examples of the previous treatment of homosexuality and women and uses this as a platform for suggesting there s no guarantee that even today psychiatry is free of similarly dubious judgments with no credit given to spitzer s role in both the dsm and eliminating homosexuality as a mental illness back in the s where is the rest of america on that issue even today ? he latches on to the bereavement exclusion as the latest example of how psychiatrists are trying to dictate how people live and how various nonphysicians are better equipped to decide about whether the bereavement exclusion should be left in place like every other commentator he waxes rhetorical himself using the well worn descriptor medicalization and suggesting part of the motivation for these changes is pressure from the pharmaceutical industry i recently posted a response to a less well written criticism from the washington post that addresses these issues and i would encourage anyone interested in finding out what is really going on to take a look at that post the question here is what have professors foucault and gutting missed in their critiques about psychiatry ? it turns out they have missed a lot the first obvious flaw is the misinterpretation about the role of psychiatric diagnosis and a diagnostic manual for psychiatrists the dsm or any technical diagnostic manual does not represent a blueprint for living and there is no psychiatrist who has ever made that claim this error is promulgated in the media by referring to the dsm as a bible in fact , it is not a bible or blueprint for living psychiatrists more than anyone realize that they are addressing a small spectrum of human behavior with the goal of alleviating suffering and restoring function the second flaw is that changing a diagnostic criteria in a dsm has any meaning with regard to treatment and diagnosis in the case of bereavement that ignores the fact that only a tiny fraction of patients with complicated bereavement or depression ever come to the attention of a psychiatrist grief is a normal human reaction and everybody knows it taken to an absurd level if organized psychiatry said that everyone with grief needed to take an antidepressant for the simple fact that we have special knowledge about how people should live we would have no credibility at all people everywhere know that grief is common and expected and severe mental illnesses are not at that level psychiatry is an extension of the common man s psychology the third flaw has to do with impairment a diagnosis can be made only with an impairment dimension from dsm iv in dsm iv , each of the mental disorders is conceptualized as a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress e g , a painful symptom or disability i e impairment in one or more areas of functioning or with significantly increased risk of suffering , death , pain , disability or an important loss of freedom in addition , this syndrome or pattern must not be merely an expectable and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event , for example , the death of a loved one dsm iv the critics never acknowledge that like all physicians , a psychiatrist s role is to treat illness and alleviate suffering further , the clinical method in psychiatry is the only specialty training that emphasizes clinical neutrality and recognizing emotional and intellectual biases that impact the physician patient relationship and offers ways to resolve them that is hardly a model for forcing value judgments about preferred mental states on people who other physicians are frequently unable to treat because of their own value judgments the author also erroneously concludes that it is dangerous to make psychiatrists privileged judges of what syndromes should be labeled mental illnesses based on the fact that they have no special knowledge about how people should live since psychiatrists do not make that claim , and since various groups including governments and religious institutions have been making these judgments for centuries with very poor results , i would suggest that psychiatry has had some problems but the progress here is undeniable that makes psychiatrists experts in their own field in their own field and the purveyor of their own diagnostic methods and not a claim that people should live in a particular way dsm iv takes pains to point out that it is classification system for syndromes and not people the dsm is not designed for an untrained person to look at and make a diagnosis or get guidance for living it is designed to be a common language for psychiatrists who have all had standardized training i would also like to suggest that the same philosophical criteria be seriously applied by philosophers to the pressing problems within the health care system the dsm is not even a gnat on that landscape we have had nearly years of active discrimination by governments and insurance companies against persons with mental illness while much criticism has been heaped on the bereavement exclusion criteria , people with addictions and serious mental illnesses are routinely denied potentially lifesaving interventions this discrimination has been well documented and it has fallen disproportionately on the mentally ill jails and prison have become de facto mental hospitals people are being treated with addicting drugs on a large scale to the point that many consider opiate use and deaths from overdose to be an epidemic governments save money and pharmaceutical companies and the managed care cartel prosper contrary to the author s suggestion that psychiatrists are more than ready to think that just about everyone needs their services psychiatrists are rare and access is strictly controlled by managed care companies and the government even if a person sees a psychiatrist , their medications , access to psychotherapy , and access to hospital treatment are all dictated by a business entity rather than their doctor it would seem that philosophers could find something to critique in that glaringly bleak health care landscape other than a trivial change in the diagnostic manual of a vanishing medical specialty if not , i would be very skeptical of their arguments george dawson , md , dfapa gary gutting depression and the limits
