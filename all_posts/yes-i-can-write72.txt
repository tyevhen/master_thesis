my mother recently turned to me , looking thoughtful , and asked do you ever feel out of place in groups of non unschoolers ? my sister and i had just come back from a party , and it seemed to occur to her that she 'd never asked that question before slightly startled , i thought about it for a moment , and replied not really not if i have something else in common with the group , at least that question got me thinking , though , as i feel it deserves a longer and more thoughtful answer as a child , i always felt out of place in schooled groups but then again , i frequently felt out of place in homeschooling groups as well , seeing as the only ones around when i was young were highly religious , conservative , and not so into unschooling or even relaxed homeschooling i was and hey , still am shy , and it took me a while to find groups i really felt good being a part of the first groups i did feel comfortable in were unschooling ones , in my teens , once i started going to events like conferences and not back to school camp nbtsc vermont source but as an adult , it 's different and in the years since i started hanging out with unschoolers , i 've frequently felt like i belonged quite well in various groups , both unschooling and not ! as with anyone , all it really takes is having something or multiple somethings in common with the group you 're in if you have a shared identity , interests in common , if you understand the social expectations of the particular community or type of group you find yourself in , you 'll probably feel pretty comfortable if you do n't , well , then maybe you wo n't feel so at home that party i 'd just come back from , when my mother decided to ask that question , was made up almost entirely of something queers i identify as queer , and i know the language and vocabulary of social justice , the terminology most often used to discuss sexuality and gender , and share the same hippie ness often found in such communities that 's the type of group i 'll happily end up in conversations with multiple people , and wo n't be likely to feel out of place at all , even though most people there currently are or recently were students i do n't deliberately bring it up , but sometimes my lack of schooling still manages to make it 's way into the conversation you said you 're a writer , where do you write ? blogging , mostly , a few articles in a couple of magazines cool ! what do you write about ? alternative education , mostly how did you get interested in that ? well , i did n't go to school in this particular case the subject did come up at one point in the evening , which led to one person mentioning they went to an alternative elementary school and another one commenting how the linear way things are taught in schools does n't actually fit the way most people learn perhaps the reason i feel so comfortable in the groups i most often find myself in is because the communities i 've gravitated to are all non mainstream not just the unschooling community , but the queer community , politically radical communities , general hippie organic farming contra dancing type crowds communities that both have a lot of overlap with each other , and also tend to be very unschool friendly that does n't mean i do n't still get stupid questions sometimes , but it does mean that unless someone goes out of their way to ask inappropriate questions or make me feel othered , i 'll probably feel like i fit in pretty well and when i do feel out of place , as does inevitably happen sometimes whether it 's because the group at an event i went to was n't the type of group i thought it would be , or i venture out of my regular type communities to go to some band party of my sister 's , while it 's sometimes because of unschooling , it 's as often as not because i feel like i'm the queerest person there , or because i'm dressed strangely compared to those around me , or a combination of all of those things it 's virtually always more complicated than just i'm the only unschooler here , wow i feel left out ! which kind of begs the question , how much does unschooling affect you ? how much has unschooling affected me ? i feel like unschooling has definitely had a huge impact on my life , as the very existence of this blog kind of shows i feel that being an unschooler is an important part of my identity but , so are many other things i think unschooling has shaped the way i look at things but , so have plenty of other experiences in my life not going to school has definitely affected the way i relate to people , but i do n't really think it 's made it harder to relate to people or at least , no more so than any of my other identities i'm just never quite sure how much credit to give to unschooling , how much of me was and is shaped by having not gone to school and how much would have been me no matter the educational experience i had my opinion on the matter changes fairly frequently sometimes i have felt that other people are setting me apart because of my education , sometimes i feel unschooling makes a bigger mark on people than other times who knows all i do know is that it 's important to me , but it 's far from the only important element or experience in my life and most of the time at least , it 's not something that makes me feel out of place ! i'm always really interested in how other adult unschoolers feel about this do you feel unschooling has set you apart ? changed the way you relate to people ? is it an important part of your identity ? i 'd love to hear your thoughts !
