i am not against statistical research it is essential but too often research studies are a stand alone phenomenon true unto themselves but unrelated to a larger picture and other key phenomena they are not plugged into a bigger frame of reference and that is my quarrel with constant statistical studies , especially in psychology let me give you an example there is a new study that states serotonin promotes patience the idea is that animals can wait longer for reward once given serotonin and , not surprisingly , the animals failed the test after being given something to stop serotonin production ok we have the results , but the why we don t have their conclusion these findings suggest that activation of serotonin neurons is required for waiting for delayed reward ok fine our clinical experience shows that the more activated the top level neo cortex , the less impulses break through to force impulsive behavior it is one way we know that serotonin is an inhibitory chemical we know that very early neglect and trauma require the production of more serotonin we now know that a dog can be more patient with injected serotonin a frame of reference would inform us that high level cortical functioning can be recruited to shut down feelings and make us feel better and be patient that general inhibition can lead to patience and that serotonin can shut down feelings and impulses and when we do that we increase the ability to wait my birth trauma patients are often impulse ridden i don t want to drown the fish but here is one more example almost of patients with coronary heart disease suffer from major depression another have some symptoms of depression again , why ? the problem with statistical studies is that we get statistical truths and in the usual research we get correlations this correlates with that , etc what we don t get are causes of disease correlations never do that , and indeed in our field of psychiatry and psychology we are looked at negatively because we offer causes or at least generating sources scientists are too often content to do stand alone research and too often it is the left brain that is content with statistical studies because it requires little further imagination we don t have to engage in pesky thoughts beyond what we see and measure we don t have to posit implications it is one reason we do not get beyond freud and or cognitive therapy is is why we have rigid , inflexible , dry results and scientists seem to prefer it that way equating dryness with science these are interesting studiesabove but they lack a frame of reference , which is what i require , a truth beyond the facts a frame of reference is essential in order to make sense of our results for that we need experience with patients to see how theory and research studies merge with clinical observations the proof in the eating it is the frame of reference that can tie two disparate studies together and provide broader implications it is indeed a truth beyond the facts that truth requires a frame of reference it seems that it is right brain that supplies the frame of reference , the meaning and implications of our studies , while the left brain deals with point by point statistics we need both in our therapy and our theory it is why statistical results are rarely enough , yet psychologic science is stuck there and why so little has changed in therapy over the decades take migraine we have had success in treating it one research study found that oxygen therapy helped alleviate its suffering it was stand alone research our own frame of reference after seeing dozens of migraine patients over the years , indicates serious oxygen lack during the birth process , usually due to massive anesthesia given the birthing mother it causes a serious oxygen decrease in the baby who struggles for air one result of this oxygen loss is the precursor for migraine constriction of blood vessels to struggle with the loss of oxygen and what is one treatment for it ? oxygen and treating dozens of those migraine people led us to a breadth of data to provide a frame of reference i didn t have to concoct a theory i had to observe closely and note what i saw i rather doubt that anyone could come up with our hypothesis with statistics alone at least now after almost one hundred years of headache research i still have not seen possible causes mentioned what is lacking ? a frame of reference we really can t come up with a frame of reference with a one off study we need a good deal of information with each patient we gather more evidence , and we modify our theory accordingly our patients are our research subjects we are now correlating our vital sign results we will soon know how and when blood pressure and body temperature change with feelings our results are found in our patients they have the answers our clinical work has found depression to be a forerunner for later heart disease because of deep repression involved in both and from our clinical knowledge of how early repression sets in when in our work we extirpate pain out of the system we alleviate depression and possibly prevent heart attacks it 's not that we are depressed and also then we have heart disease it is that deep suppression of early pain , often begun in our womb life , activates heart cells and affects later heart function that is , constant repression is involved in depression and heart disease seeing the whole person allows us to develop a frame of reference that statistics usually cannot do both heart disease and depression emanate from the person and begins most often during life in the womb no theory of womb life no understanding of its role in heart disease so if we treat heart disease by stand alone methods , leaving the imprints out of the matter , we are possibly ensuring another attack this is one reason that in therapy with serious disease if we do not address the generating sources , the imprint , there is a constant danger of recidivism and yet if we add imagination frame of reference to our results we are often looked at as unscientific because we have gone beyond the facts this is a dilemma because too often getting ahead of the facts can indeed be dangerous and unscientific look at our pal freud , he posited childhood sexuality out of his own unconscious , nary a fact in sight the danger is that a largely left brain scientist a right brain scientist is too often an oxymoron cannot objectively supply an untrammeled frame of reference our brain research indicated a more equalized brain in patients after one year of our therapy what this means to me is a more objective one a brain that will follow facts and produce a relevant meaning , not fabricating theories out of the unconscious
