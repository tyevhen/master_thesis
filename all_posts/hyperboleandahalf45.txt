you know how hawks are really talented at eyesight ? i'm like that except with finding things as a child , i was a ferocious hide and go seek player my reflexes became so sharp , that it was almost as if i could see into the future and anticipate the hiding spots of my classmates it was almost unfair my powers have only grown since then , but all gifts come with great responsibility boyfriend discovered my powers early on when he thought that he lost his wallet but actually it was just on the floor since then , he has grown to depend on me to find his things yesterday , he was like allie , where are my keys ? i did n't want to stop playing online bingo , so i was like i do n't know boyfriend allie find my keys me no boyfriend yes me no boyfriend suuuuuuuuuuuuperrrrrrrrr suuuuuulllkkkkk ! ! ! ! me okay ! ! ! ! boyfriend where are they ? me have you checked the couch ? boyfriend oh my god ! ! how do you do that ? ? ? ? me shit i hate it when i'm right because this only reinforces the cycle of dependency this is a terrible dynamic because what happens if i fall off a boat and hit my head on a log and i go into a coma ? boyfriend wo n't be able to find anything and he 'll die i am not being helpful by letting him depend on me to find things for him you guys , i have to break the cycle i have to hide all of boyfriend 's things and then pretend like i do n't know where they are updates to follow update i hid a bunch of things and when boyfriend got home , i was all ready to be like do you need to brush your teeth ? how about now ? how about now ? but really how about now ? why do n't you just brush them now it 'll save you time before bed and when he went to go brush his teeth i was going to be like oh no where 's your toothbrush ? but then boyfriend was all meeeeeeeeeeeeh , i feel siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick and i could n't do it because he is lying on the couch like this
