my virgin post was bared to the world exactly minutes ago , and i already have four views ! this is so much more gratifying than working on my thesis , which is worrisome since only minutes now have passed , i am still sitting at a booth next to the chick fil a , trying not to start a downward spiral of guilt about the seven million calories i just consumed but , hey , i drank tea instead of coke , so at least my bones wo n't crumble inside my body when i get old being unemployed , err full time student , i have the entire glorious day spread out before me should i hold my ground here in the food court and type to the music of the people shutting down the restaurants for the week ? should i walk to the campus library there 's a nice spot on the rd floor with big windows and the sweet smell of musty books ? or should i head to a coffee shop for a little hipster studying ? maybe i 'll do all of the above in that order by the way , i have exactly one week to turn in pages to my adviser so far , i 've written a page , but i have one hell of an outline does this mean i ca n't go out this weekend ? oh no
