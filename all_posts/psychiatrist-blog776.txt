from time to time , our readers comment that they are distressed with a diagnosis a psychiatrist has given they 've met with a doctor , talked for a while half an hour , an hour , maybe two hours and based on whatever information the psychiatrist has , a diagnosis is made maybe it 's right , maybe it 's not , and maybe the diagnosis will change over time some readers have commented that they object to the idea that psychiatrists must assign a diagnosis to be paid , when in fact there is no diagnosis , and they think that 's wrong the psychiatrist should work for free ? since i do n't accept insurance , i'm not obligated to make a diagnosis , but if i do n't put one on the statement , the patients wo n't get reimbursed some tell me that they are n't submitting psychiatric claims to an insurance company , others do n't have insurance , and many do submit claims i'm left to wonder why someone with no psychiatric diagnosis would consult a psychiatrist to begin with , especially since some diagnoses adjustment disorder , for example , or anxiety not otherwise specified are not particularly stigmatizing i understand that people are miserable with mental illnesses the symptoms are debilitating and miserable i also understand that people are angry about being told they have an illness that they do n't agree they have it 's a bit like being judged , or like feeling unheard , or even dismissed some docs may not spend the time necessary to make the right diagnosis , sometimes the diagnosis evades us , and sometimes patients do n't agree with us as to what we deem 'pathology' or symptoms , versus normal reactions or behaviors what has perplexed me , however , is the claim that the label itself is what causes the problem i 've been practicing for a long time , and i'm not aware that anyone has ever had a problem because of a diagnostic label i 've stuck on an insurance form i think that most people who worry that their diagnosis will cause others to judge them negatively , simply do n't tell people that a doctor says they have disease x and many will say that 's unfair , that people should be able to openly announce their psychiatric illnesses without worrying about the reaction or judgments of others , the way they do their medical illnesses , but personally , i'm not much for announcing health issues in open ways unless it 's necessary enlarged prostates , diarrhea , vaginal discharges , coughing up phlegm , the details of where one is injecting one 's insulin , are simply not everyone 's cup of tea at the dinner table sometimes people behave in distressed or dysfunctional ways and the fact that they have a psychiatric disorder is obvious this is not because of the title of the label , it 's because of the symptoms of the illness and the person 's behavior the psychiatrist 's diagnosis gave it a name , but the problem belongs to the patient here 's my question for you if a diagnostic label alone has caused your life to change , tell us your story i do n't mean if it 's upset you and caused you personal subjective distress , or if you 've worried about having your psychiatric history discovered , but if the label itself has caused you outside difficulties or limited your life , tell us how
