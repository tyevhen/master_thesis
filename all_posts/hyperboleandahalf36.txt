i have n't always been an unemployed pseudo hobo when i was in college , i often worked during christmas and summer breaks serving food and bussing tables in my hometown i have a lot of stories i could tell you from those times , but one in particular sticks out in my mind i was having a really bad day i had barely slept the night before because being scheduled for an early shift had n't made me any less nocturnal i had n't gotten anything to eat either i forgot to pack a lunch and i was stalwartly holding out on buying something because working for an hour plus a paltry amount of tips kind of makes you reluctant to purchase a hamburger if you do n't absolutely have to my sleep deprivation and hypoglycemia were only aggravated by a string of rude and demanding customers one guy did n't like the shape of his burger patty , a kid threw a fish stick at my head , some snobby lady made fun of my gaudy , oversized work uniform and i was verbally molested more times than i could count in light of all of this , i was overjoyed to see a friendly looking old man come in and seat himself in one of the booths the seniors who came into the restaurant were usually delightful to be around and i felt relieved that maybe i would get to experience a fulfilling and kind interaction for the first time that day i brought him a menu and cheerfully asked if there was anything he would like to drink he was like i quickly went and got him a big glass of cold milk i handed it over to him with pride , feeling good about my prompt reaction time and smiling service he stared at the milk silently for a few moments before shouting i was surprised by his reaction to the milk , but i obliged his request and went back to get him a smaller glass we only had two different glass sizes , so i chose one of the smaller ones and brought it back to the man 's table , again feeling proud of my ability to provide quick , tailored service with a smile he looked at me he looked at the milk he looked back at me then his wizened face contorted into a menacing scowl and he shrieked i felt a little discouraged , but not yet defeated as i noted before , we did n't have any intermediate sized glasses , but that was n't going to stop me from getting this man the exact right amount of milk no , i needed to find a solution ! that solution ended up being filling one of the large glasses halfway it was n't the prettiest way to present milk , but it got the job done i trotted the half full glass of milk over to the man , who was now scowling at me from across the room like he was expecting me to fail i cautiously held it out to him it became immediately apparent that my crafty solution was not satisfactory i said , sir , we do n't have any medium sized glasses we only have large glasses and small glasses man what the hell are you talking about ? me the restaurant only has two sizes , small and large we do n't have any medium cups man why do n't you have any other cups ? me i do n't know it 's stupid i'm sorry man do something about it me i 'll try i scurried back to the kitchen to work on somehow hand crafting a medium sized glass i had very little to work with we had some styrofoam to go cups that were the same size as the large in restaurant cups i took one of the styrofoam cups and cut about three inches off of the top of it with a steak knife it was not pretty it looked like i had tried to gnaw the cup apart with my teeth but it would have to suffice i filled the monstrosity i had created with milk , took a deep breath and walked toward the man 's table i could see him glaring at me , daring me to disappoint him one more time my hands shook as i held out the cup to him , hoping , hoping , hoping maybe he would n't notice the jagged edges , maybe he would n't care that there were little bits of styrofoam floating in his milk maybe nope he ended up ordering orange juice instead
