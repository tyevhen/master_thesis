if you 've been following along , you already know i 've been busier than i'm accustomed to at work in fact , this week i'm working full days , including saturday and the days have been full ! today was a particularly stressful day , and i just need to vent a bit , or i'm afraid i wo n't be able to sleep a wink tonight i started out in one building where i had a full morning of patients a couple hours into my day , an unscheduled outpatient walked in asking me to look at a pain in her right side i told her i could look at it , literally , but i could n't do any treatment without a doctor 's order she was quite unhappy with me i convinced the patient to sit down and rest , as she did n't look good , and i was worried unfortunately , within minutes the patient deteriorated to the point of requiring urgent medical attention despite repeatedly vomiting and dangerously staggering around the office , the patient was adamant that i not call an ambulance with help from other staff , we convinced her an ambulance was necessary , and we made the call i have no idea what happened , but i sure hope the patient is okay it was a very unexpected , tense situation the stress continued the rest of the day secondary to the sheer volume of patients we are currently treating at two different sites i spent more hours than i cared to at work the past two days i had to rush to get to my cycling class last evening , but despite rushing home tonight , i could not make it to my regular step meeting i was exhausted , and i needed to take care of jet i really could have benefited from that meeting , though my adrenaline was still running high when a friend from my recovery program called a couple of hours ago she 's new , and she asked me to help her out unfortunately , i'm worried about her after listening to her explain why she could n't do this , did n't like that , and did n't think the other was fair , i finally had to speak up i was blunt i told her i was worried about her i told her i did n't think the path she was taking was the healthiest path i told her what worked for me in early sobriety , and while i could n't tell her what to do , i did n't think she was putting forth the effort required to stay sober like i said , i was blunt but i felt i had to be i'm worried about her it turns out being blunt is also stressful through her tears , she thanked me , but i still felt guilty when i got off the phone after all , i made her cry ! i immediately called two other women in recovery i was concerned i had been mean , but they both assured me i did the right thing one of the women even told me i was fighting for my new friend 's life , and that requires directly telling the truth tell the truth i did i'm still a little revved up i'm also exhausted i'm glad i handled what was in front of me today , and i even think i handled things to the best of my ability nevertheless , i hope tomorrow is a shorter , quieter , smoother , less stressful day i hope
