whew ! i'm not used to going out for the weekend i'm still trying to recover two days later ! i feel so old ! i had a great time with my friends this weekend they had a room at one of the local casinos , so the place was quite plush and hoppin' ! after a late dinner , we went to an improv comedy show saturday night it was really fun ! it 's so enjoyable to laugh until your stomach hurts , and that 's exactly what we did the comedy show did n't start until pm that 's really late for me i'm usually asleep for a couple of hours by that time ! i have no idea what time we got back to the hotel , but i do know we chatted , ate some more , gambled a little , and stayed awake until after am ! yikes ! my friends , both of whom are several years older than i , really gave me grief about my usual routine it was all fun on sunday , we went out for a business brunch with some associates of my friends these associates happen to represent a large shoe company brooks my friends own a shoe store after the brooks reps found out i was a runner , we talked a little about my running career and guess what ? they want me to run on one of their running teams ! how cool is that ? they 'll supply me with free racing clothes and shoes , which i will then wear in races i'm incredibly honored i 'll do anything they want me to do in exchange for free gear ! so i had a really great weekend puck got spoiled by my friends , bill and cindy , while i got spoiled by my friends , mary and jim the only problem is i'm still wiped out ! and it 's nap time again
