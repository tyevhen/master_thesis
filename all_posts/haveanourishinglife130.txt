because i m fat , i can t run anymore my knees hurt i can t run as fast or as far as i used to i ve come to the conclusion that i can t run anymore because i ve gain too much weight my knees are hurting me because they can t support my fatness it s not because i ran a marathon last fall and still haven t fully recovered it s not because i tried to rollerblade the other day for the first time in years in mph wind it s not because i push myself too hard and don t know when to stop it s not because i m getting older it s not because i m still running in my marathon training shoes no i can t run anymore because i m fat i heard this story a while back a tall , lengthy basketball player got a scholarship to play for a big university the coach wanted him to bulk up , gain more weight , and build more muscle in hopes that he would be a better player the student athlete took supplements and lifted daily he achieved his goals but then started having knee problems it got so bad that he couldn t play his favorite sport anymore so he took some time off , stopped taking the supplements , stopped lifting weights , and went back to his normal schedule viola ! no more knee problems next year , he was a starter and had a lot of success because of hearing this story i am convinced that my knees hurt because i m too heavy no thing or no one is going to be able to make me believe otherwise my knees hurt because they can no longer support the weight i ve gained like the basketball player in my story if i wasn t so fat , all my problems would go away if i can t run anymore , i don t know what i m going to do i feel like i would lose part of myself if i could no longer be a runner running has been my crutch , my stress reliever , my proud accomplishment , and the only thing that can make me feel better in some situations before this happened , i wanted to get to a place , mentally , where i can enjoy exercising because it enhances the quality of my life is running the only thing , the only form of exercise , that can fulfill my need to be strong , healthy , and happy ? part of me is still holding onto the belief that , if i run a lot , i ll keep the weight off i won t let anything else replace running because , deep down in my gut , i believe running is the most effective weight loss technique i won t give anything else an honest try i won t replace running with biking or walking , even thought they might be better for me i honestly don t know what to do the only way i know how to feel better is if i run just going through the motions for the time being since i ca n't end on a negative note , i must give myself some kind of pep talk all i got today is fake it till you make it repeat on playlist
