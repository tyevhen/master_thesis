what a difficult few years it 's been , but i can proudly say that i 've gotten into university to study law which has been my lifelong ambition if you have read my blog post about my struggles with school , you 'll know that i 've missed around a year of my a levels but , i was still extremely determined to get the grades in order to get to university unfortunately , i have n't gotten into my first choice university as i did n't get the grades and they were n't going to give any leeway either and as much as i wanted to go to that uni a lot ! i still managed to get my insurance choice , so it 's still somewhere i 'd like to go i was absolutely devastated when i found that i did n't get into my first choice university , devastated and at the time , it was n't confirmed that i was into my insurance choice either , so i was very lost and angry at myself i do n't think the outcome would have mattered as much to me , if i had been at school full time without any troubles with my mental health but these last few years and my battle with anxiety has been absolute hell taking away my education and opportunities everything i loved became everything i lost i worked so hard to even step inside the school gates and to keep on going , and not doing as well as i hoped , was destroying but , what i must take from this is a greater sense of self worth i managed to get into university , which a few months back would 've been impossible , let alone taking my a levels it would 've been completely out of the question i am disappointed , but i must be proud of the fact that i can say that i could n't have worked any harder and that these are my results at the end of it if i did n't work as a hard , i would n't be where i am i must put into retrospect that my grades are good considering my attendance not only that , but i must n't be as hard on myself not everyone can be the best all of the time i 've always been seen as a bright and hard working student , and as my anxiety got hold , my grades began to drop and i began to lose the very thing i was really passionate about making me feel stupid as hard as that is , i am where i am and i am who i am no matter what the hardships , i know my triumphs and that is what i must hold dear , no matter of others opinions at the end of the day , life does n't always go to plan and you may feel you have n't got the justice you deserve , but it 's something you have to grow with and sometimes that may be for the better it 's time to begin the next chapter of my life i am both excited and terrified i hope you will all follow the journey with me ! and would you believe it , i'm currently writing this blog post whilst travelling on a train by myself ! who would have thought it ? ! finally , if you 're going through a severely difficult time , keep going i was so distraught , but i held on and now i'm here something i would never have thought possible i have been where you 've been and i know what it 's like it can get better i'm proud of you ! best wishes , amy xx
