low serum cholesterol has been linked in numerous scientific papers to suicide , accidents , and violence there are a bunch more , but i'm a bit weary of linking ! this is why i write a blog , and not a peer reviewed journal anyway , no one knows to this day whether depression , violence , and suicidal risk have a metabolic byproduct of low cholesterol , or whether having low cholesterol will predispose you to suicide out of hand here 's a rather snarky editorial pointing out that fact some trials of statins with the resultant crackerjack drop in cholesterol will show no effect on suicide a statin skeptic 's favorite study , the j lit trial , showed deaths by accidents suicides increased threefold in the group with total cholesterol less than yes , the p was , but that means there is only a chance that finding did n't happen by random happenstance now , why could serum cholesterol have anything to do with the brain and depression ? good question and the first question to ask in any theory of the brain is do the peripheral levels of something have anything at all to do with the central nervous system amounts of the same thing so do serum cholesterol levels match up to relative amounts of cholesterol in the brain ? they do and cholesterol is important in the brain synapses , where brain function goes live , have to have cholesterol to form brain signaling is all about membranes , and cell membranes are constructed from fat cholesterol and the omega and fatty acids are the most important molecules in the synapse if your brain fat is significantly different from so called normal fat which i 'll go back to the hunter gatherer paradigm and say an hg 's brain is going to have the approximate fat constituents for which we are evolved , the signaling in your brain could be very different too scientific papers will call this alterations of membrane fluidity so we know that low serum cholesterol is associated with suicide , violence , and accidents another wrench in the works low serum cholesterol is also associated with low csf serotonin which is of course associated with increased violence and suicide ! these association studies are enough to make anyone give up and go boar hunting but does dietary fat intake have anything to do with depression and suicide ? remember , serum cholesterol is often a chancy thing to connect to diet , after all well , of some odd people in finland , the omega rich fish consumers had significantly less depression than abstainers , but the finding was more robust among women no one knows why in this round up of suicide attempters and an equal number of controls , there was no difference in saturated fat intake between attempters and controls , but the attempters did report lower fiber and polyunsaturated fat intake and , finally , do statins cause depression ? i 've seen statins cause or exacerbate depression several times in my clinical practice , especially in women i 've also seen them cause paranoid psychosis a couple of times twice in women and once a long time ago in a man the psychosis remitted with withdrawal of the statin very striking ! but anecdotes are n't clinical trials this brand new study shows no link , and statins actually seemed to decrease depression in elderly women this study also shows no link this study shows that chronic cholesterol depletion via statin use decreases the functioning of the serotonin a receptors in humans , by decreasing the ability of the receptor to bind to its friendly neighborhood g proteins and other binding proteins the serotonin a receptor is more highly associated with anxiety type symptoms than depression clear as mud ! but stepping back to whole health , i never like the idea of the lower the better , no matter what , which seems to be the prevailing winds of cholesterol treatment right now usually , chemicals in the body are important for something , or else they would n't be there , and typically , a u shaped curve emerges , where too little or too much cholesterol , vitamin d , omega s , immunoglobulins , you name it ! is bad for human health here 's an example of the u shaped curve from the j lit trial via hyperlipid , showing increased cardiac death at low and high serum cholesterol levels statins may have their role , but please do n't put them in the water in my opinion , adopt a whole foods , paleo style diet keep yourself in the middle of that u shaped curve for what our human systems were evolved for it may help your mood , too , especially if you are a woman who eats fish ! follow up posts low cholesterol and suicide and your brain needs cholesterol , do n't go too low
