i believe this is what they call irony in my last post i reflected on my good mood despite some intrusive thoughts just prior to that i wrote about gratitude , specifically my gratitude for a very long streak of feeling well after all , i'm coming up on two years since my last significant depression relapse until last week 's annoying , intrusive thoughts made way for more frequent and more scary intrusive thoughts by thursday the thoughts were interfering with my functioning by saturday they were paralyzing , and they dragged my mood into the gutter today i find myself marveling at the speed with which things can change what happened ? for two days , i did little to nothing at all sleep was the only thing that relieved my misery yesterday , i asked a friend to sit with me for a bit , and her visit helped get me out the door for a run it was an ugly , painful slog , but at least i was outside this morning a friend met me at the gym for a minute class i took the class , and i'm thankful i did , but since then more sleep i'm hurting right now everything looks dark and bleak , but i know that 's the depression having its way i feel rudderless , purposeless , robotic , and hopeless it 's amazing how quickly things changed this illness continues to surprise me i'm hoping and praying this is a short blip in my long streak of feeling well and i'm praying this is as low as i go
