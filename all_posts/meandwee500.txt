hello ! so , i 've been looking at myself in the mirror lately in the morning after my shower and i ca n't help but gawk at my stomach and how it protrudes out in all its glory it 's like it 's stretching out to get some sun and yells i 've finally arrived ! this is my moment dammit ! let me through , bitches ! ! sometimes i think i look so huuuuuge ! but then i remember that i'm only just getting started and i have more months of growing to do i do n't mind it it 's just strange to see on me i kind of feel like a kangaroo minus all the hopping around i 've also noticed that while i work at the computer during the day i get so overheated in my lap area and realize that my stomach is resting on my thighs part of this is from slouching in my chair , but still never had i contemplated that i would one day sweat under my belly and on top of my thighs , etc ugh at least it 's winter and degrees outside so i can chalk this up as my own personal space heater without the extreme fire hazard and since i 've been sick for weeks now , i 've now been introduced to a fun and frisky pregnancy side effect stress urinary incontinence woo ! yeah , not something people talk much about let 's just say that you add up pregnancy with a full serving of all day and night coughing and you 've got yourself a situation where you might as well buy stock on , ahem , special underwear or the like never thought it would happen to me , but is n't that what we all think ? thank god my cold is finally ending ! before you get all grossed out and yell too much information ! ! ! just remember everyone pees it 's ok and what 's a little pee amongst friends ? right ? right ? ? ! ! save you might also like it 's getting interesting reflecting mother 's day and the birth linkwithin
