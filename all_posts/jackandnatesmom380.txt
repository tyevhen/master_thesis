totally forgot that nate 's special educator was doing a home visit today we had to reschedule during the power outage last week good thing i never leave the house ! i often dread these visits because i do n't know what i am going to witness i get a sheet about what nate is doing every single day from aba so i guess i should know in theory but nate has a different aide working with him daily they rotate and he performs differently for each one depending on how they interact with him , his mood , the tasks presented to him , etc so sometimes when kristen comes to the house nate is spot on with his aba tasks , and sometimes it is really rough i was worried when she got here because he was outside playing with his water table , and he was not going to want to come in but he actually did so pretty pleasantly , and of course went right to the table when kristen said nathan come here yeah , i would get a look and daccchhh if i requested that i am mom , i get the crap , haha today was a good day he completed almost all tasks , and the one he did n't complete was more a matter of him being and being done for the day , it was something i have seen him do before , and know that he is capable of here are his tasks matching objects field of different objects set out and one object handed to him at a time to match has to scan for the right one got them all right ! stacking cups in increasing sizes check shape sorter different shapes check piece puzzle check peg board placing pegs in a hole he would n't complete this , started throwing the pegs and screaming done i recognize these tasks are more appropriate for a child that is about months old here is mommy 's recent development and i am very proud of this by the way do n't care ! i am so stinking proud when he accomplishes these goals ! i said to kristen today he is my little genius ! it really is true that these small accomplishments mean so much more with him he works so hard to reach these goals and i can literally see his little mind working overtime when he does them i am very proud of my little boy ! then , when she told him all done he looked at me and said go out and walked to the door ok , maybe it 's cheesy , but just telling the story brings tears to my eyes my boy ! ! !
