this week i did not attend a recovery meeting because it was canceled due to the memorial day holiday i was a bit disappointed , as i like the fellowship of being around people who understand me and my fears so this week i ve spent a lot of time reading mental health through will training the recovery bible this got me thinking about the importance of taking a proactive approach to fear and anxiety problems we suffer for so long that when we find moments of relief , the last thing we want to do is read about how to get better see my shelfari shelf on this page or talk to people about our issues but ironically that is indeed what we need to do i m not saying we should analyze our problems in fact , a recovery principle is that to talk it up is to work it up but we do need to make our mental health our top priority another recovery principle this one more abstract mental health is a business , not a game and i m finding that socializing with people like me is an important way to boost my confidence in my ability to get better
