welcome to week three of my diary series , my week as i am writing them started on saturday th march if you re not sure what this is all about then see my welcome to the diary series here life and blogging i attended my first bloggers event on saturday i had a wonderful time , met some lovely bloggers and had some yummy food , see my post on the event here i think the social side of blogging is going to be a lot of fun and very good for me attending certainly helped me face fears and is very in keeping with my plans to be the best version of kelly i have often been an excuse maker and said no to many opportunities , especially social ones , i don t want to do that anymore i need to make my response more often be yes hence why i accepted a mad exercise based challenge , see all about that here this is my third blog post of the week and my th ever , i m really pleased i am managing to get out three posts a week the first this week was a recipe post , here the second was me voicing on my thoughts on possible links between my physical and mental health i shared the post in some cfs facebook groups sadly , many sufferers took great offense i understand , they have spent years facing prejudice from people who insist cfs must all in your head and not a real physical condition i have faced those thoughts myself let me tell you now , i know cfs is a physical condition with very physical symptoms i simply wrote about my feelings that , in my case , stress makes my cfs worse and possibly years of emotional strain on my body even caused me to get cfs it s a personal opinion based purely on my experience i felt so sorry and sad these people had misunderstood me they took it so badly i was banned from the group and i felt so bad i had upset people it left me in tears my most exciting blogging news this week is that i was contacted by bbc radio leicester and asked to appear on a show next week ! ! ! i still can t quite get my head around it ! my first instinct was to say no way my head ran through all these thoughts they surely must think i m something i m not ? i m not good enough to be on the radio no one will be interested in what i have to say i ll be too nervous and out of my depth i ll freeze or say something stupid or inappropriate or controversial then my sister pointed out that i must say yes as saying no would go against everything my blog stands for i couldn t argue with that nor with my friend who said they wouldn t have asked me if they didn t think i d be suitable and good enough basically , i will feature in an hour slot with the host and another guest we will discuss some light hearted articles from the past week s media sounds easy enough , right ? i feel sick just thinking about it ! i also feel excited , i can t help it ! i want to do this i m not telling you the day or time though , i m not quite that brave yet health prepare for tmi too much info this week was that time of the month for me yes , i just said that publicly for me it always makes my mood and cfs worse i ve not done too badly this week considering my exercise has been pretty much non existent and mainly consisted of normal mum type activities , school runs and housework etc beyond that , walking locally and across derby was as good as it got ! oops diet wise , i gave myself a day off on saturday so i could enjoy the offerings at the bloggers brunch the problem with me is once i cheat for a day i struggle to get back on track i did ok in that most days i still only had one cheat , they were just bad cheats can i acceptably blame that on my time of the month too ? i think i am probably eating too many potatoes too ? what i ate for each day , i have listed my breakfast , lunch , dinner , snacks and cheats some cheats might not seem too bad , if you read my diet rules you will understand why they are cheats this week mainly they are bad though ! you ll notice repetition as i make everything from scratch so always try and make extra for another day saturday b green smoothie recipe here l see bloggers brunch post d nachos s none ish lol c everything after the smoothie ! sunday b scrambled eggs , ham and tomatoes l bolognaise sauce and brown rice pasta d chicken , salad , sweet potato wedges , hummus and pumpkin seeds s cadburys cr me egg c i think that s obvious ! ! monday b none i never miss breakfast but just wasn t hungry l pate on toast and salad d roast chicken , potatoes , vegetables and yorkshire pudding s none c toast and yorkshire pudding tuesday b green smoothie recipe here l chicken , salad , hummus and hazelnuts d cajun burger , swede and carrot mash and green beans s none c none whoop wednesday b porridge with a banana , coconut oil , almond butter and almond flakes l chilli , rice and guacamole d a bag of crisps don t judge , they were being sold for charity at brownies ! s none c the crisps thursday b green smoothie recipe here l chicken with a sweet potato and chickpea stew recipe from the deliciously ella app d ham , eggs , salad , new potatoes and hummus s a cadburys wispa c embarrassed face emoji needed here friday b natural yogurt and granola recipe here l cauliflower and brown rice with a sweet potato and chickpea stew d steak , potato wedges , tomatoes and peas s none c whiskey and coke so bad goals for next week radio show success blog posts more conventional exercise less diet cheats remember to come back for next week s diary if you don t want to miss one , then subscribe to the blog by email thank you kelly x suggested posts week one diary week two diary
