i hope everyone had a wonderful holiday ! we 've been busy brining , basting , baking , eating , and visiting with family sad to go back to the daily routine in today 's ny times magazine the ethicist entertains the question of whether it 's okay for a psychiatrist to lie to keep his clientele ! i am a psychiatrist who happens to be an atheist occasionally a patient asks me what religion i follow and , displeased by my answer , seeks another psychiatrist i am a physician , not a priest religious beliefs seem as relevant to my profession as they are to an accountant s nevertheless , candor sometimes costs me a patient may i claim a belief in god to avoid damage to my credibility and business ? vaidyanath iyer , the woodlands , tex if you want the ethicist 's answer , check out the column here i think that most of us would agree that it 's not okay to lie with the intention of keeping business what if a patient asks how long you 've been practicing , and your sense is that the patient wants an experienced psychiatrist would it be okay to say years , rather than year ? clearly not personal questions can be awkward , however in traditional psychodynamic therapy , the therapist does n't answer personal questions the blank screen is necessary for the treatment , and the meaning behind the question is explored this can be very off putting to some patients , and for myself , i find that it feels disingenuous , and i prefer to simply answer questions it helps that i do n't get many questions do you have children is the most common , i 've been asked my religion a couple of times , if i have a dog yes , two , would you like one ? here and there , i 've been asked rather unusual questions do i have a cook ? who has a cook ? no , but i 'd like one ! it seems to me that if something like this is essential to the patient 's comfort level , then they should ask this on the phone before the first session does it all matter ? who knows they make good therapists in all shapes and sizes and the interpersonal fit often is found in the least expected place and my guess is that the ability to accurately diagnose and treat a mental illness has relatively little to do with any of these matters probably people are more picky about the personal lives of their shrinks than their brain surgeons , but maybe they should n't be related posts self disclosure and being genuine a shrink like me
