i'm feeling a little guilty today i was asked by my local nami national alliance on mental illness chapter to assist with an upcoming week course i am a trained instructor for nami 's professional provider class it is a course for professional health care providers taught by people with mental illness and their families it 's a very cool class , and it routinely gets rave reviews from its participants when i was asked to be one of the four teachers , i immediately wanted to do it the chance to teach mental health professionals , some of whom have likely treated me in the past , has always been one of my goals i wanted to say , yes , i 'll do it , but my gut was telling me no , do n't i typically listen to my gut i sat on the decision as long as i could when last week i was asked for my final decision , i listened to my gut 's hesitation , and i said no it was the ten week commitment , i think three hours , one night per week , for ten weeks , is quite a commitment bottom line , i was worried it would be too much now i feel guilty that i let my worry i e fear get in the way of supporting my local nami chapter i care about nami i care about this class i 've been feeling well lately why could n't i commit ? why could n't i push a bit out of my comfort zone on this one ? my gut told me no , do n't do it , but now i feel guilty i feel i 've let people , including myself , down ick ! what 's done is done , but now i'm questioning if i did the right thing and feeling a little guilty
