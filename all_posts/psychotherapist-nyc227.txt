as a psychotherapist in nyc , i see many clients who come to therapy because they feel overburdened by their loved one 's problems often , they 're the ones who everyone relies on , and they come to therapy when they feel exhausted from other people 's problems how to stop being the rescuer in your family but often what they do n't realize is that they 're participating in this codependent dynamic with their loved ones because they 're invested in being the rescuer and they 're unable to set boundaries with their loved ones see my article assertiveness learning to say no it 's not unusual for this pattern to start early in life it does n't seem to matter if this person is the oldest , the youngest or the middle child early on , they become the ones that everyone turns to when they 're in trouble , and they become accustomed to this role until it becomes overwhelming the following vignette is a fictionalized example , which represents many different cases where the client is the rescuer in her family of origin until she feels feels overburdened by this role nina nina was the middle child of five children in a chaotic family since nina 's father was often away as an interstate trucker , her mother was left to take care of the children and manage the household of all the children , nina was closest child to her mother at the end of the day , when the younger children were put to bed and the older children were watching tv , nina would sit with her mother and at the kitchen table and listen to her mother 's complaints she was tired she was worried about her elderly mother 's health she did n't know how she was going to manage the bills and so on nina would listen quietly then , she would try to come up with solutions to her mother 's problems afterwards , her mother would praise her for being mother 's little helper , which made nina feel good see my article role reversal in mother daughter relationships and ambivalence and codependency in mother daughter relationships how to stop being the rescuer in your family of origin whenever nina was upset about anything , she mostly kept it to herself because she knew that her mother was already overwhelmed and she did n't want to bother her sometimes , she talked to her older sister , but this was rare more often than not , nina 's siblings , both younger and older , turned to her for help this dynamic continued into adulthood with nina being the one who attempted to rescue her mother and her siblings she would listen to their complaints for hours and try to come up with solutions for them sometimes , she also bailed them out financially , even when it meant sacrificing things that she needed for herself by the time nina was in her early s , she was exhausted from trying to rescue her mother and siblings over and over again their problems seemed endless no sooner would she help them to overcome one problem than they developed another problem she loved her family very much , and she wanted only the best for them , but she did n't know how to deal with her increasing exhaustion during a rare time when nina confided in a friend , her friend told her that she thought nina was part of the problem because she did n't know how to set boundaries with her family she suggested that nina get help in therapy nina was shocked to hear her friend say this she never thought of getting help for herself she always thought it was her family members who needed help not her but not knowing what else to do , she decided to give therapy a try initially , nina had a hard time focusing on herself in therapy she felt more comfortable talking about her family member 's problems so , it took a while for her to be able focus on herself and to get in touch with what she was feeling she knew that she felt overwhelmed in a general sense but she was so unaccustomed to think about what was going on with her that , at first , she felt selfish for thinking about herself she also felt guilty for complaining about her family members see my article overcoming the guilt you feel for not being able to solve your parent 's problems gradually , nina came to see that she was caught in a dynamic with her family that she was actively participating in she saw that it was n't something that was happening to her she was an active participant how to stop being the rescuer in your family of origin she also began to see another underlying dynamic about herself that she had n't seen before aside from wanting to be helpful , whenever she helped her family members with their problems , she felt like she was in control and , to a certain extent , omnipotent looking back on her chaotic childhood , nina was able to see why , as a young child , she would want to feel in control and powerful in a household that often felt out of control but as an adult , her life was no longer out of control , and she was ready to give up whatever feelings of omnipotence she still felt in order to gain peace of mind over time , nina learned in therapy how to set limits with her mother and siblings it was n't easy and , initially , her family resented this change but , gradually , nina felt how much healthier it was for her to focus on herself first instead of being in the role of a rescuer she also saw that her mother and siblings were able to solve their own problems if she did n't jump in to rescue them , and they felt better about themselves because of this see my article overcoming the confusion between compassion and responsibility nina also worked in therapy to deal with her own unmet childhood emotional needs that she suppressed in order to be the parentified child to her mother and her siblings see my article what is childhood emotional neglect ? conclusion whenever there 's an ongoing dynamic between rescuer and rescuee , both people are participating in this dynamic how to stop being the rescuer in your family of origin on the surface , it might look like the rescuee is the only one who perpetuates this dynamic but , on closer inspection , it becomes clearer that this codependent dynamic would n't continue without both people actively participating since the role of rescuer often begins at a young age , it 's often difficult to change the rescuer often feels guilty and selfish , and the rescuee often feels letdown and betrayed by any attempts to change the situation during the early stages of trying to change this dynamic , the rescuer is often tempted to revert back to what is familiar because attempts at changing the dynamic can feel like swimming against the tide some people never get out of the role of being the rescuer , even though they 're exhausted from it and feel increasingly resentful getting help in therapy if you recognize yourself as being in the rescuer role for loved ones and you 've been unable to change this dynamic on your own , you could benefit from seeking help from a licensed mental health professional who has experience helping clients to overcome this dynamic not only will you be helping yourself , you 'll also be helping your loved ones to see that they can solve their problems without being dependent
