a while ago ty brought up the possibility of going on a road trip this summer , and initially i dismissed the idea it would need money i did n't have , and a month long road trip is a pretty big thing ! but lately , when the idea was brought up again , i actually thought about it , and realized that all i usually do is dream about things but never put them into action i really want to travel this is an opportunity to do just that why on earth should i pass that opportunity up ? so i 've decided that i really do want to make this work we 'll try and get together four to six of us , including me and ty , find a vehicle we can borrow , and take off wherever the mood takes us now i finally have a compelling reason to get a job ! which means i'm going to go to the job finding place tomorrow or the next day , and start asking around i 've got tons of ideas bouncing around in my head right now for how to make things work thinking of where with whom we could stay , where we could go , what we could see , and how much money i need to make as you can quite probably tell , i'm excited about this i like having goals to work towards they make working at all tolerable ! p peace , idzie you might also like back home from a wonderful trip to boston ! cottage photos overview of the northeast unschooling conference ! going to gasp linkwithin
