for as good as i was feeling in the last post , this one is equally opposite i ve now reached that wonderful pregnancy stage where my thighs rub together when i walk it irritates the skin and makes it uncomfortable , to say the least i know it s nothing major , but this experience is challenging my ability to keep my hormonal emotions under control in short , i can t stand it when i take walks , it makes me so mad that i want to break things , throw things as hard as i can , or smash something into the wall it even makes want to hurt myself i get so irritated that i could rip off my skin eventually the irrational anger turns into sadness my anger makes me so sad that i could just cry and cry in fact , if i am alone , i do cry a lot it s a constant reminder to me that my body is growing and it s not going to stop anytime soon i m only going to get bigger and my clothes smaller i want to walk to get exercise part of me feels like i have to walk because i can t do any other form of exercise right now and , i feel like i have to exercise what would happen if i didn t exercise ? i am too afraid to find out i already don t exercise as much as i want to i miss running the repetitive , rhythmic workout , turning over until i m exhausted it is as much of a stress reliever as anything having my thighs rub together is just one thing that can make me irrationally upset these days , it seems as if the littlest things shake my peace and calm part of the emotion is from pregnancy hormones but , i know part of the problem is lingering eating disorder thoughts i am having a difficult time with my changing body i am having a difficult time giving up controlling what i look like having a baby requires you to give up control of a lot things the way i look , a clean house , alone time , uninterrupted sleep are just a few examples sometimes , i feel really guilty because i don t want to be pregnant anymore i question myself and wonder why i wished for this and prayed so hard to be able to have a baby i feel like there s no way i can handle raising a child i have a hard enough time trying to take care of myself as it is i feel extremely inadequate and undeserving the only thing i can do to get through these tough feelings is to tell myself that it will pass these miserable feelings will go away and be replaced with better , happier ones in the future though , i only half believe it i say it will pass in hopes that it will pass but will it ? will it go away ? i don t really know for sure i feel like i have no control over these feelings however , reminding myself that i will feel better soon helps me living in the moment , one day at a time just do what i can do today and think about tomorrow when tomorrow gets here just because i feel crappy today doesn t mean i ll feel the same tomorrow something else that i find helpful is remembering this article i read a while back my friend introduced me to this blog and i really get a lot out of everything i read from it i highly recommend it this one post in particular has stuck with me it s called rethinking the physical pain of parenting even though i m not in the troughs of parenting , the message is still very relevant to anyone who is trying to live a life of mortification not in the sense of embarrassment , but in the sense of dying to oneself so that christ can live this emotional suffering that i am experiencing right now is part of the sacrifices of being a mom this is certainly not the last time i am going to suffer , and not the last time i don t feel up for the task right now , my imperfect body shape , my limited ability to exercise , and my inability to sleep comfortably are all sacrifices that i m making for this child inside of me i can either learn to embrace this suffering as a beautiful way to live out my vocation , or i can be miserable because i ll never get my way again in these times of trial , i need to remember that i can also offer it up i often think of offering things up when i am in physical pain , like when i have a headache or whatever but i forget that i can also offer up difficult emotions , like when i am down about how i look , or when i am irritated with everything around me god is allowing me to go through this emotional turmoil because it is helping my sanctification remembering that this type of suffering also has a purpose can help me cope with it and not fall into despair
