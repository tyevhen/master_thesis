random feelings for today nothing wrong at home , thank you very much these lyrics have been sticking with me lately for some reason people living their lives for you on tv they say they 're better than you and you agree he says hold my calls from behind those cold brick walls says come here boys , there ai n't nothing for free another doctor 's bill , a lawyer 's bill another cute cheap thrill you know you love him if you put him in your will who will save your soul when it comes to the flower ? who will save your soul after all the lies that you told , boy ? who will save your soul if you wo n't save your own ? we try to hustle them , try to bustle them , try to cuss them the cops want someone to bust down on orleans avenue another day , another dollar , another war , another tower went up , where the homeless had their homes so we pray to as many different gods as there are flowers but we call religion our friend we 're so worried about saving our souls afraid that god will take his toll that we forget to begin who will save your soul when it comes to the flower ? who will save your soul after all the lies that you told , boy ? who will save your soul if you wo n't save your own ? some are walking , some are talking , some are stalking their kill you got social security , but that does n't pay your bills there are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay so you bargain with the devil , say you 're ok for today , you say that you love them , take their money and run say it 's been swell , sweetheart , but it was just one of those things those flings , those strings you 've got to cut , so get out on the streets , girls , and bust you butts who will save your soul when it comes to the flower ? who will save your soul after all the lies that you told , boy ? who will save your soul if you wo n't save your own ?
