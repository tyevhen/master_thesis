considering i did n't taper considering i ran a tough speed workout on tuesday and considering i ran an mile tempo run on thursday , running a half marathon today was n't too bad what was bad was how difficult it was , and of course , that was totally my fault the race was a little smaller than usual , and there were apparently a lot of fast runners running i took off with the crowd , and i ran my first several miles , especially my first mile , way too fast ! that unfortunately put me in early oxygen debt , and it made the rest of the race quite difficult and a little uncomfortable discomfort be damned , i persevered my legs felt like lead , and i did n't think i could go much further by the time i hit mile eight , but fortunately or unfortunately there were a few women of about my age running near me did i mention i am slightly competitive ? so i pushed myself onward , and i did finish in front of each of them the results are n't posted yet , so i have no idea if those women were actually in my age group or not , but it was my minniature victory , nonetheless at least my competitiveness kept me moving when i wanted to stop i'm glad i pushed myself it was painful , but as usual , it only took a few minutes to forget the pain once i crossed the finish line after that , it was all socializing , commiserating , and fun it was a good day
