yes , i'm completely crackers disclosure no hairs were harmed in the production of these photos when i was younger i never imagined life without my closest friends by my sides i barely remember how those friendships began , they simply just always existed we do n't tend to foresee the breakdown of friendships , sometimes people simply drift apart and move towards other groups these transitions often feel quite natural , but at times they can be devastating and have a long lasting affect upon our lives over the years i 've had to intentionally break off friendships in my teenage years i drifted through various friendship groups , this was fairly pain free as i was n't alone in those transitions there were times when i had to break away from people as i realised some 'friends' no longer shared the same values as me at one point someone attempted to bully me into remaining loyal to them despite them behaving in ways i did n't agree with those actions were the reasons i was distancing myself from them in the first place sometimes bullies can be halfhearted , they strike out , the result of their own insecurities fortunately i was able to brush them off when i first encountered bullying my second encounter with a bully was very different they were manipulative , strategic and vicious i'm often told that i ought to pity bullies , supposedly they must have some deep issues or problems at home , they seek control through bullying in their domain at the time i did n't realise it was a form of bullying yes , it was verbal abuse which i associated with bullying however , i 'd never experienced or heard of psychological bullying , something which would affect me for the entirety of my young adult life i do n't hold onto any angry feelings towards those involved mostly i just want to know why it happened , how they could do such a thing and whether there really was something going on with them to cause the attack on me it was a hard time for me , i isolated myself and walked away from long standing friendships to avoid causing a 'choosing of sides' reflecting back upon that time , i realised that sides would n't have been chosen they were all under the thumb and believed the rumours spread about me these 'friends' ought to have known those rumours were completely out of character and could never be true i'm not one to give myself compliments or to 'talk myself up' , but i will say that i'm loyal and i care for those i know and love we do n't always anticipate change , we do n't expect having to walk away from friendships in a way , this post is a letter to my year old self , and advice to anyone experiencing similar problems currently or still allowing problems in the past to weigh upon them today there is n't much about my 'depression story' that i 'd change however , i would have walked away sooner you never need to change yourself for anyone i attempted to change and adapt to please others i used to stay out longer than i ought to at the weekend to avoid 'missing out' on the laughs , the stories and inside jokes that would be re iterated for the next week at school none of it made me happy true friends do n't seek to make you feel uncomfortable , they do n't intentionally exclude you and if they love you for who you really are they wo n't try to change you the genuine friends will stick with you throughout good and bad times long distances and lengthy periods spent apart wo n't break the bond my true friends have emerged since i started being honest about my life , the struggles and the conditions i live with this post came to mind in anticipation of an upcoming trip to durham where i attended university i'm aware that my friends from uni read my blog and that they 're supportive of it i'm glad that they now know how hard it was for me whilst i was there , and why i was n't around as much in the second year when i was really struggling i have reached out to a few of them , but its difficult to maintain contact when we have little to talk about , reaching out sometimes feels artificial i 've missed them more that they know , i cherish memories of my better days with them and value their friendships i have n't seem most of them for well over a year , a fair amount of fear comes with that amount of time apart despite that , i know that the true friends will be there to catch me if i start to wobble
