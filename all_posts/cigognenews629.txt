there is a rumor that tiger woods will check into a sex addiction center in arizona now what exactly are they going to do there ? whatever it is , it is not going to stop his sex compulsions , which seem to have dominated his life if it is the usual psychotherapy it will miss the driving force which happens to be low in the brain in brain structures which are far below the thinking structures where most current therapies work why is that ? because the force behind inordinate sex is mostly lodged in the impulse pain areas specifically in the brainstem and limbic feeling areas it isn t just a matter of addressing the sexual behavior as addressing the imprinted pain force that drives such behavior in fact , any compulsive behavior depends on two things the first is gestational trauma , birth problems , lack of early love , and other factors which sets the accelerator on high the second is life experience that channels the compulsion the reason the compulsive is out of control is because it is first and foremost an impulse driven by deep brain forces and those forces are not necessarily sex the second is that the behavior has an explosive and relieving ending one can end the impulse temporarily through orgasm explosive pain and explosive release but where does the pain come from ? we don t know him well enough to say but we do know that since the time he was a toddler he was being channeled into golf acting out the quest for perfection and fame for his father he was living out his father s needs not his own , and that spells pain even though none of the participants were aware of it any time any need is extraordinary , all else being equal , it is driven by extraordinary pain feelings if normal we all have sexual needs they get out of control when pain enters the equation that pain can radically alter the sex hormone levels just as it can change the thyroid levels and the behavior that follows is a dynamic where high levels change behavior and then that agitated behavior that keeps the hormones elevated in the case of thyroid , there can be chronic fatigue and lack of energy which keeps the person from accomplishing much down regulation that didn t happen to tiger , who accomplished a lot because his trauma produced an upregulation , that carried over into his sex life which drove him in the same way that the golf compulsion did you do not become great without an enormous drive , witness andre agassi and his life in conventional psychotherapy if the lower driving forces are not addressed , expressed and resolved , there will be no success yes , he can be taught through cognitive methods to try to control his impulses but that is usually a vain effort impulses nearly always win out because they are biologically stronger than ideas they are designed for survival and therefore must be strong in any case , there is no convincing or exhortation in the world that will change a compulsion , which i think is what happens in these so called treatment centers they usually try to put an ideational belief cap on impulses and feelings so as to reduce the sexual act outs but then where does all that energy go ? we can be sure that later there will be even more severe symptoms do those centers ever publish what they do ? based on what science ? on what theory ? are they aware of the unconscious forces at work ? if so , how do they square addressing the top level cortex without understanding the neurologic underpinnings of brainstem forces these are memories laid down while we live in the womb and during birth and infancy are the therapists satisfied with controlling the problem rather than resolving it ? that need for constant control doesn t mean that the underlying forces are not continually gnawing away adversely affecting the body and ensuring an early demise being unconscious is not a solution it is denial in a major way but one cannot deny the churning physiology that will wrack the person without cease and one day inflict a grave symptom in the body
