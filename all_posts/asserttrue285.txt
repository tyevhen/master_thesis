most genomes , whether human or bacterial , contain significant numbers of pseudogenes that is , genes that are presumed to be inactive due to internal stop codons , frameshift errors , or other serious defects the usual presumption is that such genes are dormant or dead and thus are not expressed as proteins , since the proteins would be severely truncated or contain nonsense regions , etc however , we know that in mycobacterium leprae the leprosy bacterium , some of the organism 's , pseudogenes are transcribed while most of the transcripts are no doubt used in some kind of regulatory capacity , it would be surprising if not a single transcript got translated into protein one sign that a protein gene is highly expressed is the presence , upstream of the start codon , of a strong shine dalgarno sequence this is a special sequence of bases that serves as a binding area for s ribosomal rna the shine dalgarno sequence serves to increase the translational efficiency of the genes that have such signatures not all do generally , they are found ahead of high priority highly expressed genes such as genes for ribosomal proteins absence of a sd sequence does n't mean the gene does n't get translated many genes carry no sd signal i created scripts that looked at all , pseudogenes in m leprae , to detect the occurrence of shine dalgarno sequences in the base pair region upstream of what would normally be the start codons of said genes intriguingly , of pseudogenes carry a length sd sequence nearly times the number of such sequences expected to occur by chance by comparison , of normal genes in m leprae carry a length sd sequence when i looked for length sd signals , i found that of pseudogenes carry such a signal , compared to for regular genes length signals were found for pseudogenes of the total of , pseudogenes versus normal genes representing of , normal genes these numbers are about eight times higher than expected to occur by chance these numbers are summarized in the table below , where i also show similar findings for genes and pseudogenes of bordetella pertussis organism data set motif length expected found of genes m leprae genes n sd sd sd pseudogenes n sd sd sd b pertussis genes n sd sd sd pseudogenes n sd sd sd b pertussis preserves a higher proportion of sd signals in pseudogenes than does m leprae this is expected , since most b pertussis pseudogenes are still in frame , whereas most but not all m leprae pseudogenes harbor frameshifts length or longer sd signals occur at about one third the rate in psuedogenes of m leprae that they do in normal genes of m leprae , but still much higher than expected by chance if of pseudogenes are transcribed as we know they are , and a third of those transcripts have strong enough sd sequences to facilitate translation , it means about pseudogenes in m leprae could be expected to have expressed protein products those products would , of course , be truncated and or contain nonsense regions presumably , many would be marked for proteolysis either by the tmrna system or through other mechanisms
