how do you define success ? a friend and i were discussing the concept the other day it really is the ultimate subjective question which is why i love it so much success , as society would have us believe , is larger this and more of that we really are a consumer society and many of us have been brought up to equate possessions with success also , there are vocations which seem to be indicative of success the list goes on and on suffice it to say i had pause to think about what success means to me living a meaningful life is a top priority this entails showing compassion towards others , being there for friends and family and celebrating all of the wonderful components that make up this fragile gift called life if i am able to make others happy sometime , to encourage someone to laugh , to cry with happiness , to inspire them creatively , to make themselves the best that they can be that is living a happy , successful life to me it really is amazing how wrapped up we can get in the hustle and bustle of life the unconscious voice that tells us to acquire , that owning things equals happiness it is a fruitless endeavor in the long run you ca n't take it with you , as they say material possessions are like biting into a chocolate easter bunny that is hollow on the inside outside it is sweet and tempting , but it leaves you empty and wanting something more substantial now when i say substantial i mean fulfilling to the soul , not something to put on a mantel of opulence i met some new friends today i am doing a commission for them this is one of the many joys of being a painter meeting wonderful individuals who become friends they are terrific people so generous and thoughtful sitting having tea with them behind their house made me realize how the best things in life really are free to share a meeting of minds , opinions on what makes the world go around or thwart it 's progress , these moments are ones to hold close and cherish it is times such as today that my inherent cynicism begins to abate i learn to have some faith in humanity that such lovely people are everywhere that the world is not necessarily going to hell in a hand basket my upcoming trip to salt spring island is drawing ever closer i have rented a small cottage on the ocean a beautiful place from what i have seen i plan on visiting the entire island , including the market in ganges on the saturday , ruckle provincial park and all points in between i love the idea that salt spring is an artistic mecca , with lots of working artists with open doors to their studios , ready to welcome the casual passerby i can only hope to get a few quality paintings out of the excursion from a portrait of a local baker to the profile of a nearby mountain , all make up the quality and uniqueness of that time and place pet peeve of the day people who insist on traveling at the exact posted speed limit please speed limits are posted knowing that the average person will travel kms faster than the posted number and of course , these staid drivers are always on two lane streets or roadways where overtaking them is a hassle and a hazard listening to what ever happened by the strokes what 's money ? a man is a success if he gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night and in between does what he wants to do bob dylan
