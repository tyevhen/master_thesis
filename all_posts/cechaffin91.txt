it 's come to my attention that although i extended the contest deadline until april that i had only mentioned it at facebook and not here again , to win a hardback copy of unexpected light , send one poem , preferably your best , published or unpublished with contest in the subject line to cechaffin at gmail dot com also there 's a new review in a capella zoo , short and sweet but insightful , here 's the link unexpected light our garden has started to take off and so far one delphinium was stripped by the deer but i inspected it and the root system was healthy and then i noticed three shoots coming up so i re planted it score deer , gardener also i spread iron pellets last night as i had noticed that a marigold was savaged by a banana slug this morning i found him dead by the blackberry bramble i think the marigold in question is still viable score banana slug , gardener of course the two greatest sins of gardening are overwatering and overfeeding and the three rules of gardening are location , location , location is it the same with people ? the old saw advises , bloom where you 're planted but does n't it help immensely to have the right location , the right family , the right school , the right geography and the right encouragement ? i'm so happy in mendocino that i call it home after three years and hope to live another twenty here in the same rental now would n't that be a stunt for a peripatetic guy like myself ? yes , i continue to labor to write a poem a day , skipping a few days , here 's today 's , a love poem now you have on the porch with the mendocino blue ocean before us , icelandic poppies and apricot twist and lavender striving towards summer , i long for you beside you in the car i long for you , even as i hold you in your sleep when you must be away i busy myself while your magnet draws the iron filings of my adoration it 's not like you were queen no , that 's partly it you are my worry stone , my celtic rose , my dolmen and my grail again i notice your legs , creamy and muscular , your breasts beneath the halter top , your ass wrapped in black canvas shorts , but above all your soft face telling me , you do n't have to do the laundry today , let 's spend it together that 's where i 'd rather be than anywhere , whether your coronation or me reading these few lines at carnegie hall i know the same obtains for you each morning we repeat , have i told you today that i love you ? and the refrain , now you have i think for the rest of the month i 'll write love poems only if you were to peruse my book you would see a whole section of love poems at the end , why the book is subtitled , selected poems and love poems not much more to report except that i remain rather fearful vis a vis all the mail and paperwork piled up on my desk i do n't think of winning the lottery , rather missing some arcane payment that will land me in poverty again this attitude goes back to my days as a poor married student here is another poem on that very subject my inheritance i did n't grow up poor but i fear poverty just like my parents , who lived through the depression mom hoarded rubber bands from throwaway papers and after dad died , re used dental floss when dad was doing well , financially , he super glued a loose tooth to his bridge rather than pay a dentist he was so proud until the tooth turned black you gotta make a buck , he 'd say mom sampled mystery foods from tupperware containers left in the fridge for weeks she could n't bear to throw a thing out never marry a woman who cuts the twine on packages , she 'd say , winding another orbit around her ball after his goods were stolen and children murdered , job said , what i greatly feared has come upon me what my parents feared never did instead fear drove them to plenty though they were always poor , like me published in poetry superhighway i wish there were some cure for this neurosis , and when it works , faith is the key nevertheless , even if i were rich i think i 'd be subject to the same anxiety as it 's so deeply inbred rockefeller was once asked how much he 'd need to feel comfortable just another million , he answered i should mention that my shrink , after listening to me tell him that my book was n't sellling as fast as i 'd hoped , said i hope you were n't expecting to make money off of a book of poetry that would call into question your reality testing yes , exactly ! but hope springs eternal unless you have a foam bed ka ching ! thine at kilobunny , ce
