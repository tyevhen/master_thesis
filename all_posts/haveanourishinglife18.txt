thinking about the human person and he who made us who we are we are made up of body , mind , and spirit i think i could get a couple of people to agree with me there as a catholic , we mean the same thing , we just have a little different language for it in his great mercy , god gave us each of these capacities a body , or the flesh that will rise again and live forever in heaven or hell , an intellect , and a will after original sin , we , as human beings , were no longer working in harmony as one body , mind , and soul together from personal experience , i can attest to the disunity the body goes against the mind , being obstinate to what we want to do the mind goes against the spirit my heart is telling me one thing and my mind is telling me another and the spirit is sometimes trapped in a broken body but god brings about good from every situation he does not waste one second of suffering , but uses each and every situation to effect good , whether or not we realize it or see the results in this life so , i was thinking about all three faculties of the human person and wondering how they all fit into god 's plan for my life he did n't create us to be in constant disharmony , but he created us for peace and happiness i know my spirit is weak i often feel very betrayed by my emotions i 've learned to not trust my feelings all the time my feelings come and go like the weather and i have little or no control over them my mind sometimes fails me too i doubt , over analyze , worry , doubt some more , question , assume , etcetera , etcetera what do i do , then , when both my soul and my mind are working against my greater good ? i think this may be why habits are so important duh ! you say well , i'm a slow learner my body goes through habits and rituals each day i wake up , i check my phone to see the time , i get up , i bless myself with holy water , i make my bed , and , my favorite part , i drink a cup of highly caffeinated , deliciously sweetened , perfectly brewed coffee i hardly think about this things anymore my body just goes through the motions with my mind and soul barely even being present i used to think these kind of actions were n't good i thought i had to present for every moment but , i'm thinking differently now perhaps , our mindless habits are our saving grace perhaps , they are a good thing that god gave us to help us overcome the disunity of our self we should use the times of a joyful spirit , when our hearts feel the love of god , to establish a solid , realistic , prayer routine so , when the time comes , because it will come , when we have dark nights of the soul and our mind is full of doubt , we can trust our bodies to carry us through the motions , even if our hearts are n't fully present then , when the time comes , because it will come , when we feel consolations again and feel the peace of the lord , we have n't gone astray but have tried our hardest to keep on running the race i sense this is how we form a deep and lasting friendship with our lord , instead of just starting over again and again when i have a healthy mind , when i rejoice in the lord and i am thankful for his good works in my life , i 'll try to establish a habit of positive thinking and , even still , i 'll work on the habit of praying and ordering my whole life to serve god in whatever way he calls me to do can i get a true freedom ! ! ! ? oh , do n't get me started on the meaning of freedom another time , another time where was i ? alas ! when times are good , i am always tempted to skip prayer and forget about god why ? because i do n't feel like i need him ? because i'm too confident in my own abilities ? because i'm too distracted with making my life here comfortable ? d all of the above something like , the squeaky wheel gets the oil , or whatever that saying is if my internal strife is not loudly beckoning me to do something , the noise of everything else seem more important my kids screaming , the piles of dishes by the sink , my frizzy hair i'm a slave to whatever seems most important at the time , whatever is the loudest hmmm
