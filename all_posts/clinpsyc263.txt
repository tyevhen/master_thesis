attacking the small problems whilst the larger villainy remains uninvestigated and unpunished that 's what the british regulatory agencies seem to be doing , to paraphrase a recent post from dr aubrey blumsohn to that , i say trudat here 's a snippet the emphasis on decorum and status explains why the bbc had to conduct it 's own investigation link of the worrying events surrounding clinical trials of the drug seroxat and the company glaxosmithkline gsk as the medicines regulator the mhra simply dragged it 's feet for years conducting an internal investigation of its own collusion with the deception and to cap it all , key figures within the mhra are previous employees of gsk blumsohn points out that there sure is a lot of emphasis on style i e , oh , be nice and proper as opposed to substance um , this drug can be dangerous or this professor is getting railroaded by the administration , etc also , those in the highest roles of authority prestige are off limits they can do whatever they want without consequence do read his entire post it 's well worth your time
