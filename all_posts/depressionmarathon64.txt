i am humbled and grateful once again to be honored by healthline com for having one of the best depression blogs considering how many depression blogs are out there , and they only chose a few , i am proud my tiny little space was recognized for quality of content and for educating , inspiring , and empowering readers what more can i say than that ? thank you , healthline i appreciate the honor speaking of honors , i have decided to submit an application to the twin cities marathon sponsor , medtronic , to become one of their global champions , and you may be able to help medtronic is selecting marathon runners who use an eligible medical device , or have had a medical procedure or therapy to their medtronic global champions team they are looking for inspirational stories from runners to share with the world to qualify as a global champion the medronic website states , if you are a runner and have overcome medical conditions such as heart disease , stroke , diabetes , cancer , chronic pain , neurological disorders , obesity , or gastrointestinal and urological disorders and have returned to an active life with the help of medical technology or solutions , inspire others and share your story apply to be on the medtronic global champions team i could n't help but notice mental illness was not specifically included in their list however , medtronic says of a global champion , with grit and determination , they re ready to show the world that life with a medical device or procedure won t stand in their way of pursuing their goals and passions i think that 's me , and i think recovering from my depression relapse via transcranial magnetic stimulation qualifies that 's right i think i'm recovering from this unbelievably horrible , despair filled depression relapse the tms really seems to be working i almost ca n't believe it ten long weeks of hopelessness and misery seems to be abating today my coworkers could n't stop enthusiastically telling me how different i am today compared to just last week like night and day , to quote one of my assistants likewise , during a phone call , my psychiatrist 's nurse made several comments about how much better i sounded i kind of wish i had a video recording of what i looked and sounded like these past weeks apparently , i 've already made a huge recovery i'm so relieved to be feeling better thank god for tms
