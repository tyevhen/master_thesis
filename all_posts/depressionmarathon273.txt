i had a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth from the chicago marathon last sunday , so yesterday i signed up to run another half marathon today i ran the mankato half marathon , which was about minutes from my home , this morning i wanted to run one more time before my hip surgery , tuesday , sidelines me for the next three months and i wanted to run well , up to my potential , which i failed to do in chicago my goals this morning were similar to chicago , run the entire race and finish feeling strong i started conservatively , following my friend therese , who was pacing the crowd mile i had to combat negative thinking through those early miles , as usual , as we traversed some rolling hills and ran into a significant headwind but by mile five , the pace felt too relaxed and i soon found myself passing therese and heading off on my own i still was n't sure what to expect , but before long i found myself at mile ten feeling fairly good i knew with only k left i would definitely finish , and i picked up the pace the last three miles were tough i was pushing hard , racing , and it felt good i do love to race within the last two miles , i dropped three women i had been dueling with for several miles that was fun i finished audibly huffing , but strong , around mile it was fun to race i was happy to meet both of my goals it makes going into surgery in two days a bit more palatable , though i'm still dreading not being able to run for three months actually , i'm a little worried about the next three months running is so much a part of my life it keeps me balanced and mentally healthy i am really going to have to work hard to maintain my physical fitness while i'm recovering , otherwise my mental health will be in jeopardy i hope i can stay motivated to swim and bike for the next three months my other concern with surgery is , of course , financial besides running , i am not allowed to jump or squat for three months either jumping should n't be an issue , but as a physical therapist i repeatedly squat all day long at work at this point i'm not sure how i'm going to work effectively without squatting and since i do n't have any vacation benefits , the missed work is going to hurt i'm hoping to figure out how to work without squatting , but i 'll likely still miss many days paying the bills will be a challenge things have a way of working out sometimes , and i'm praying this is one of those times i 'll have to trust in my higher power on this one
