i ve mentioned this theme earlier pharmagossip and merrill goozner , among others have been banging this drum for much longer than i the problem is that , on one hand pharmaceutical companies bemoan the allegedly huge costs of research and development on the other hand , there have been a lack of innovative developments for example , the fda has now approved invega as a treatment for schizophrenia the active ingredient ? although the drug contains an active substance never before approved by the fda , that substance is an active metabolite of an old drug , the atypical antipsychotic risperdal risperidone , which is marketed for treating schizophrenia who developed invega ? janssen , which also developed and markets risperdal not coincidentally , risperdal will soon be going off patent so , as generic competition swoops in , janssen wants to keep its patients on its high cost med , which , of course , is now switching from risperdal to invega are there likely to be clinical advantages for invega over risperdal ? nope it s too similar to risperdal to expect any notable differences so , scientifically , it would have of course made better sense to develop something different , but this ain t about science or benefiting patients
