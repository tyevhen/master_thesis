so the fatigue i 've felt over the past week was at least partly of my own creation , i think i forgot my meds on multiple occasions here 's the thing i was doing so well i was feeling maybe the best i 've felt in several years i was feeling normal , not too high nor too low i had enough energy to make it through my day , but not so much that i could n't nap when needed or sleep through the night my thoughts were relatively clear not intrusive , negative , or jumbled i was feeling good i figured all of the fine self care i was doing yoga , sleep , mindful eating , meditation all of that would protect me i allowed myself to go there maybe , just maybe , i could be normal i'm not normal i'm still sick i still have a chronic illness a biological , treatable illness but an illness , nonetheless taking good care of myself while taking my meds lessened my symptoms and made life easier , but once i practically discontinued my meds , my symptoms returned i'm disappointed i'm humbled and i'm smarter i 'd become increasingly resistant to taking my meds recently no particular reason i just did n't want to be sick i guess you could call this my 'am i normal' experiment i received valuable information from this experiment less resistance and more acceptance that 's where i'm at today as the big book of aa notes , acceptance was the answer i have depression it 's an illness i'm doing well and i need my medication to continue doing well humbling reality acceptance
