question as i practice , how to i keep from feeling like i am under constant threat of thoughts ? i have this general i am not safe feeling like i must be on alert at all times for the negative thoughts and therefore i ca n't relax answer the thought pattern i am not safe has become a strong one for you because as you think a thought over and over it becomes dominant but just because a thought pattern is strong in your brain does not mean that the thought has any basis in reality in reality you are safe your thoughts have no power over you you can always think any thought you want to think , ca n't you ? hippoty hop replace the thought i am not safe with the thought i am safe in this moment whenever the thought i am not safe occurs , replace it with i am safe in this moment and then relax your shoulders at the same time when your body takes a fearful position , just relaxing out of the fearful position helps to lessen the fear you always have the power over your own brain to think any thought you want to think fear is just a thought you can replace fear with a nonsense thought or some other more productive or objective thought any time the fear thought comes up you fear bank is full because you keep investing in fear thoughts your safe bank will fill up as you invest it with more i am safe thoughts a b curtiss
