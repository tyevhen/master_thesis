i 've been a total slug today that is , i 've been a total slug since returning home around am after running my second half marathon in the last seven days i raced last saturday morning in madison , wisconsin this morning , exactly days since the gun went off in madison , i toed the starting line in downtown rochester wise ? probably not scheduled to do a miler today , anyway , i decided to join the crowd at my local half marathon i began by slowly running the mile from my home to the race start as a warm up i planned , out loud , to do this half marathon not as a race , but as my training run , albeit a little faster than normal training pace i thought i could probably comfortably handle to pace and then run a relaxed cool down home afterward i actually did stick to my plan i went through the first miles at exactly pace we hit the highlight of the course , a long , long , constantly climbing , fairly steep hill shortly thereafter it hurt it hurt everyone i actually passed many people on the way to the top , which was nice , but my legs never fully recovered for the rest of the race and that 's when i should have changed the plan instead , i stuck to it by sticking to the plan , i ended up racing the rest of the course that is , even though i stuck to my plan to run around minutes per mile , minutes per mile was no longer a comfortable pace it was racing pace i really do n't think i could have run any faster so my training run turned into a race , and by the end i was wiped out ! ironically , i finished in , and guess what ? that 's an per mile pace like i said , i did stick to the plan sometimes the wiser course of action is to alter , rather than stick to the plan ! hopefully learning has occurred , but i doubt it ! i spent the rest of today recovering i ate a delicious , way to big burger and fries after the race and i spent the rest my time , i e all day , stretched out in bed , curled up on the sofa , or sitting in my recliner doing absolutely nothing well , i did drive minutes to the grocery store about an hour ago , as i needed some ice cream and chocolate syrup ! it 's been a non productive , sleepy , fattening day so much for that damn plan ! actually , it 's not so bad i 've accepted being a sloth today i have to work tomorrow , so i know i 'll not carry my sluggishness into another day i 'll remember this lesson if and when a similar situation arises in the future , but knowing me , i may overdo it again anyway oh well i do enjoy challenging myself , even if it is n't always the brightest thing to do
