we are always told that no one is perfect , and this is true but , it 's hard to believe when you end up comparing yourself with someone else who seems to have everything going for them but , it 's important to remind yourself that you are comparing your behind the scenes with everyone else 's show reel even though i know perfection does n't exist , i still strive for it this can be both good and bad and in theory i should achieve better outcomes , but it 's always more detrimental to my mental health i found that the day i moved to university , my happiness had reached a new level and as time moves on , i begin to experience happiness something which i have n't experienced in many , many years and it 's the most wonderful feeling currently , i still feel blessed and i can honestly say i am happy even though my happiness is tainted sometimes and my mental health can be a struggle something , which i expected and what i am struggling with currently i know that just because we change or try something new , does n't mean that our mental health and other issues are n't going to follow us but , it 's hard to remind ourselves of that i 've found that experiencing happiness that i have missed for so long , hurts when it gets tainted and i end up losing my balance with my mental health questions whir around my head about others and i get scared , because i 've been in the darkest depths and there is no way in hell , that i ever want to go back but , you and i both must remind ourselves of this everybody in life has their own journey and we are all different what we see on the outside , is never what 's going on the inside recovery is about progress , and when we have times when we wobble and our mental illness comes back to haunt us we worry we are scared that we will never escape but , it 's important to hold on and remember how far you 've come only a couple of years ago , i could n't leave the house and now i am living independently we all have our achievements and yes , i have questions as to why has this happened to me ? , why do i have to do a double take on every action ? , why is it me ? it angers me so much , but as much as that can trouble me , this is it this is me and i find that i now have a greater depth of the world as a result i find that , just because we wobble does n't mean we are going to go back each relapse , makes you stronger and even though you question , how many times can i come out of this alive ? and as tired as you are , as much as you feel things are n't perfect , and as much as you feel things are slipping no one is happy all of the time but , perhaps you hold onto happiness more tightly than others , because you know that pain can be around the corner but , as unfair as it is , you are strong and capable to get through it and taking time out is okay , because sometimes , it can all get too much you 've done it before and you can do it again remember , no one is perfect best wishes , amy xx
