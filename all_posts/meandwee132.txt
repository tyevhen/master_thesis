with all the political drama going on around us , it makes me stop and wonder do we need to put the burden of change only on our politicians ? i am asking myself am i doing enough to help others ? can i contribute to good things in my own community ? how can my family and children help make a difference ? what am i passionate about ? what really matters ? should n't we all ask ourselves these questions and try to answer them ? we need to be responsible in our own lives and in our own communities it 's on all of us to show up that being said , i'm remembering the simple things in life and what matters most to me more to come ! make gifs save you might also like how to entertain your children in summer what to do about blogger envy simple ideas linkwithin
