if you 're a regular here , you may have already noticed a few additions to my site with the kind assistance of blog angel 's very informative three part series on plagiarism , i was able to add several protections to my site these protections do n't guarantee that another idiot wo n't scrape my material again , but hopefully i 've taken steps to make it a little more difficult i spent three hours this morning researching and then applying these steps first , i finally got myself a creative commons license which delineates exactly what others can and ca n't do with my work then i added my blog to my free copyright com my free copyright is a free service where you can register your blog once registered , my free copyright uses my feed to create a digital fingerprint of my content and e mails it back to me by doing this , i have a third party dating and time stamping my original content i'm not a techie , so i suggest you check out the site for a much better explanation ! lastly , i began using a service called tynt insight tynt insight automatically adds a link back to my original content with every paste as i understand it , if somebody copies and pastes material from this blog into their own sham blog , my material will be linked back to my blog , which identifies me as the author sounds too cool to work , does n't it ? i'm amazed what people can do with computer code ! so that 's it that 's what i 've done so far hopefully , these steps will protect me from having to deal with unethical jerks again !
