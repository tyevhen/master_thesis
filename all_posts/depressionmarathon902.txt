i stepped out of my comfort zone and went caroling tonight with members of my track club it 's an annual event i 've never attended before first of all i ca n't sing ! secondly , it 's one of those group activities , and i knew i would n't know many of the runners attending i think about fifteen runners showed up we began at the local running store and then ran around town wearing our santa hats and reindeer antlers we entertained the residents at two nursing homes and then stopped to sing to the kids at the ronald mcdonald house we completed our journey by returning to the running store for cookies it was fun it was fun , but it was also dark and freezing cold ! i would n't be surprised if it was several degrees below zero it was definitely the coldest weather i 've run in this year the darkness and the dicey winter footing was quite challenging , too after downing a few cookies , i returned home to take puck on a mile jaunt before we went out i put vaseline on his paws i was worried he might get frostbite from the cold , icy ground he seems to have survived just fine i'm pretty proud of myself for getting out of the house tonight there were many reasons for me not to go i was exhausted after work it was freezing cold and dark outside it was a new activity i 'd never done before , which meant i had to conquer my fear in order to go i'm not sure what got me out the door sometimes i surprise myself next year i just may do it again !
