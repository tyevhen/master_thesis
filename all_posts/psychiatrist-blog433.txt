in maryland , there is a tiered formulary for medicaid patients what this means is that the physician must try a first tier medication before a second tier medication what makes a medication a tier one medicine ? the cost some medicines are more expensive than others , and beside that , the state contracts with pharmaceutical companies for special rates so in maryland , if you want to prescribe risperdone , it 's not a problem if you want to prescribe some of the other atypical antipsychotic medications , you need to fill out a prior authorization form giving the diagnosis , the target symptoms , the name of the medicine , the dose , strength , frequency , and quantity the doc needs to check off whether it 's being continued from an inpatient setting , if there is a condition or drug interaction which prevents use of a preferred i e , cheaper medication , s he must list other medications that have been tried with their strength , frequency , dates of use , compliance at least days wk and reason for discontinuation oh and the demographics of all involved including the doc 's npi number , specialty , address , fax , email , phone , and the patient 's name , dob , address , medicaid number and height and weight and gender just a simple little form finally , at the bottom of the form , the prescriber must sign off on the following statement , i certify that the benefits of antipsychotic treatment for this patient outweigh the risks so like how does anyone know that before the patient even takes the pill ? risk benefit is an individual issue and depends on a balance of side effects and response to a medication until the pill is swallowed and perhaps until quite a few pills are swallowed , we do n't know if the patient will have side effects , or if the patient 's symptoms will even respond mind you , if the patient does n't respond to the initial dose and we to raise it , the doctor needs to fill the form out all over i think the state needs fortune tellers , not doctors
