in february i summarized my twelve month experience with taking dutasteride my fourth quarter review was not as positive as the other three quarters i also commented that i would continue to provide quarterly reviews unless something significant happened well , it has been an interesting four weeks and all good news news worth sharing my neck problems are nonexistent i was one worried guy for some time , but this last once has been wonderful free of weakness and pain my leg strength has been great these last three weeks i haven t had one bad day my arm strength the last week and a half has been better than it has been in at least nine months this was totally unexpected and very welcome you cannot believe how elated i was during my first workout i was wondering if it was just an anomaly because those of us living with kennedy s disease get them far too frequently and , yes , it might pass , but it also gives me hope living with kennedy s disease is a journey of ups and downs we need a lot of ups to help with all the downs i like to use the comment , this too will pass i use it during the good times and the not so good ones right now i am enjoying the ride and i just wanted to share the moment with you
