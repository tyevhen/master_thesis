it 's been weeks since my surgery to remove the extruded portion of my l disc , weeks since the original injury , and i'm trying my best to deal with a very slow recovery yesterday was a really tough day after attempting to increase my level of activity just a bit , i again ended up in fairly significant pain i saw my surgeon 's physician assistant , and she assured me i'm doing as expected she kept saying , it takes time patience is not one of my virtues , i guess i really expected to be further along the road to recovery by now , and i certainly did n't expect to continue having so much pain pain is discouraging and frustrating , but i did get some good news yesterday the physician assistant cleared me to begin walking for exercise , as my pain allows she also cleared me to begin gentle physical therapy strengthening exercises i still ca n't work , as i continue to have significant lifting restrictions , but i'm happy to be cleared for increased activity i just hope my pain will decrease and allow me to do what she 's now granted permission to do on another front , my date went well it was fun beautiful evening , great stadium , and our team won with a walk off home run in the bottom of the ninth inning we 'll see where things go from here we may just continue to be friends , i think , but one can never have too many friends i'm proud of myself for pushing through my fears and going out at all fear gets me nowhere courage , on the other hand , can lead to great things and i think we all deserve great things
