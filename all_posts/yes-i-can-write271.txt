i very recently discovered for myself a band called chumbawamba i thought i 'd share one of the songs from their newest album , the boy bands have won i present to you the lovely song words can save us i find it quite annoying how much talk and arguments there are to do with music what 's good music , what 's bad music , who 's sold out , who 's really political and who 's just doing it for the attention i love listening to music with a strong political message , especially if that political message is anti civ or at the very least anarchist however , i listen to music that i like listening to i'm far more concerned with how a song makes me feel than if the band has sold out or not ! so that 's my mini rant on that and just so you know , the members of chumbawamba are anarchists peace , idzie you might also like music , lovely music trips and ukuleles and anarchists , oh my ! rise against several things that make life pretty good right now linkwithin
