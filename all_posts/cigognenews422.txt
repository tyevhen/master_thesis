for therapists , what the patient says is put into context by the right so that the doctor can also read the emotional subtext of what is going on in other words , the doctor is not just listening to words but emotions the left brain needs to hear words and cannot make decisions until he hears the right words it cannot suss out what is an appropriate move without them for example , when president bush was told the twin towers were bombed he could not react immediately he could not feel what was the right thing to do so he waited , waiting for instructions so his left brain could decide what to do it would seem that deep depression is another one of those right brain imprints that never quite make it to upper level left connection and so the malady lives on untouched by conscious awareness repression of feelings set in so early that we come to think that depression is some kind of alien , unknowable force we feel heavy because the deep powerful imprints are being held down , and we cannot seem to lift the burden we are literally carrying a load of pain these imprints are all nonverbal and exceptionally early they are almost unreachable except with a therapy that can get down that deep no intellectual therapy can touch it which is why there is widespread use of tranquilizers in conventional therapy imagine how far the imprint has to travel to reach the higher left brain cortical canopy and make a connection then the therapist says , tell me how you feel all is lost because it is preverbal and nonverbal and cannot be expressed in words a little example from my life someone is writing the story of my life and so he went pretty far to interview one of my shipmates on the battleship we were on together my pal recounted the story of a japanese submarine that came up to the surface and was trying to ram us then we and another destroyer fired on the sub and sank it i have no memory of all this , and i was standing on the gun station next to my pal how is it possible that i do not remember and never did , except small snippets ? i wasn t there i was in my past and my terror without cease where is my past ? i have no idea but i do know that my left side was not properly registering events i may have seen what i saw but the left side did not acknowledge it and so i have no memory and it bothers me no end that my life went by unconsciously i was unconscious of my life and it happens over and over again that friends tell me about high school and i have no memory of it i was so deep in the hold of my early painful imprints that i was never there in the present in my childhood just because the patient is unconscious doesn t mean the doctor has to be the doctor needs to know about the right brain and what it holds when it is ignored any therapy that follows must be misleading the doctor needs to know about how prenatal events get imprinted on the right and what they do to the left above all , the doctor needs herself to be connected one might wonder why i believe the force of the imprint never lessens even when we are sixty years old ? because in the reliving the force is there with all of its power , and the blood pressure , body temperature and heart rate climb to monumental proportions we don t need to study brain damage to understand the contribution of each hemisphere because neurosis and the disengagement from the two hemispheres can explain so much in other words , neurosis is very much like brain damage without there being damage , only dysfunction , which is reversible that is the good part we can be disconnected neuro physiologically through destroyed or damaged tissue , or we can be disconnected through gating without serious damage the result , however , is the same one side doesn t know what is going on in the other side
