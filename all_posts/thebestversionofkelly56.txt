i'm writing this post to share two important messages with you the first is a message we can all learn from the second is for all the mummies of young girls out there my year old daughter annie is a brownie a couple of weeks ago , she brought home a sheet that she had completed with her ideas on how we can help other people smile i adore her thoughts on the subject it 's such a shame so many seem to forget these simple rules of kindness as they get older for those who may struggle to interpret the spelling of an year old i 've had heaps of practice now and thankfully must only ask occasionally , it makes me feel so bad when i need to ! this is what she wrote smile a lot make people happy be kind to them being nice helping people do not be nasty always include people in things make people laugh do n't be rude play with people if someone is being mean to another person stand up for the person being bullied do n't bully people it brought a tear to my eye reading it i'm so proud of her it 's lovely to remember the simplicity of life through a child 's eyes could n't we all learn from her suggestions ? what a different place the world would be if we all followed these rules and appreciated the importance of smiling and kindness is n't it lovely how children do n't discriminate ? they rarely judge or consider stereotypes to them we 're all just people , plain and simple i know the adult world is n't always so straightforward but would n't it be wonderful if it were to see everyone as a person you want to be kind to , a person you want to make smile regardless of anything else as we grow up we see being childish as something negative , to be called childish is usually considered an insult i do n't agree , i'm a huge advocate of being childish occasionally we should all listen to our inner child and we can certainly learn from the children around us looking through the innocent eyes of children can make life so much simpler and sometimes to be a truly good person that 's all you need smiling really does make you feel better and it really is contagious ! ! now for my second message if you have a young daughter it 's never too early to put her name on the waiting list for your local brownie group we moved to a new area when my daughter was thankfully i was advised early on to put her on to the waiting list for brownies thank god , i did ! there are three primary schools in our village yet only one brownie group so places are so hard to get it 's such a shame there are n't more groups as my daughter adores brownies and many girls her age have missed out on the opportunity she 's made friends , learned good lessons , taken part in so many fun activities and even got to spend the whole night at the national space centre ! well that 's it , my two lessons to share with you all today please go out and make someone smile soon ! disclaimer sadly annie 's not always so kind and often forgets these rules , especially when dealing with her little brother ! thank you for reading , i hope this made you smile and taught you some lessons too kelly x if you do n't want to miss future posts please subscribe by email , i'm afraid you 'll have to select web view to do this , i'm working on fixing that suggested posts my breastfeeding story , bullying and all depression and channeling my inner wonder woman why is it so hard to make friends ? part of the joy linky
