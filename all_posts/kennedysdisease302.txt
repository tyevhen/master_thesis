i am often asked where did the name kennedy s disease come from many people , when they first hear kennedy s disease , associate it with some disease that john f kennedy had you can imagine the confusion that exists when kennedy 's disease goes by many names including many are the same and just arranged or spelled differently kennedy 's syndrome kennedy disease spinal bulbar muscular atrophy spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy x linked spinal bulbar muscular atrophy x linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy bulbospinal muscular atrophy sbma and , adding to the confusion , it seems that even researchers and doctors cannot agree on one name for the condition to make matters worse , when some people do a little research on symptoms , they often end up with other neuromuscular disorders or motor neuron diseases including spinal muscular atrophy sma type iv adult onset and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als further , when they hear or read the word disease , people occasionally associate it with something possibly contagious so , why kennedy s disease ? the condition was named after dr william kennedy of the university of minnesota who first identified this disease in the united states i pulled this from dictionary com dr william kennedy kennedy , william robert born american neurologist kennedy enjoyed a long association with the university of minnesota 's medical center in minneapolis , rising to rank of professor of neurology his major area of research was neuromuscular disorders the neuromuscular disorder that bears his name was described in an article published in that he coauthored with m alter and j h sung that being said , it appears dr kennedy was not the first to identify the disorder i pulled this from neurology medlink historical note although kennedy disease bears the name of william r kennedy , the first reports of this disease were likely published by l t kurland , who described an atypical form of lower motor neuron disease in a japanese family kurland following the reports by kurland , magee provided additional descriptions of patients with x linked spinobulbar muscular atrophy in the absence of corticospinal tract involvement magee in , kennedy reported his experience with large families at the mayo clinic in rochester , minnesota kennedy et al the designation kennedy disease was first introduced into the french literature in schoenen et al the disease garnered particular interest as the first example of a polyglutamine repeat disorder , of which there are now several other neurologic examples , including huntington disease and several of the spinocerebellar ataxias whew ! i am glad i did this research because it is all so much clearer to me
