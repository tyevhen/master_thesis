i'm looking for our flag what is the th of july without old glory ? when david and i were in the sixth grade at lincoln elementary school , we sang the patriotic songs , you 're a grand old flag we even memorized the gettyingsburg address , by abe lincoln everyday we said the pledge of allegiance we loved america then and we love it now patriotism ran through our blood we believed the words from the poem on the statue of liberty , give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free , the wretched refuse of your teeming shore send these , the homeless , tempest tost to me , i lift my lamp beside the golden door ! emma lazarus , but , these teeming masses came legally in , and knowing how deeply his father and family wanted to emigrate from holland to america , a great uncle joined the dutch navy at age and labored for four years to earn the money to send his family to america then he returned to the navy and worked four more years until it was finally his turn to go to america he arrived at ellis island only to be told his sight were so bad that he would n't be allowed to enter america discouraged , he returned to holland and re enlisted in the navy and was later lost at sea still , his parents and eight of his siblings enjoyed the freedom and liberty to live in america because of his sacrifice
