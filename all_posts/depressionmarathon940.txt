one to go ! yes , i did it i ran the whole at the whistlestop marathon yesterday it was a good run i followed my plan and walked for one minute at every mile marker however , i strayed from my plan when i realized how easy it was to run fast between the walk breaks , which i also did if i had realized that fact a bit earlier , i may have come close to qualifying for boston as it was , i ran of the miles under minutes per mile , and i finished right at hours not counting the i waited for the porta potty at mile , my running time was closer to i'm pretty happy
