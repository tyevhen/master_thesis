yes , you read that right although many seem to think he 's the next messiah , i do not like obama no , do n't worry , i'm not for mccain mccain is an asshole and palin is a joke but for as to why i dislike obama , i was n't able to articulate it until today to be honest , dislike is n't even the right word really , although that 's the one i'm using unease is probably a better description but anyway , for weeks i 've said i do n't really like him , but when confronted with the why ? i inevitably got when stating my dislike of said presidential candidate , i gave the generic answer that as an anarchist i just do n't believe in politics or politicians , which is true , but is n't really the whole story it 's only tonight , while watching the results , the speeches , and the peoples reaction and discussing all of this with my sister , that i was finally able to truly answer that question why i do n't like obama my sister is excellent at helping me turn my vague feelings and apprehensions into words someone else can understand , so i thank her for helping me to articulate this he 's a walking time bomb , as my sister so aptly put it i'm certainly not the first to wonder wether he 'll soon be the target of some sniper and even if he does live until the end of his term which i certainly hope he does , everything about him , all the sensationalism and hype and enthusiasm surrounding him seems explosive i feel like something big , and most likely not good , will happen , whether it 's by his direct actions or the actions of someone else he 's an excellent speaker , there 's no denying that but the words themselves seem empty , if listened to on their own empty , and also rather cheesy it 's him who makes the words inspirational , and it scares me how people worship him yes , worship the adoration on the faces of the people in the audience , the tears running down their cheeks he 's loved , and trusted , to such an extant that i feel he could give an inspirational speech about what a good idea it would be to walk off of that cliff , and people would gladly obey when i look at his face , i see a mask yes , all politicians act , but with some i feel i get a decent sense of what they 're really like not so with obama all crest smiles and pretty words , he has a perfectly crafted image of the great barrack obama always on display he has it down perfectly he does n't seem to make slip ups but i have the nasty feeling that 's not really the real barrack i saw a very interesting documentary last night on mccain and obama , and the picture it painted of obama seemingly not deliberately on the film makers part , but the picture it painted to me was of a man who loves the spotlight , of someone who gets a rush from having thousands of adoring fans screaming his name i also got a picture of a man who does not follow the will of the people , but instead decides what 's best then convinces the people , with lots of pretty words , that what 's best in his eyes is what they truly want because he makes people truly believe in a system that 's fundamentally corrupt , always has been and always will be , and that caters to the rich , and values production and wealth above all else , including life people need to look beyond the current system to something better , and he 's really not making that an easy thing for people to do i do feel like something momentous may be on the horizon , although not at all in the way that obama talks of change ! i never thought i 'd be around to see the end of our civilization , but lately i 've started to wonder i do feel that this civilization has to end , i do believe it 's destroying our earth and will come down sooner or later regardless of what anyone wants , but that does n't mean i really want it to i want the world that will come after , i want to help build a world that is better , but the fall scares the crap out of me i'm the type of person who walks ot of the room when a movie 's playing if i think a character i like is going to die i really do n't want the loss of life i'm afraid is going to happen when it all comes crashing down and yes , i know that does n't all hinge on obama , but somehow in my mind they 've become closely linked only time can tell whether those connections are imaginary or not so there , my reasons out for all to see if you are an obama supporter , i hope i have n't insulted you , as that really was n't my intention it 's simply my views i 'd love to hear what others have to say about it , your opinions on the matter , what you think of my take on it all so please do comment ! peace please , let there be peace ! idzie you might also like a canadian girl thoughts on the two sides of the border overview of the northeast unschooling conference ! unschoolers winter waterpark gathering an epic adventure linkwithin
