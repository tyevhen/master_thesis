things are going well here my mood continues to be good as i said in my last post , there is freedom in feeling well i am free to make plans , go out , socialize , and most importantly feel rather than the numbness of depression , i can feel enjoyment , hope , gratitude , and any other emotion that comes along freedom my training is coming along , too i was able to run miles , with a few walk breaks , outside on sunday my left knee was a bit sore , but i was able to run with my normal gait pattern , and i recovered well i 've just come home from a great treadmill run this afternoon for the first time i was able to run consecutive miles at a good pace without walking breaks considering it was a treadmill run , which i find incredibly tedious and more difficult than running outdoors , i was quite pleased i'm now feeling more hopeful about returning to my pre surgery running form work is also going well the freedom of feeling good extends to working well i have more energy to pick up more hours , which helps financially , and i'm able to spend more quality time with my patients i feel more creative and find interactions with patients more rewarding than when i'm struggling my brain still fatigues after approximately or hours of work , so i usually keep my shifts to hours or less i'm actually quite fortunate to have control over how many hours i pick up per shift that pretty much covers my life these days it is pleasantly boring once again no drama i like that i'm grateful to be where i'm at today
