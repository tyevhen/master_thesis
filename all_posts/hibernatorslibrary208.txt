bloodchild and other stories , by octavia e butler this is a book of horror dark fantasy stories by the amazing author ocativa e butler believe it or not , this is the first book by butler that i have ever read , and i was amazed at her brilliance her stories were incredibly creative they covered important issues like race , slavery , sexuality , and identity , all in the guise of alien occupation or dystopic disease and other dark fantasy themes her prose was smooth and eloquent the most interesting of the stories was her novella bloodchild , which is about a child that is about to be sexually adopted by some alien worm thing the story encompassed the feelings of the boy , his mother , and the alien providing some very startling insight after each story , butler included a short essay of what she intended the story to mean or background in her life when the story was written these brought further understanding to the story , though i was a little skeptical when she insisted that she had n't intended bloodchild to be about slavery but , i guess , sometimes meanings creep in there unintended and there 's also something to say for the readers' interpretation regardless of intended meaning to me , slavery was one of the many underlying themes of the story at the end of the book , butler included a couple of essays about what it was like being an african american science fiction author , and encouraged young people to follow their dreams and become authors finally , there were a couple of never before published stories this little book is well worth your time if you are interested in deeper cultural issues of race , slavery , and sexuality possibly even if you are not specifically interested in science fiction and fantasy for pure brilliance this post is for r i p x theestellasociety and the halloween reading challenge readingeveryseason it is also for diversiverse , booklust , which is all about reading books by people of a variety of ethnic racial backgrounds , so i will provide tell you a little about the author , octavia e butler octavia e butler was born in into an impoverished african american community to a year old girl despite struggling with dyslexia , she had a passion for reading and writing ever since she was very young as a teenager , she started attempting to publish her stories , despite the extreme difficulty for african americans publishing science fiction fantasy at the time she was one of only a couple african american sci fi writers despite being taken advantage of by money hungry agents , she finally published patternmaster in this book was praised for its powerful prose , and she ended up writing four prequels she finally became mainstream upon publication of kindred in butler died outside of her home in
