it 's august and i'm back in town psychiatrists are notorious for taking vacation in august , i hear they all go to wellfleet sounds wonderful back in baltimore , i'm covering for a vacationing psychiatrist who often covers for me we 've cross covered for years and i 've handled just a few emergency calls , but quite a number of prescription refills they never teach you in medical school or residency the exact right way to handle writing prescriptions for patients of other docs while they 're away , or if they did , i missed that class people do what they 're comfortable with and i have my own standards if you 'll remember from my post covering your some time back , another doc not the one i usually cross cover with once insisted on meeting with one of my patients before he would okay a refill on a medication it was a med she 'd been on for years , and not a controlled substance , so i was surprised that he did n't just authorize the refill over the phone so it 's august , and my phone rang today with a request i'm dr wellfleet 's patient and he 's away and i 'll be out of meds tomorrow why , i think , does the patient wait until the day before they 're out of medicine ? this happens all the time now the confounding factor here is that dr wellfleet prescribes controlled medications more often then i do , specifically stimulants to treat attention deficit disorder , sometimes in high doses , that i do n't generally feel comfortable prescribing these medications , in maryland , can not be refilled or phoned in and the prescription ca n't be faxed the patient must present a hard copy of the script each month to the pharmacist , so the patient 's request the day before creates a number of issues for me first i'm left to decide if i 'll prescribe a controlled substance to a patient i have n't examined , and i have to ask if it 's even reasonable to insist on examining a patient i'm cross covering for particularly on a day 's notice when i likely do n't have an appointment or if i do , what if the patient ca n't meet at the precise time i can ? or what if i meet with the patient and do n't agree with the diagnosis and treatment is it reasonable to take a patient off a medication their regular doc , a well respected and experienced psychiatrist , is prescribing anyway , and if not , then what 's the point of meeting with them anyway ? and what about the time i got a call from a patient out of state requesting a medication i would never feel comfortable prescribing she insisted dr wellfleet 's been prescribing it for years , the pharmacy verified this , the patient was hours away , and if i refused , the patient would go into a withdrawal which would require a hospitalization to manage oy mostly , i deal with cross coverage medication requests by phoning the pharmacy and verifying that the patient has actually been maintained on the medication by the regular shrink , that the medicine really does need to be refilled , that everything is kosher if i can phone it in , i do if it 's a controlled substance , i authorize enough to hold the patient until their regular doc returns if it needs a hard copy prescription , i do my best if the patient calls on a day 's notice , and i'm not scheduled to be in the office that day , they 're out of luck you can skip doses of stimulants without getting sick i suppose i feel a bit like the patient is turning their disorganization into my emergency and when i'm sitting on hold with the pharmacy , negotiating times the patient can pick up the script , or feeling a little uneasy about writing for a specific med , i'm left to wonder if there is n't either a more efficient or more sanctioned way of doing this uncomfortable task without causing people to simply go without their meds , offending the doc i'm covering for , letting the patients risk relapse , or insisting on seeing the patients , with all the muck of what if i do n't agree with the treatment and how will i squeeze them into my schedule so what do other shrinks do ? and blue is the favorite color of half of shrink rap readers
