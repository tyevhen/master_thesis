i have more to say about sleep medications but i have a lot less to say about choosing a sleep medication than i do about choosing an anti depressant , and my thinking on this is a lot less structured everyone who wants medication to help them sleep gets a talk about the obvious sleep hygiene issues here are the basics choose a hour period during which you 'd like to sleep keep it the same everyday , for example , midnight to am , but the exact hours are n't important the regularity is set an alarm do n't nap do n't watch tv or do anything else interesting in bed sleep and sex , that 's it no caffeine after pm and not much before that that includes caffeinated soda and iced tea and sadly , chocolate exercise regularly , preferably hours before you go to bed , but absolutely no closer to bedtime limit alcohol , and do n't drink it near bedtime , it screws up your sleep architecture if you have sleep apnea , use your cpap machine really no one follows these recommendations , at least not when i make them linda , the self proclaimed sleep nazi , would add no screens of any kind after pm for adults and pm for kids no computers , tv , video games even i'm glad i do n't live at her house i prescribe sleep medications frequently , insomnia 's a common complaint sometimes i feel strongly that someone should take a sleep medication disturbed sleep goes hand in hand with affective mood disorders and in patients subject to manic episodes , sleep is really important and i worry that poor sleep habits might either announce or precipitate an episode often , though , i feel like it 's not the end of the world if every night 's sleep is not perfect great blogging gets done in those wee hours , and that some people are too quick to look to pills to fix problems i'm probably going to get blasted for that one sleep issues take on a life of their own people get anxious about not sleeping and it builds on itself they have all sorts of expectations about how much sleep they need or should have one patient was beside herself because she was only sleeping hours a night and felt she needed to hours maybe she was right , but when i suggested that maybe she only needed hours and that 's why she was waking up , she felt i was dismissive and she found another doc another patient said he was greatly relieved when i told him his body was getting rest by just lying there quietly , he stopped worrying so much , and his sleep improved plus , he turned on his cpap machine all medications have the potential for side effects and adverse effects sleep medications are no exception and many sleep medications are addictive and many patients insist they wo n't become addicted and even folks who do n't become addicted in an up the dose , abuse the med kind of way , they get habit forming , whatever that means , and there are people who will end up taking a pill to sleep every night of their lives and wo n't hear of even trying to stop the medicine so my non scientific , mostly random method of picking a sleep medication if the patient presents with depression , i hope that as the depression resolves , the sleep disturbance will resolve some anti depressants are so sedating tcas , remeron , serzone , trazodone that they are effectively sleeping pills other times the anti depressant , especially ssris , cause the sleep disturbance trazodone it works well in combination with ssri 's it 's cheap it 's not addictive it 's easy to stop the down side the fear of priapism and there have been case reports of patients who need surgical intervention ouch the other downside it does n't always work , even in escalating doses or , it works but patients complain of feeling drugged for hours after waking up when it 's good , it 's good if trazodone does n't work or is n't tolerated , and there is no history of substance abuse particularly of issues with alcohol benzos , then i try ambien this usually works , and it does n't have a hangover at least it works for a while , some people get tolerant to it 's effects and some people never want to stop taking it it 's theoretically not very addictive , but it does hit those same benzodiazepine receptors if there 's a history of substance abuse , i may try visteril this works only rarely once someone has had extended exposure to alcohol or benzodiazepines , it 's hard to knock them out if visteril does n't work , i try rozerem , even though i hate the abe lincoln beaver advertising campaign , and even though it costs a small fortune , and even though it did terribly on our survey it does seem to work sometimes i use seroquel or zyprexa these work , though they have that same effect of leaving some people feeling groggy in the a m with all the concern about how these medications are linked with diabetes and lipid disorders , i use low doses , as needed only for the short term , and i do n't prescribe it as quickly as i used to unlike many sleep medications , these are fairly easy to stop if there 's no history of substance abuse , if the patient is a light social drinker with no history of abuse , then i may try ativan or valium for a short term issue restoril works well , though with it 's long half life , it 's always a bit surprising that people do n't feel groggy on this the next day i 've never prescribed sonata , and the first and only patient i gave lunesta to complained of a horrible taste in her mouth with those thoughts , good night , sleep tight , do n't let the bed bugs bite
