i'm still sick in fact , my cold got worse over the weekend my chest is so congested , i'm gurgling ! i 've had pneumonia before , and this does n't feel like a repeat episode , but it 's no fun , nonetheless i'm feeling better today work went well until i talked a lot or laughed either of those things set off a coughing fit but at least i'm not so achy today the combination of illness and full time puppy training have left me totally unmotivated to do much else with the exception of two days , i have not run since returning from mexico and since i did n't run in mexico , it 's been a long , long time since i 've done any training ! i'm feeling a little guilty , a little disgusted , and at the same time , a little apathetic i 've got to get back on the horse soon , or i know my mood is going to suffer my home is already suffering i 'd like it to be cleaned , but i 've not been able to bring myself to do it well , i did pick up a tiny bit yesterday , and i took the vacuum out of the closet , but that 's as far as i got i do feel better in a clean house , so i know i need to get to it soon hmm that sounds familiar eating is another thing i ca n't bring myself to care about oh , i'm eating , but it 's not all that great i have no desire to cook anything ! even the microwave has been impossible lately instead , i 've eaten a lot of toast and cereal i went to a local mexican place last night and again tonight for identical take out orders that 's how uninspired i am i could n't even bring myself to order something different despite this abundance of lethargy , my mood seems to be okay it 's not good it 's not terrible it 's just okay but i'm worried the lethargy and lack of inspiration may indicate the beginning of something more sinister that 's why i need to get back at it i need to do more than go to work and train a puppy , even though doing more seems beyond me at this point in time oh well , at least i know what i need to do
