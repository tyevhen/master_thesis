related post the bank stole my money update kudos to us bank ! after a few more e mails and a couple more phone calls , i spoke with kathleen at the stillwater us bank location where my went missing she confirmed a few pieces of information so she could review the tapes , but then immediately asked for my address so she could send me a check they are going to refund my money she obviously had n't yet reviewed the tapes , but she was going to refund my anyway cool it almost seemed too easy after all the previous hoop jumping perhaps she had already reviewed the receipts and found the teller was at least over i do n't know she did n't say if she found an error or not i do n't really care she did the right thing i am a happy customer who will continue to bank with them maybe that actually did matter for something thanks , kathleen
