from our sidebar poll sex professional fees payment the therapeutic relationship medications votes my vote went towards professional fees , in case you wanted to know when people do n't pay , it 's still stressful , and i still feel awkward about asking to be paid for a lot of people there 's a discomfort about psychotherapy of i have to pay someone to listen to me if i have to ask to be paid well it 's a reminder that i'm here for reasons besides my total devotion to patient care i got bills , too and if i have to ask to be paid repeatedly , well , it can make everything feel pretty uncomfortable okay , sometimes it 's hard to talk about the therapeutic relationship but as the shrink , it 's never hard to talk about sex or meds feel free to chime in
