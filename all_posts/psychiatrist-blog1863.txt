here 's an interesting article from finland in the american journal of psychiatry pubmed looking at potential treatments for intravenous amphetamine or methamphetamine speed or ice dependence since amphetamines are dopamine agonists , the thinking was to replace it with another dopamine agonist such as methylphenidate ritalin or a partial agonist such as aripiprazole abilify , in much the same was heroin is replaced by methadone or buprenorphine while methadone and buprenorphine have proven highly effective substitute medications for opioid depen dence , no pharmacological treatment has been found thus far for amphetamine dependence partial dopa mine agonists such as aripiprazole are considered to be promising medications for addiction , since they are sup posed to balance and restore normal function of the me solimbic dopamine system observational studies , nonrandomized trials , and one randomized study without a placebo arm have suggested that oral dextroamphet amine may be used to replace illicit intravenous amphet amine use , which suggests that oral methylphenidate dopamine reuptake inhibitor might also be used to sub stitute for intravenous amphetamine use on the basis of this information , we aimed to compare the effectiveness of aripiprazole , methylphenidate , and placebo in the treatment of amphetamine dependence using urinalysis as an objective measure of primary outcome what was interesting about this study , and why they stopped it prematurely , was that they discovered that the abilify increased the amphetamine abuse at the end of the double blind , placebo controlled study n , looking only at positive urine samples to indicate relapse , of the placebo group relapsed , compared with of the methylphenidate group mg day , and of the aripiprazole group mg day our results indicate that methylphenidate treatment is associated with a statistically significant reduction in in travenous amphetamine use when compared with pla cebo , providing the first controlled evidence of an effective pharmacological treatment for amphetamine depen dence on the contrary , aripiprazole treatment was associ ated with a higher proportion of amphetamine positive urine samples than placebo while aripiprazole in amphetamine dependence and naltrexone in opioid dependence may be good treat ments in theory , it seems that effective pharmacological maintenance treatments for intravenous drug depen dence are substances that induce at least some euphoria , such as methadone and buprenorphine in opioid depen dence , or methylphenidate in amphetamine depen dence slow release methylphenidate may be superior to usual short acting formulation , since the patient may start experiencing cravings for amphetamine as soon as the ef fect of the substitute drug disappears it is likely that meth ylphenidate should be dispensed mostly on a daily basis under supervision because of its abuse potential ari piprazole mg day was not effective in this trial an ab stinence facilitation trial , but we cannot draw any conclu sions on its potential efficacy in a relapse prevention study among detoxified patients these results show that amphetamine use began to de crease substantially as a function of time after weeks of methylphenidate treatment reaching statistical signifi cance at weeks , which indicates that it may take an even longer period of time than weeks to achieve full benefit from this treatment so , they suggest that , for treatment purposes , ritalin amphetamine methadone heroin , and further suggest daily , administered dosing to reduce abuse , perhaps earning weekend take homes hmm , that does n't sound too promising , except for maybe court ordered folks who want to stay out of jail but the real take home message , for me , is to consider avoiding abilify in pts with psychosis who have a history of comorbid amphetamine abuse amphetamine molecule note the phenyl ring on left , nitrogen on right , and carbons ethyl in middle the squiggly is where a chemical group would be added to change the type of amphetamine compound methylphenidate ritalin molecule note instead of the n amino group on the right , there is now a pyridine ring with the n that makes it less potent norepinephrine molecule note the common phenyl ring on left , n amino group on right , and carbons ethyl in the middle technorati tags speed , amphetamine , methamphetamine , ritalin , methylphenidate , abilify , aripiprazole , addiction , psychiatry , ajp , article blogged with flock
