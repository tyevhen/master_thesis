who would hit her mother and threaten and frighten marie when marie was five , her elderly aunt died marie thought of her aunt as her mother because she was the only caregiver she had ever known none of the family talked to marie about the aunt 's death or how marie felt about this loss since none of the family wanted marie , she went to live with a family friend who already had several older children , and who had little time for marie the older children , who were already in their teens , wanted very little to do with marie , so , she grew up to be a lonely child marie was often bullied in school by children who sensed her emotional vulnerability she had one friend , who was also bullied , and they stuck together until this friend moved away by the time marie was , she had been moved around among several family friends it was obvious to marie that none of them really wanted her , but they did n't want to see her enter into the foster care system her last experience with a physically and emotionally abusive woman was so bad that by the time she graduated high school , marie got a job and moved out on her own when marie came to therapy , she was in her mid s and she had been in a string of abusive romantic relationships she was depressed and she felt hopeless about ever being able to have a healthy relationship over time , marie discovered in therapy that her childhood traumatic experiences had a significant impact on the type of men that she chose to be in a relationship with becoming aware of the impact of her early experiences was a start , but it was
