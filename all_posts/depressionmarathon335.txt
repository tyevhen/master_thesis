my first race since my most recent depression episode is now under my belt saturday morning was gray and cold , much colder than predicted there was also a mile per hour wind , which resulted in really chilly conditions i could n't feel the toes on my left foot until after the three mile mark ! it was a small race , and because of the cold and poor road conditions , we ran two mile loops instead of the mile loop we were supposed to run it was tough , when i arrived back at the starting line half way through the race , tired and cold , to turn around and leave again but i did overall , i am pleased and displeased with the results of the race i started a bit too fast and by mile three was already struggling i am displeased with how difficult the race was for me in the end , i averaged per mile , which is good , but i really struggled to maintain my pace during the race by the time i finished , i was absolutely wasted , chilled to the bone , and very glad to be done despite the difficulty maintaining my form and pace while running , i am pleased with my overall time and pace an pace is good i ran just under an minute pace in my last half marathon , which was last august i was several pounds lighter and in the middle of marathon training last august , so it makes sense i was faster then i expected that i'm happy i approached the pace i ran then unfortunately , i ca n't tell you my overall half marathon time , as the course ended up being about one half mile short my gps read miles at the finish line , and i ran that in doing the math , i figure that would have put me in around if the course had been measured accurately again , that 's only a few minutes slower than the effort last august , so i'm pleased i 'll be happier when i'm a little more comfortable running fast , but for a first effort after my long layoff , i'm fairly satisfied in addition , this race gave me some good information as to my current level of fitness i 've got plenty of room to grow and improve , and that motivates me to keep working hard i'm coming into my two toughest weeks of marathon training , so the motivation could n't have come at a more perfect time
