i finally heard back about my prospective new job the other applicant got it the woman who would have been my boss explained that i was such a strong candidate it was difficult for her not to choose me , but she really needed someone who could work full time the other candidate wanted to work full time i only offered hours per week that was the deciding factor , as i was afraid it would be depression , etta i am really disappointed the good news is they offered me a prn position , which i can add to my other two prn positions , but i really wanted this position the facility at which i applied is one i could picture myself working at for a long time it is a well oiled machine with a positive and respectful environment plus , i have a good friend and former coworker who is an ot there i would love to work with her again oh well hopefully doing prn work for them will keep me foremost on their list of potential hires in the future speaking of the future , i spent the day packing for my trip to boston i leave tomorrow i'm getting antsy for the marathon now i ca n't wait to get there and soak in all the hoopla surrounding the big event i 've had two good , easy but speedy runs this week i 'll run a couple miles on saturday and or sunday before the race on monday i start at am eastern time i'm cautiously looking forward to it thanks , in advance , for any positive vibes sent my way on monday !
