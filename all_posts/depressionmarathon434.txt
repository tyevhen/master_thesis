i ran miles this morning i symbolically donned my bright racing flats in honor of all those who participated in boston yesterday running this morning was my way of waving an angry , stoic middle finger in the bomber 's face it felt good it felt right i was proud to be one of thousands of good people putting foot to pavement today in honor of the victims in boston thoughts of boston , and especially pictures of the victims , continuously streamed through my brain as i ran one victim in particular stuck out his name is jeff bauman , jr , and you 've likely seen his photo more than once he is the young man in the wheelchair , holding his left thigh , accompanied by a man in a cowboy hat both of mr bauman 's legs are missing , traumatically amputated just below his knees it 's a horrific photo , one you 'd expect to see from a war zone , not from the sidelines of a marathon at last count boston surgeons have performed amputations as a result of the bombs' piercing trauma this is what i ca n't stop thinking about mr bauman , and as many as one dozen others , will never again be able to do what i did this morning , easily and efficiently run down the street on two intact legs i ca n't imagine how i would feel waking up to one , or both , of my legs missing what would i do if i was one of those innocent people ? how would i react ? i'm not sure i could handle it my heart aches for these victims i feel so sad for the lost lives and for the friends and families impacted by this senseless act of violence i cannot imagine lives were instantaneously torn apart and will never be the same again as i ran this morning , i took stock of my good fortune i ran with pride i ran with gratitude i was outside easily doing something i love to do in a body which is perfectly suited to do it i'm so lucky i send my prayers to mr bauman and all those injured or affected by this cowardly act i pray that the physical and emotional pain of each victim be relieved i pray that their prosthetics fit perfectly , and that they quickly learn to stand tall within them relearning to walk with prosthetics is not a simple process , but i sincerely hope god smiles down upon them and allows them that freedom as quickly as possible and if running is in the future plans of any of the amputees , i will be honored to share the road with them
