when i was in my early thirties , i did not lack in self confidence in fact , when it came to playing racquetball , tennis , and my work , i was at the top of my game from being a pilot to climbing mountains , there were few limitations i was in control of my life and life was pretty darn good today , if i can open a jar of pickles without my wife 's help , i am ready to do a victory dance around the kitchen that is if i could still dance a great accomplishment these days is to replace a handle on the lawnmower or perform a minor repair on my wheelchair i have said it before , but i believe the mental and emotional aspects of living with kennedy 's disease are as difficult as the physical issues as i lose confidence in my abilities to perform simple physical requirements e g , safely walk from the car to a building or even stand up from a chair , i begin to question everything about my life for years , i tried to compensate for my weakening state , but after many falls and several serious injuries , i realized that some so called 'normal' activities just could not be performed without some assistance for example , in my final few years of working , any stairs , whether three or thirty , were out of the question walking long distances wiped me out those short little 'wheeled' meeting room chairs would force me to stand through a meeting because i knew i could not get up afterwards without help as i became a little smarter , i found myself scoping out all the walkways and looking for alternative entrances and elevators within a building i found a chair with a pneumatic lift and wheeled it into all meetings i paid a terrible price for not being willing to say , i ca n't my life was one little 'white lie' after another until i finally decided to express my limitations and , after i finally did , the world did not end actually , i found everyone was very kind , understanding , and accommodating if only i had been more open and honest about my situation earlier in life , it might have been a lot easier living with kennedy 's disease is a never ending learning process you learn not to take anything for granted losing one 's confidence is not so bad either by questioning your abilities to perform a specific task , it forces you to evaluate the safety of the attempt
