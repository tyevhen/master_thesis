harold mccracken has written a piece about flash 's origins and current condition he lists a number of reasons why flash finally flipped the too annoying bit among them flash got unreliable on some of my computers , mccracken observes , in some some browsers , it works fine but while i was writing this post in google chrome , i got a message saying flash had crashed and the whole browser was rendered unusable flash got cumbersome says mccracken i went through a bout of it constantly telling me i needed to allocate more memory which was a problem in itself even worse the interface it provided for doing so was hopelessly confusing flash got abused especially by misguided web designers who built pointless intro screens that did absolutely nothing for consumers except make it harder to get anything done on the site in question if i were adobe , i d bribe sites if necessary to dump flash intros they ve been enormously damaging to the software s reputation flash didn t evolve fast enough in the right direction for eons , mccracken says , macromedia and adobe have failed to seize the opportunity to make flash as important in the mobile world as it has been on the desktop i agree with many of mccracken 's points but i also think flash 's problems are much easier to sum up than this to my way of thinking , the main problems with flash are simply it 's proprietary adobe could have guaranteed a future for flash by making it open and putting its governance in the hands of a standards body right now , the last thing the web needs is a major graphics format that 's largely closed and under the tight control of one company it relies on plug in technology , which makes it a nuisance , as all plug ins are people do n't want to run plug ins in their browsers , especially resource hungry plug ins that are in frequent need of upgrading it 's arcane flash is an unfamiliar , quirky format with a significant learning curve it 's nonstandard people have enough standard technology to learn without having to go to school on nonstandard proprietary boutique formats if there 's a choice between learning html and learning flash , people are going to wisely choose html at this point , you 're not doing your resume any good by showcasing flash skills on it all in all , adobe has a big problem on its hands and it 's probably too late to do anything about it the tipping point , i think , has been reached flash will ebb mark my words
