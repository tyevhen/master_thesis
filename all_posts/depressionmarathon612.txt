i realized something this morning i put a lot of pressure on myself regarding this blog , i 've been feeling bad about feeling bad i feel like i 've established this positive vibe regarding my blog my story , and i need to keep that up for all of you yet in the past , when i 've felt good , i 've felt bad about feeling too good , afraid that i 'd alienate some of you is n't that something ? i'm damned if i do and damned if i do n't and the damnation is all thanks to my own thoughts ! i'm not sure why i place this pressure on myself it 's one of the unhealthy things i do , i guess perhaps i'm trying to please everyone i know that 's impossible , yet here i am trying to accomplish it i'm going to make an effort to stop worrying about how you will perceive what i write what i write is authentic , but i 'd be lying if i said i did n't smooth out the rough edges that 's silly i feel what i feel it is what it is worrying about whether i'm doing too well or not well enough is not helpful i'm going to have to remove that pressure right now , i'm in a dip a dip is one of the many annoying aspects of this illness it comes and goes my psychologist reminded me , you 've been here before you know it will pass i know it will pass , and it still feels like shit to be in the middle of it ! that 's where i'm at depression sucks it fills me with worry and foreboding my brain feels not my own my thoughts are dark and brooding my energy is low yet i am going to keep moving forward not because i am some kind of hero , but because i am a veteran of depression my experience reminds me , forward is the only direction which may provide relief on this day , i will relax and move forward rather than worry , i just need to do
