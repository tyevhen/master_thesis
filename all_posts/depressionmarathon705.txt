if there is such a thing as delayed onset fatigue , stemming from a completed marathon almost two weeks past , i think i 've got it today has been a tough , tough day i have struggled with fatigue all week , but today i really bonked after sleeping hours overnight , i went back to bed shortly after getting up and slept another two hours somehow i dragged myself out for my tempo run before showering and going back to bed and i slept again when i awoke , around pm , i managed to get in a brief grocery shopping trip i was n't gone minutes before i started to feel like i was about to drop i made it home and drop is exactly what i did it 's four hours later , and i just got up i'm hoping to finish this post before i fall asleep again phew ! i hate feeling this fatigued the f word i'm so glad i had the day off if i 'd had to work today , i would have been in trouble i'm not sure why this fatigue has set in so deeply i feel tired , worn out , flat , and heavy it got so bad today , i could barely tolerate the length of my shower it was exhausting and exasperating ! i was really distressed about it for awhile thankfully , i let go of that distress it was n't doing me any good it only made things worse and i'm feeling a little more hopeful now after all , tomorrow is a new day , and eventually this has to pass right ? god , i hope so
