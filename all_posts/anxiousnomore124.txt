photo by wolfsoul if you have read enough of my posts then you know that my anxiety stems from a deep rooted fear of being judged by others i think it is in part a result from my childhood , because i grew up in a contentious home where we were n't very nice to each other the problem with this fear is that no matter how much i tell myself that people are n't judging me , eventually the time will come when they do and i will hear about it its happened a lot to me lately in one scenario the way i raise my child and my relationship with my husband came into question by a family member at a family gathering my family still has n't learned to be nice to one another i am scared of confrontation and usually avoid it at all costs by trying my best to be a peace keeper , letting hurtful things roll off my back however in this case i lost it and snapped big time i went off on this person and things got awkward really fast needless to say i did n't handle it the best way i could have people talk they talk badly about other people all the time because it makes them feel better about themselves unfortunately i even do it at times but can you imagine how those people would feel if they found out about what was said about them ? today i found out what other people were saying about me and my family , and it cuts deep people that have no clue about my life , my marriage , my family were saying things that were really hurtful it makes me really angry i know that no matter what you do there is always going to be somebody that hates you for something but it still hurts i have to see these people tomorrow morning and spend all day with them and i am getting very anxious just thinking about it its so silly but its as if i'm in high school all over again do adults ever really act like grown ups or is it always a popularity contest ? i wish people were more loving to each other it seems that the worst is always easier to point out than the good no confrontations will be made this time its a special event that i do n't want to ruin by bringing it up but it makes me feel like the spotlight is that much bigger on me i am surprised that the main feeling i have felt has been anger , followed by sadness my heart has really been broken this week and it literally feels very heavy so i am trying to sort through it all now and figure out how to deal and process all the feelings part of me wants to write these people out of my life forever another part of me wants to confront them with the situation as hard as that would be but i know that i am too sensitive and would lose a verbal battle and it would probably make the situation worse part of me just wants to up and move away so that i never have to deal with it running sounds like the easiest thing to do but i know that wo n't happen i feel like everything is just a big ol' mess and i have no idea how to clean it up i know if i let it continue to eat at me then my fear of being judged gets more justification because look at how horrible it is when that happens ! but how do you get over it and just not care ? i have decided to take a look at myself and stop the gossiping that i do of others and try to set an example for those around me hopefully i can stop whatever pain i may be causing anyone else somehow i need to learn to not care what these people think , no matter who they are or what they think any one have any suggestions for me ? i could really use some help right about now you might also like what to do when feeling overwhelmed my story they 're here traveling with anxiety trip linkwithin
