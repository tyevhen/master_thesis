hi friends ! drama central over here we 've been enjoying lots of fall festivities and fun until the weekend of halloween when a nor'easter hit our area and we got a foot of snow the night before trick or treating we 're used to snow , you know ? but the trees had n't yet lost their leaves and the sudden freezing temperatures combined with the heavy snow made many trees fall , explode , lose limbs , etc it knocked power out for a few days for us , and for over a week for many people in this area ! it got so friggin' cold in the house no heat , no real running water , etc etc it was bad luckily , we got our gas fireplace working and we retreated here and there to a friend 's house who had a generator just as i was packing to head to my parents for the rest of the week , our power returned phew ! the night of the storm was scary it was so dark outside no power anywhere and all you could hear was the exploding trees in the woods they sounded like mini bombs going off one tree fell and just missed our house it crashed into our yard and broke several pieces of our fence i thought for sure it was going to hit the roof over our bed , but it missed ! needless to say , i could n't sleep after that when we ventured out the next day to unsuccessfully find a place to eat we could n't go a block without a tree that had fallen or a downed wire there was nowhere to go that was open everyone had no power , no phones , no internet , etc it 's weird how we become so reliant on such comforts it was scary to go without them , even if just for a few days anyhoo , trick or treating was postponed by our town until this past sunday and i'm so grateful paige got to wear her costume and get candy as we 'd been talking about for the whole month ! i'm even more grateful for heat for water for the creature comforts we 've come to rely on and it reminds me how lucky we are to have them so lucky now , to start saving up for a good generator it 's life or death when you do n't have heat in freezing temps sigh that 's new england for ya p s paige wanted to be the big bad wolf for halloween she huffed and puffed , but our house is still standing phew ! save
