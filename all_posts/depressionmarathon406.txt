i'm back on the road preparing for my next marathon , the twin cities marathon , in early october it was nice to run for fun over the past couple of weeks , but there 's something about training that feels right and good i think the structure of training gives my life direction , meaning , and order i actually do n't do well with too much free time , so having a schedule keeps me on track and helps me get things done and as a lifelong athlete , the physical and mental challenges of hitting paces , conquering hills , and logging long miles are all quite gratifying yes , marathon preparation is under way despite thinking , perhaps out loud , that i would never , ever go for a marathon personal record again , which was my thought at mile of grandmas marathon a few weeks ago , i have begun to think about the possibility of course i have ! after all , i was sick at grandmas , and i still ran a personal best ! you all knew this was going to happen , did n't you ? well , i also function better when i have a specific goal i have n't set that goal yet i had a great mile run in the warm rain at am this morning i am going to wait a few more weeks , see how my overall training goes , before i make a decision as to whether i will aim for a fast time at twin cities or not i am excited by the prospect of running well that excitement fuels my desire to follow my schedule and keep training hard it 's nice to be officially back at it
