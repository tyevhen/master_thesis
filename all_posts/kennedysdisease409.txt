neck ? several have asked about my neck weakness it seems to be better , but i have also been more mindful of the time i spend at the computer i also spend an hour or so every afternoon in the recliner with a bog bone pillow for my neck it seems to stretch out the muscles and provide some needed support it is still easy to get caught up with kda stuff and spend too many hours at the computer i just need to be more mindful and the price i pay when that happens contacting old friends last week s article about regrets took an interesting spin yesterday i received a call last night from someone i was friends with in san diego in she said her name and asked if i remembered her i apologized because the name didn t ring a bell then she explained who she was and wow the memories flashed across my mind i was still in the service at the time and we dated for a while we went out to dinner one night she dressed to kill on the way home we heard the grunions were running at one of the local beaches we looked at each other and said , let s go she took off her shoes and peeled off her nylons while i took off my shoes and socks and rolled up my pants we ran up and down the beach that night picking up the fish and throwing them back into the surf while we laughed so hard it hurt she talked about me being such a free spirit at the time and always doing something or going somewhere we talked about our families and our lives and remembered old times i believe this was one of those moments that showed me if she can find an old friend years later i should take the time to find some other friends from my past birthday today i turned again people keep telling me i don t look my age , but i am not certain that is still a compliment
