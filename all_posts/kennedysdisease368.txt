humility a modest or low view of one 's own importance or adjectival form humble is the quality of being modest , reverential , even politely submissive , and never being arrogant , contemptuous , rude or even self abasing i read a good article the other day in the georgia magazine the viewpoint by paul wood , president and ceo of georgia electric is titled , oh , lord , it s hard to be humble and i encourage you to read it he mentions the mac davis lyrics , oh , lord , it s hard to be humble when you re perfect in every way mr wood goes on by saying the two best places to learn humility are on the golf course or at a favorite fishing hole he cited a few examples of what he was referring to you can be five strokes ahead in a golf tournament when that little round ball decides to take a bath in the nearest pond , play in the sand in a bunker , or hide behind a tree in the rough you can be president of the united states and it still won t matter to a striped bass or trout president hoover once said , all men are equal before fish fish make no distinction between presidents and garbage collectors paul wood goes on to call these situations teachable moments humility is a tough row to hoe because it is natural for us to want to be recognized , admired and appreciated for the things we do he also mentioned that ben franklin was quoted , even if i could completely overcome pride , i would probably be proud of my humility the article concludes by mr wood commenting on his relationship with golf he said it if you want to know if a person is arrogant or humble invite him to play a round of golf with you watch his reaction when he makes a bogey and when he makes a birdie does he ignore his success and talk about how he could improve his game or does he brag incessantly throughout the round ? golf will reveal his true character and guarantee his humility being both a fisherman and golfer at one time in my life , i would agree i could also add a few other sports because of several humbling personal experiences yet , there has been nothing more humbling in my life than the progression of a non treatable disease the progression attacks you physically , mentally and emotionally the impact on you physically is the most evident area in the beginning there are only minor changes in your capabilities you can always find some excuse that explains your inability to accomplish something over time , however , there are no more excuses and acceptance steps in the progression attacks you mentally also most of us have played some competitive sport where you played with an injury you gutted it out mind over matter as you progress , however , you no longer can gut it out when the muscles stop working , it doesn t matter how strong your mind determination is finally , when it comes to emotions , the progression eats away at you almost everyday initially , it shows itself as fear my god , what is happening to me ? later , it shows up as doubt what are we going to do if this gets any worse ? and how long can i continue to work ? even later , resignation sneaks in oh crap , i never thought it would be this bad ? and , will this never end ? where i was once self sufficient and confident , i often find myself in need of something or someone to just get through the day now that is humbling ! acceptance is what i am working on today for without it , i will never be able to take the next step forward
