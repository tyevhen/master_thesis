journal entry number three please do n't read if you feel this may be triggering wednesday nd october as far as we 're aware , we only get one life supposedly this means i should do whatever i can put my mind to , but it 's never that easy aside from the cliche , the thought of having so much life and killing it makes me sad in this world we all have choices which can change our destiny choices which shape the gift of life because that 's what life is , a gift , which can be taken away just like the popping of a balloon it 's fragile and too often i feel people can forget , myself included when i'm at the depths of my illness but death may be just around the corner and yet people still decide to take damaging risks with their life what we must understand is that although life can be the darkest hell we have ever seen , it can also be the most beautiful thing ever to experience i just wish i could show people what life can be and although we never know what 's around the corner , i hope i'm not going to look back one day and see sadness in my eyes i wrote this when i was sitting on a bus i believe i was observing all of the different people we drove past and ended up writing this passage i'm not sure that i was the most depressed i had ever been at that point , but i remember that i was n't the happiest it must have been a time when i felt hope but also sadness a time where i was thinking about my future and what i wanted to make from it i suppose , a realisation that a future from a time of hell was possible something that is also possible for you best wishes , amy xx
