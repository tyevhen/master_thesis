hello everyone it 's saturday and i decided to give myself the day off i thought i 'd check in on this blog and the associated email account i was surprised and touched by all of your comments and emails i know i 've said that before and it might seem trite but it 's true i feel deeply grateful for your interest in me and this blog i'm okay for now nothing focuses the mind like a deadline i 've been and will continue to be frantically working on this damn book for a few more weeks it 's about all i think of these days which , in its way , is a blessed distraction from my own internal morbidity it 's also why i have n't posted much lately up or down , more writing is not really something i want to do after a long day 's work many of you have expressed genuine anxiety over my state thank you i really am okay and , upon entering my three favorite months september , october , november i should be so for a while now i know i do n't post with any sort of regularity i'm sorry about that but i find that navel gazing is n't always the best option for me but , in creating this blog and allowing you to become invested in it , i do have a certain obligation to you so , let 's make a date on october , when the trees are at their autumnal finest in my region , let 's meet outside at am on that day and at that time , i will be outside , enjoying nature and feeling alive i hope you will join me nevermind time zones , etc this is about the act , not temporal concurrence
