good morning i'm sending you to look at two articles today , both by or about people who have been on our blog before over in the new york times , robin weiss has a fabulous article about her work with a patient who wanted to know details of her personal life , the 'rules' of psychotherapy dr weiss talks about how revealing such information goes against the 'rules' of psychotherapy , and she discusses reasons why she decided that in this case , it made sense to break the rules she writes as therapy continued with her , i heard how flat and tinny i sounded whenever i attempted to analyze what was going on between us when i lapsed into too clinical a mode , our connection would wobble , and her alienation became palpable in contrast , as i began , in the face of her challenges , to let down my guard , our alliance grew stronger , and she became open to treatment we would laugh together about her bringing me just the right greeting card or a flower from her garden exhibiting her need to challenge the rules and exposing my need to interpret her actions these interactions helped develop her capacity to observe herself in action , as she courted me in her sherpa style i may have been a slow student , but eventually i understood i was the one who had to change from then on , when she saw that look in my eyes , i said yes , i did have a migraine we followed episodes of the tv show er together , and i told her where i was going when i left for vacation i like the flexibility this articles conveys all patients are n't alike , they and their psyches do n't all follow , or even know , the rules it 's good to question things when the treatment does n't seem to be working and in the new yorker , jeff swanson , a medical sociologist at duke , is interviewed for an article by maria konnikova for is there a link between mental health and gun violence ? dr swanson has a wonderful idea instead of preventing people from owning guns because they have a psychiatric diagnosis , we should prevent people from owning guns because they are violent konnikova writes in all of his work , swanson has found one recurring factor past violence remains the single biggest predictor of future violence any history of violent behavior is a much stronger predictor of future violence than mental health diagnosis , he told me if swanson had his way , gun prohibitions wouldn t be based on mental health , but on records of violent behavior not just felonies , but also including minor disputes there are lots of people out there carrying guns around who have high levels of trait anger the type who smash and break things , he said i believe they shouldn t have guns that s what s behind the idea of restricting firearms with people with misdemeanor violent crime convictions or temporary domestic violence restraining orders , or even multiple d u i s
