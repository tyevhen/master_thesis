mega is a popular freeware program for creating phylogenetic trees and sequence alignments , analyzing gene sequence data , performing various calculations such as tajima 's d , computing pairwise distances between sequences , and doing lots of other types of genetic analysis this program is widely used and is based partly on the work of masatoshi nei , the famed penn state molecular geneticist and author of the seminal book mutation driven evolution which i highly recommend you need this program if you 're into molecular genetics in my last post , i showed a phylogenetic tree that i created in mega for thymidine kinases of phages and hosts you can make trees of this sort yourself in a matter of minutes using mega let me take you through a quick example here 's how to recreate the tree involving thymidine kinase further below , i 've listed the fasta sequences you 'll need obviously , you can obtain your own sequences from uniprot org or other sources , if you want to make your own phylo trees based on other sequences all you have to do is copy and paste fasta sequences into the alignment explorer window of mega , then generate a maximum likelihood tree or a parsimony tree , or whatever kind of tree your prefer here 's the exact procedure fire up mega click the align button in the main taskbar see screenshot below choose edit build alignment from the menu that pops up a new window will open note a dialog may ask you if you are creating a new data set answer yes a dialog may also appear asking whether the alignment you 're creating will involve dna , or proteins if you 're using the amino acid sequences shown further below , click proteins in mega , click the align button on the left side of the taskbar select edit build alignment paste fasta sequences into the alignment explorer window select all control a choose align by clustalw from the alignment menu an alignment options dialog will appear accept all defaults by clicking ok after the alignment operation finishes it takes seconds , go to the menu and choose data export alignment mega format save the meg file to disk now go back to the main mega window and click the phylogeny button in the taskbar a menu will drop down select the first item construct test maximum likelihood tree a dialog will appear asking if you want to use the currently active data set click no this will bring up a file navigation dialog use that dialog to find the meg file you created in step select that file and click open a tree options dialog will appear if you just want to see a tree quickly , accept the defaults and click ok the tree will take less than seconds to generate if you want to do a test of phylogeny this part is n't obvious ! , click the item to the right of test of phylogeny see the graphic below and choose bootstrap method , then set the number of bootstraps using the dropdown menu see screenshot below click the compute button to build the tree if you want to do bootstrap validation of tree nodes , you have to click the yellow area to the right of test of phylogeny see red arrow above choose bootstrap method then set number of bootstraps to note that if you choose to do a bootstrap test of phylogeny , the tree may take minutes or more possibly much more to build , depending on how many nodes it contains bootstrapping is a compute intensive operation the idea behind bootstrap testing is that node assignments in phylo trees are often uncertain , and one way to check the robustness of a given assignment is to systematically introduce noise into the data to see how readily a node can be made to jump branches a node that can easily be tricked into jumping to a different spot in the tree is untrustworthy the bootstrap test attempts to quantify the degree of reliability of the node assignments usually , you want to do at least several hundred tests is considered adequate if a given node jumps branches in half the tests , the tree will carry meaning confidence at the top of the branch , meaning there 's a only certainty that that particular node assignment is correct as to branch location a tree where all the branches have numbers greater than can usually be considered reliable mega will output maximum likelihood trees , parsimony trees , and other types of trees , and the program will do an amazing variety of calculations and statistical tests most times , you can save analyses in excel format , which of course is a godsend in case you need to do additional analysis that ca n't be done in mega the documentation contains many helpful tutorials be sure to give it a look if i had a wish list for mega , it would be quite short mainly i 'd like to be able to see quick graphic summaries of things like the ratio of synonymous to non synonymous mutations in two dna sequences the data for this is available via the hyphy command under the selection taskbar button , but only as raw spreadsheet data you have to sum the columns yourself in excel to get certain kinds of summaries , and if you want a graph , you have to create it yourself this is hardly a major drawback still , it would be nice to see more summary data , quickly , in graphical form when you align two or more genes in the alignment editor , it shows asterisks above the identical nucleotides , but does n't show percent identity anywhere , nor percent positives for amino acid data the alignment editor also does n't respond properly worse it responds inappropriately to mouse wheel actions , jumping to the end of a file horizontally when you wanted to wheel scroll vertically also mildly annoying the tree renderings are bitmaps i would much prefer to see svg scalable vector graphics format , which in addition to being infinite resolution vector format also allows easy editing of line widths , colors , fonts , labels , etc in a simple text editor as it is now , to edit line widths or colors in phylo trees , you have to drag out photoshop but overall , i have few significant complaints and much praise for mega it 's an immensely powerful program , it 's fast , it 's quite intuitive , and the best part is , it 's free for a more detailed commentary on the program 's design philosophy and capabilities , see this excellent paper by tamura , nei , et al it was written at the time of mega , but applies equally to mega below are the fasta sequences used in making the phylo tree for yesterday 's post you can cut and paste these sequences directly into mega 's alignment explorer sp p kith bpt enterobacteria phage t
