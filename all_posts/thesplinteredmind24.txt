the monthly mind is something i ve been wanting to do for some time , but always procrastinated now with my book coming out , i want to have a monthly newsletter for people who discovered me through my book who don t do twitter , facebook , or blogs you can subscribe with the form below i don t sell addresses , and i won t spam you this will be an extra blog post , if you will , that i ll send out each month with tips and suggestions for dealing with adhd , depression , suicide , and anxiety hopefully , i ll be able to keep my cheekiness intact don t want to go and take myself too seriously now , do i ? unfortunately , the service i use now does include ads in the mailing it s not optimal , i admit in fact , i wasn t aware there were ads , so my apologies for those who have been receiving the blog updates through feedblitz since i ll be either paying feedblitz to remove the ads , or i ll be using a new service regurgitating my rss feed is not actually what i want to be doing for the monthly mind , so i m thinking a new service is on my near horizon i ll transfer your address there when that happens , so no worries about having extra work around the corner signing up for the newsletter is easy just submit your email address below and you ll receive a verification email with more information via feedblitz this page s content will change as the newsletter becomes more finalized you might also like when today is tomorrow and other adhd blunders suicide no one cares ? it depends on who you listen to are you cool enough for the suicide club ? the problem with drive by suicide notes linkwithin
