it 's come to that time of year again where i look at the past year i ca n't believe that i have been doing this for three years now ! where to start although i expected this year to be one of little change , it turns out that there have been some things that have happened which have been unexpected , i suppose ! one of my biggest achievements of this year was getting my first car and driving by myself this is something that i was petrified of in the beginning , but as soon as i got used to it , it become second nature to me this was even more so the case when i got my first paid job if you have been reading for a long time , you 'll know that getting a paid job was at the top of my anxiety hierarchy and after doing volunteering for two summers , i finally got the courage to go for a paid job this was extremely hard for me i spent many days crying both before and after getting the job , panic attacks whilst at work and swearing i would never go back because the anxiety it gave me was just too much nevertheless , this paid job allowed me to earn my own money and with that came a sense of achievement , it allowed me to drive my car alone a lot more and definitely increased my confidence it also happened that this year , i handed in my resignation for this paid job too because with third year degree studies and working so many hours in a week , it just was n't good for my mental health , so i took that challenging step too even though i only worked there for three to four months , i do n't regret undertaking it in the ice bar of amsterdam ! during this year , i also went on holiday with my friends to amsterdam now , that was one of the best trips i have been on i definitely recommend amsterdam and i will hopefully be going back i also went on my first holiday with my partner this makes two holidays where i 've had to rely on my own instinct to get home in one piece i will hopefully be travelling a lot more as many of you know , i am now into my third and final year of my law degree i have managed to survive it this far , so i'm just hoping that i will graduate next year further to this , i also became the president of my university 's mental health society in which we set up events for people to come along to and raise awareness i also try to improve the welfare side of things at university by working with students and staff as a member of the welfare committee it 's a very busy final year and can also be very anxiety provoking ! renting my own flat with my partner is something that i have never done before until now in theory , it will be my first flat where i will no longer be a student and out in the big wide world of work this will be the first time we will be living together outside of shared accommodation , so a new challenge will be underway ! a final challenge i can think of is part of my weight loss journey since january of this year , i had been determined to lose the weight that had been put on , partially because of medication to this date , i have lost just over three stone it has been extremely hard and for me , it 's been about counting calories and going to the gym nothing more and nothing less i have had times of crying , i have given up , but most of all i have still made it i have little bit more to go , but if you put your mind to it , you can achieve anything this is the same with your mental health sometimes , mental illness can require a lot of willpower to overcome your fears sometimes , you wo n't be able to , like i have felt many times before , but sometimes you will find that spark that allows you to take that bit of courage and run a mile through your fears i promise , that with will power comes hardship , but it 's worth it and every single one you is capable overall , this year has been full of many achievements but there have been also some times of severe depression , suicidal thoughts and self harm and feeling utterly lost and out of control , especially during the summer months these elements are still present in my life and are things i still tackle on a daily basis , however i feel i have improved year on year and it just goes to show , even if you have faced times of extreme lows , you can still go ahead and achieve things we are not alone in this battle , and i know you have the strength to battle this illness it 's not easy , but it 's definitely worth it i 'd love to hear what your year has been like let me know in the comments below merry christmas ! amy xx
