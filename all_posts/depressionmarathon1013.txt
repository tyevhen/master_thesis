to add insult to injury , my softball team got whipped last night , it was cold and raining a perfect ending to a miserable week oh , wait , it 's only mid week it 's not over yet ! damn it 's been that kind of week i wish it was over i wish it had never begun it 's thursday , and i 've yet to run one mile , bike one mile , perform one minute of yoga , or do anything other than sleep and eat ! i hoped softball would be the key to unlock my gate , but i'm still fenced in stuck , i am , behind heavily barred walls with the ceiling falling in my space is shrinking i'm suffocating in the absent air worry panic setting in it 's been that kind of week is it over yet ? when will it end ?
