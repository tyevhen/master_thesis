despair is giving in absolutely to catatonia , immobility , infantilism , hopelessness , bowing down to the darkness , agreeing with the devil in depression you experience the temptation to all these things but persevere in the face of them , acting as if , pretending to hope , believing one day you will be better my weeping spells generally occur around am or pm or both today i was hit early , in the shower , around am what triggered it ? i was remembering my last hospitalization in january of , when it took all the strength i had to get out of bed and get into the shower i mean all my strength every last jot and tittle of my conscious will afterwards i tried to tie my shoes i could n't remember how to tie my shoes it was as if i had to re think every step of the process , to learn all over again as if i had never done it before it was extremely puzzling but i finally mastered it likewise as i was showering today i was forgetting how to shower in what order did i apply shampoo ? had i shampooed already ? when to scrub my back ? i burst into tears because i was reminded of trying to tie my shoes in ' when severely depressed you ca n't take any automatic behavior for granted , and it 's a terrible thing to have to start every task from point zero , to have to look up your own phone number , to try to remember anything you 've read depression is much harder on the memory than ect how i wish i had insurance and could afford ect ! so on with the drug trials you see , my present antidepressant is cymbalta , which has a short half life , which means the blood levels rise and fall quickly , much more quickly than prozac , for instance therefore missing a day or taking a half dose for two days can completely undermine any progress thus i wonder if part of this roller coaster is because mornings my blood level is lower , and perhaps i have another drop in the late afternoon then this is my usual pattern in depression of sadness seizures , so who knows ? i think it may be time to change my antidepressant this one has me sputtering it drops me like an eagle drops a fish back in a lake , where i wait for another eagle tears on my keyboard finished , words of novel revision my how it sucks ! of course i think all my work sucks in this condition i 've been going through my unpublished poems and deleting liberally , poems that failed , poems i never want to see again i do feel better after i cry numb , perhaps , but the tension is somewhat relieved in my grief my infant self cries out for daddy mommy god pitiful , huh ? but human , so human i do n't know god he may know me let him worry about me i'm too sick to worry about him kilorats , ce
