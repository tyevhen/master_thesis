depression sucks the energy out of us causing us to feel sad , fatigued , lethargic , anxious and many other negative feelings fortunately there are many sources of energy we can draw from to help overcome depression we have control over the energy we feed ourselves thus controlling our depression one such source of energy is color scientists have proven that color can calm the mind , stimulate activity and help us deal with depression science has also proven that throughout our body we have main energy channels that are connected to our organs each energy center is referred to as a chakra chakra is a sanskrit word meaning wheel basically each chakra is a spinning wheel that sucks in what we give it and transfers it to our glands which produce and secrete hormones that boost mood and the rest of our body each of our seven chakras draw in coded information from our environment coded information such has color vibrations , ultra violet rays , or another person s aura when all seven chakra 's , channels of energy controlling our entire body , are flowing smoothly , we feel great physically , spiritually and emotionally but when one , two or three of our chakra 's are disturbed or filled with negative energy , we feel weak , out of sink and depressed the sun is the ultimate energy source it sustains all of life and the earth without it , we would not exist using the sun or certain kinds of light is actually a very effective treatment for depression that we will discuss in later posts and pages but for the sake of chakras , understand that the sun has very powerful visible light rays that can be turned into colorful light if you place a prism in front of the sun , we get the seven colors light rays that make up the chakras and since we know that light and color are effective treatments for depression and chakras are energy channels in our body that feed off the energy derived from color , light and other sources , we can effectively use color to help treat depression the goal is to feed all seven chakras with positive energy thus helping us cope with depression since each channel is connected to specific glands that produces and secrete certain hormones , we know which chakras to treat for depression and what colors to focus on to help us deal with depression if you look at the depiction and corresponding chart below , you see that it is important to focus on all seven channels in order to effectively cope with depression specifically , the st , nd and th channels , redphysical needs , orange emotions and violet understanding , are especially important to feed positive energy as you learn how to deal with depression and eventually rid it form your life the red channel is connected to the adrenal gland which is responsible for producing adrenaline as you know , people who are depressed lack adrenaline , motivation if we can find ways to tap into the red channel and thus the adrenal gland , you can learn to create the adrenaline necessary to produce the motivation needed to combat depression the orange channel is connected to the gonad gland which is responsible in part for helping produce the hormones that regulate emotion and energy testosterone and estrogen etc a depressed person naturally is in the low spectrum of mood and has a difficult time climbing out of depression by feeding the orange channel positive energy , one can learn to produce the hormones necessary for us to climb out of the depressed mood spectrum and into the high end , happy mood spectrum the violet channel is connected to the pineal gland which produces the serotonin derivative melatonin melatonin is the hormone that makes us feel sleepy and regulates our sleep patterns depressed people often feel sleepy during normal wake times , thus unmotivated to act and crawl out of depression essentially they are producing too much melatonin , they are feeding the violet channel chakra too much negative energy , thus producing too much melatonin melatonin is used to treat seasonal mood disorders such as depression by feeding the violet channel positive energy one will theoretically decrease the production of melatonin , feel more
