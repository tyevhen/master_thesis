before i get too carried away the answer to the question is most likely yes it is a benign supplement that is based on all of the studies and reviews i have about melatonin used to treat insomnia and other sleep disorders nobody seems to report any major side effect from even very high doses taken for periods of time those same reviews have a lot of qualifiers as an example some will say that doses in the mg per night range are unlikely to cause major side effects others will suggest that even though melatonin use is widespread , there have not been any large clinical trials to assess long term safety there probably never will be when people ask me about the safety of melatonin that is exactly what i tell them individual use of over the counter melatonin varies greatly the average self administered dose that i encounter these days is milligrams the range of outliers is to the high side nobody uses the mg or mg tablets but there are people using mg my concerns come from a number of perspectives first there is the issue of normal excretion of melatonin and pharmacokinetics second there is the role of melatonin in other systems in the body and third there is the question of the toxicology of melatonin in the case of supplements , the presumed toxicology is often based on the exposure of large numbers of people to the supplement and no alarming or immediate side effects melatonin is ubiquitous in some tissues in the body and this gives the impression that it may be a benign compound on the other hand it is a metabolite of ht serotonin and this has additional implications ht is a highly politicised molecule with unquestionable roles in human physiology and pharmacology when i start to think about the general approach to this problem the first thing i look at is what the physiological levels of melatonin might be in both blood and csf the published medical literature in this area seem scant normal levels are often determined as part of an experimental intervention like peripheral sympathectomy in one study , the normal diurnal fluctuations were noted with a peak ranges of peak plasma levels varied from pmol l , and the peak csf levels from pmol l in this study the authors demonstrated that bilateral t t ganglionectomy abolished both the diurnal rhythms and resulted in lower levels of melatonin suggesting that the peripheral sympathetic nervous system has input into melatonin secretion other studies have looked at the effects of melatonin supplementation on plasma and csf levels this is always important because average natural melatonin secretion in humans is about mg per day as i previously indicated supplementation is many times that an early study showed that oral melatonin supplementation led to rapid increases in blood and csf melatonin the authors also compared the ratio of cfs blood melatonin and noted it was constant before and after supplementation suggesting that blood is the source of csf melatonin recent studies suggest that melatonin is secreted directly into the third ventricle from the pineal recess or that there may be central or peripheral compartments of melatonin for different effects there was a recent comprehensive review of the pharmacokinetics of melatonin the authors reviewed high quality studies looking at oral or iv dose ranges of mg to mg cmax maximum plasma concentration following the dose ranged from ml h mg , iv to , pg ml mg , oral tmax time to peak plasma concentration ranged between mg and min mg t half life ranged from mg , iv to min mg , oral the response to melatonin for insomnia is unpredictable and no dose response curve has been determined of course there are a wide range of available melatonin preparations from pharmacies and health food stores even in the research , it is often difficult to say what preparation was used , but the bioavailability is quoted as the sleep research on melatonin shows that as most clinician know it has weak sleep effects but variability does exist most people will notice very little effect some will claim that they were knocked out and strongly sedated even the next day an effect that is hard to reconcile with the short half life the lack of a dose response curve makes it difficult to determine dosing but a review in an authoritative sleep text says that most studies use a dose of mg and that the timing of the dose hours before sleep may be an important factor i have been advised myself by a sleep expert that a mg dose of melatonin hours before sleep may be optimal because it entrains the circadian rhythm of that individual and have seen that work in many cases the weak effects on sleep eeg to me suggest a strong placebo component getting back to the side effect issue i was surprised to find a few pages on melatonin in last week 's new england journal of medicine in their clinical implications of basic science research section these authors discuss the implications of the mtnrb variant as a risk factor for type diabetes mellitus this variant leads to an overexpression of mt melatonin receptors on pancreatic beta cells melatonin in this case leads to a g protein coupled receptor gpcr initiated cascade that inhibits insulin secretion they reviewed the epidemiology of diabetes and the facts that type diabetes is typically a combination of insulin resistance in muscle and fat cells , increased hepatic glucose output and no compensatory insulin release they reference an experiment where the daily melatonin mg dose for months reduced first phase glucose induced insulin secretion in an oral glucose tolerance test compared with baseline before melatonin secretion they point out that there has been some epidemiological work that associates shift work with susceptibility to diabetes mellitus they conclude that typical doses of melatonin of mg day or less are not likely to be associated with decreased insulin release and talk about the application of melatonin in jet lag with dosing for a few days they also point out in the month long study that overall glucose tolerance was hardly affected and baseline glucose levels returned after hours of dosing that may not be as assuring to psychiatrists who are seeing their patients take mg indefinitely along with other medications that may cause metabolic syndrome to me this is also further evidence of just how crude many of our clinical trials are that look at the issue of metabolic syndrome and diabetes in clinical populations whenever i discuss consent for atypical antipsychotics and the metabolic issues , i always tell people that weight gain and increased appetite is common i also tell them that i have seen people develop diabetes from these medications who were rail thin and never gained an ounce the risk alleles for type diabetes mellitus , the thousands of associated intracellular signalling proteins , and the gpcrs expressed in pancreatic beta cells probably has something to do with that biological complexity rarely leads to simple answers i will probably encourage a lot of insomniacs from taking melatonin when there has been no clear benefit i will probably also discourage the practice of taking high dose mg of melatonin for the same reason george dawson , md , dfapa references bruce j , tamarkin l , riedel c , markey s , oldfield e sequential cerebrospinal fluid and plasma sampling in
