dear a b dr laura 's marriage books seem to prescribe food , sex no nagging for pleasing husbands this rings true for me i 've been under the weather for several weeks the meals have n't been up to snuff last night in particular , i really gave up just put a bowl of pasta in front of my husband for dinner with some sauce on it this is hardly something i do routinely or plan to make a habit of i went to the doc yesterday , got antibiotics for a sinus infection , hope to be feeling lots better in a matter of days i hope to be getting my groove back soon ! my husband who has a history of throwing really bad tantrums , as you may recall really flew into a rage i followed your advice , detatched , moved into another room did n't respond as he continued for minutes to rant about my flaws at high volume from down the hall he slept downstairs left for work this a m i'm no spotless lamb yes , my meals have n't been so good lately , but as i said , i was n't planning to cook this way forever what made it worse in his eyes was that i bought an antique mirror for the entry hall day before yesterday not expensive a gravy boat saucer yesterday at a junk shop it was sitting on the kitchen table with hyacinths from our yard in it these were attempts to give myself a lift when i was n't feeling well my husband was livid though , because he felt the energy that i put into shopping i could have put into meal prep he has valid points i believe , but instead of stating them , he throws a fit gets mean i want to please my husband work hard at doing so regularly i hope to be on top of my game again want to cook better , but i do n't appreciate being bullied i 've been bullied for yrs , have made it too clear that his happiness is my main objective he knows this , so he seems to use that against me in his rages what to do now ? what would you say to him if anything if you were me ? thank you g o dear g o your husband 's aggression is physical and very visible your aggression is hidden passive aggression both are immature and unhelpful you cannot change your husband you can only change yourself if you are less aggressive and mean , then he wo n't attack you so much if his attacks are too physical , you must call or leave it is hard to catch your own meanness when we are tired and feeling down , we get mean everybody does unless they make themselves aware of their own meanness so they catch themselves and do n't do it you see his meanness and tantrums as attack he sees them as defense if you are less mean and aggressive your life will improve because when of any population is more peaceful it can make a big change you blame your lack of interest in providing meals on the fact that you 've been under the weather suppose your husband did n't bother to go to work for several weeks and do his job because he felt under the weather is n't getting good meals your job ? you give yourself a lift by shopping and spending and do n't do anything to give your husband a lift by getting him a nice dinner your behavior was no less mean as my sister in law used to say boys punch , girls pinch it is so easy to be mean and it 's difficult , it goes against the grain , when you yourself are down and just want to be pampered , to reach out to your nearest and dearest in a giving way and try to give them a lift a b curtiss dear a b while i do n't see my behavior as mean , i am willing to hear what you have to say since i respect you so much i want to explore it i guess what i thought i was doing was trying to be in a better mood , so i would feel better , yes , but also in turn be better company i know how smart you are , want to carefully consider my actions in a different light what would you do , specifically , tonight ? i do n't want to exacerbate things thanks , g o dear g o fix a nice dinner and apologize for your bad cooking because you were n't feeling so hot the last few weeks a b curtiss
