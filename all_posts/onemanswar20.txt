by jack smith william styron called the term depression a wimp of a word for such a major illness in darkness visible , styron says the word has slithered innocuously through the language like a slug , leaving little trace of its intrinsic malevolence and preventing , by its very insipidity , a general awareness of the horrible intensity of the disease when out of control put another way , depression is a hell of a lot worse than the word implies many have felt depressed at one time or another , usually from a negative event in life chronic clinical depression called major depressive disorder is another matter , and a surprising number of people suffer from it most things i read suggest in battle depression think about what that means in a town of , , some , people are suffering from depression it breaks my heart to think of those who suffer in silence as i did for too long i am one of a fortunate few , though i am currently seeking treatment at a place called the menninger clinic in houston it is one of the best places in the world for complicated mental illness cases my case is a bit complicated because i ve had several different diagnoses and i ve abused alcohol most of my life since high school shortly after my recent overdose , one doctor confidently declared that i ve needlessly suffered for years because i ve been misdiagnosed all this time he diagnosed me with bipolar ii disorder and the depression that goes with it and put me on lithium the frustrating part came a week later when a second doctor declared with equal confidence and assurance that i was most certainly not bipolar he said i suffer from major depressive disorder and anxiety issues that make it worse already depressed and anxious for answers , i was now confused and frustrated that s what led me to menninger part of the process here at menninger is spending many hours a week with my treatment team we ve spent a lot of time talking about my tortured history this exhausting process has given me a chance to read through my journals spread out over a decade while flipping through it , i found a description of what depression feels like i hope sharing it helps others who suffer know they are not alone it is hard to explain how much depression hurts i feel like i have descended into hell i am mired in a pit of utter despair and hopelessness , and my body aches my mental illness tortures my mind but it causes physical pain , too my back aches , my stomach churns with anxiety and my head and face feel lifeless and heavy my disease lies to me i don t want to believe the lies , but my depression is cunning and ruthless it waits until my body and spirit are weak because it is one cruel bastard it tells me i can t get out of the bed , shouldn t bother going to work today and i may as well just shut the door and pull the covers over my head it tells me there is no hope depression is misery that s what one of my worst days felt like , but i don t feel that way today i awoke early , feeling rested , read from romans and shed a happy tear after reading a stirring , quite remarkable letter of hope from my daughter she and her brothers and their mom are my inspiration today i miss home but know this is where i need to be right now god has put me here and i can feel his loving arms holding me up his arms and the prayers , love and support of many who have reached out since i began sharing publicly for the first time the nature of my illness thank you , family thank you , friends and thank you , strangers who may not know me but do know my story all too well regular access to my blog is not allowed , nor is access to facebook , but i have conned the staff into letting me write this entry maybe i can share some more as my journey here progresses if not , i will share more when i return home grace and peace
