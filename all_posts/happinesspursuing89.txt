i really haven t tried too many herbal remedies for depression st john s wort seems to be a popular one i might even have heard once that it s recognized in germany as a proper drug and covered under whatever sort of health insurance system that they have i tried it once a couple of years ago back when i was still toiling away in the corporate world and found that all it seems to do was put me on edge no , that s not right because it sounds like i had coffee like jitters it made my emotions tenderer , like a new wound and the effect was only on the negative emotions i didn t benefit from any super highs , no fits of uncontrollable happiness only rage , sadness , and self pity it was like it worsened the depression i thought that perhaps my body just needed to adjust so i went ahead and stuck with it but it was always temporary and negative for the hours after my dosage i was always just on the edge of a meltdown and just about the time that that feeling would wear off it would be time for another dosage i never experienced and overall lightening of spirit like i hoped i would i finally stopped taking it after i got in a huge fight with a co worker i had indeed been inconvenienced by her but i completely overreacted luckily we didn t work in the same department because i really never could look at her again so , what s it all mean ? don t take this to mean that i think that st john s wort with most things i m a majority opinion kind of guy if so many people find relief with it then there most be something to it it just didn t work for me there s another , somewhat conspiratorial possibility since the fda doesn t see fit to regulate herbal remedies it could be that i had a bad batch it could be that it wasn t st john s wort at all maybe i was taking lawn clippings and my depression produced a predictably negative placebo effect i keep an herbal garden and thought i d try growing the stuff but friends and family like to come over , point at different plants , and ask what is that ? remember , my diagnosis was depression caused by social anxiety think i m willing to just grow my remedy where everyone can see ? my wife knows that i m depressed i told her when i went to that clinic but we never talk about it she bought me a book once but that s been it other than that i just don t talk to anyone about it i didn t even tell her when i tried the st john s wort there s not a chance that i m going to try to grow the stuff the only other herbal remedy that i tried was indeed from my garden i cracked my copy of rodale s illustrated encyclopedia to herbs and read up on everything that i was already growing it turned out that quite a few of my culinary herbs were also traditional remedies for depression or melancholy i went to the local health food store and bought a couple of cups of bulk green tea then harvested large amounts of the alleged happy herbs i can t remember all of the herbs that i used but i know that rosemary and lavender were among them i know lavender isn t culinary it s my only none culinary herb i just love the look and smell of it i mixed them with the green tea leaves and started drinking the tea it tasted absolutely horrible i m making a face as i write this at the memory nothing i did to it could make it taste better in the end i drank it with lots of honey the honey didn t take the taste away with enough honey it just made the tea taste like honey and something horrible though it did manage to make it a bit more drinkable but here s the thing i really made me feel happier content , really for a couple of hours after choking down a pot of the stuff i really did feel better i actually still have quite a lot of the stuff and i ve almost thrown it out a few times but can t bring myself to because it really does help unfortunately i also can t bring myself to drinking it , either so , i started writing this post with the idea that i would announce a decision to try st john s wort again the thinking being that now i work at home i ll give it another try but why turn my back on the tea ? i think that i ll try to start drinking it again i m pretty sure that the green tea is a big part of what i don t like about it i will go to the store and find a different base like plain black tea and mix up some more of the stuff or maybe i will try it with just the herbs and no tea leaves some rose hips , dried apple or cranberries might just give it the lift that it needs i will also do a better job this time of cleaning the herbs part of the problem is that there is a bit on dirt on some of the leaves where i didn t clean them very well there s nothing worse than getting dirt in your teeth when you drink a cup of tea the only problem with this is that it is a temporary fix one day of me not feeling like having my tea or being out of town could spin me right down into the depths again if my problem is a chemical imbalance as big pharm would have us all believe then whatever remedy i find needs to be maintained but if it s all in my mind , as opposed to the physical brain , then using the temporary fix of a chemical high from herbs on most days could be enough to bring about the right kind of change in my overall disposition tea it is , then for now i ll choke down the nasty stuff until i have a chance to go to the store and mix up some more i ll let you know how it goes
