ten days of feeling like a person and boom ! an imbroglio with kathleen and i find myself crying monday morning over the rupture , which appeared to trigger my underlying depression despite the neutral tones of adderall i also cut my wellbutrin dose in half for three days , having been too lazy to refill it , not knowing if my doctor wanted me to stay on it yes , i know better , i should never alter a single milligram of anything in my regimen when improvement occurs but let 's not forget that i am a mental patient this is the interface of biology and psychology there is a kindling effect in both mania and depression , whereby the more times the brain has been exposed to an extreme mood , the easier it is to provoke its recurrence i got my feelings deeply hurt by the one i love i reduced the dosage of only one of five psychoactive medications and that just for three days days dominated by a reason for sadness everyone knows i'm in love with kathleen song naked among the stars , whose center should we choose ? orbiting you makes me committed to planethood you are my cleansing sun scour my atmosphere as water loves stone , wear me like a river i was near tears again yesterday and today but did not indulge my lacrimation my sadness may be normal but my brain is not , thus it tuned in too assiduously to the depressive channel after a brief exposure to one of its frequencies c'est domage not rated , ce
