okay , while our presidential candidates are debating , i thought i would link to an article by a former state legislator in how i helped create a flawed mental health system that failed millions and my son , paul gianfriddo talks about his decades long attempts to help his ill son , a young man who sounds to have mental health and educational needs that could n't be met by a system with limitations gianfriddo writes the s was the decade when many of the state s large psychiatric hospitals were emptied we had the right idea after years of neglect , the hospitals programs and buildings were in decay but we didn t always understand what we were doing in my new legislative role , i jumped at the opportunity to move people out of those places through my subcommittee , i initiated funding for community mental health and substance abuse treatment programs for adults , returned young people from institution based special school districts to schools in their hometowns , and provided for care coordinators to help manage the transition of people back into the community but we legislators in connecticut and many other states made a series of critical misjudgments that have haunted us all ever since first , we didn t understand how poorly prepared the public school systems were to educate children with serious mental illnesses in regular schools and classrooms second , we didn t adequately fund community agencies to meet the new demand for community mental health services ultimately forcing our county jails to fill the void and third , we didn t realize how important it would be to create collaborations among educators , primary care clinicians , mental health professionals , social services providers , and even members of the criminal justice system , if people with serious mental illnesses were to have a reasonable chance of living successfully in the community during the twenty five years since , i ve experienced firsthand the devastating consequences of these mistakes the story about his son is heart breaking and there is no happy ending i 'll leave you to read the whole article and see what you think and if you 'd like to check it out , mr gianfriddo blogs , often about mental health issues , at our health policy matters
