one of many things i love about recovery is that it has taught me that i do not always need to express my opinion something that before recovery i did all too often i now practice exercising control over my speech muscles this may sound simple , but for nervous people this is not always easy for example , i recently had dinner with friends at a chain restaurant my companions said their food was delicious , but i found mine to be wanting yet instead of complaining , i chose to talk about something else , thereby not ruining my friends experience or making them feel guilty about selecting the restaurant before recovery i would have felt compelled to share my opinion of the meal although there would be nothing wrong with doing so , i decided that i would find it difficult to critique the restaurant without temper thus , i was group minded by letting my friends enjoy dinner without my temperamental expression that , admittedly , is a fairly simple example , but i have found other situations in which exercising control over my speech muscles was very valuable , such as when my boss says something i disagree with when i m anxious about something and want to talk it up with others when someone expresses a political opinion with which i am very opposed to in each situation i ve decided that the temperamental outburst would not only not be in the group s interest , but also would lead to a temperamental reaction i d later regret if i allowed myself to express temper in any of these scenarios , i would later worry that i said something i shouldn t have , that i made someone angry at me , that i am burdening someone with my problems , and so on however , my recovery training has taught me the value of controlling my speech muscles now i let the temperamental flare quickly rise and fall , avoiding the compulsion to say what is on my mind and my mental health is better off because of this self control
