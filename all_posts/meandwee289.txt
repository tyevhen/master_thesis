hi friends ! today i will show you paige 's corner for art we got a melissa and doug easel that has a white board on one side and a chalk board on the other it also holds a roller of paper in between and it feeds up through over the white board paige has been loving using her crayons on this she can do big strokes and scribbles with abandon i never considered using an easel before i figured she 'd be fine coloring in an art pad while sitting in her chair it was fine for crayons though she did n't do much for scribbling the pad would move all around under her hand also , when she tried to paint , her fist would just go through the wet paint and smear around the easel keeps her hands up away from the work surface she seems so much happier with it this way , and it 's neater for her having studied art professionally , i think it 's important for children to have a space to create and experiment so far so good ! also pictured is the container of beans paige plays in mentioned a few posts back the artwork over it is a scan from a child 's book that i printed on large paper and framed you 'll see behind the easel that we have some magnetic letters stuck to the wall we did a few coats of magnetic paint in the entire corner from the floor to a few feet up those particular magnets do n't work so great , but the thin kids of magnets seem to stick well i hope to design and create some magnetic play sets scenes for p to play with i know we could have done chalkboard paint over it , but i feel funny encouraging paige to write draw on the walls i would think it would be confusing to a little child you can write on the wall here but not there i decided to keep the festivities to the easel for simplicity 's sake so , that 's the art corner ! save you might also like reading corner toy area playroom a beginning linkwithin
