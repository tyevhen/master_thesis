i'm sure you 've noticed , if you do any significant amount of writing and maybe even if you do n't , it 's much easier to write a decent beginning than a satisfying ending here , i'm talking about short form nonfiction blogs , essays , book reports , campaign speeches , and the like wait did i say nonfiction ? delete campaign speeches notice i did not say beginnings are easy if they were , my earlier piece on how to write an opening sentence probably would n't have gotten , page views no , my friend , beginnings are tough but a good ending is harder usually most always why is that ? why should an ending be any harder than a beginning ? maybe it 's because of how the brain works thoughts about a subject do n't just sudddenly , neatly end more often than not , you go on rehashing and rethinking things with no clear end the end happens when something else , some more pressing set of thoughts , intercedes our lives , our thoughts , are not full of neat resolutions g k chesterton had a charming way of inverting logic to prove the absurdity of things the easiest kind of writing to wrestle to the ground is the argumentative essay here , you can sum up , recap , return to the beginning , restate the thesis , or say something like in the end , it all comes down to x either we accept x , or we do n't but if we reject x we have to be willing to accept y and that 's something most people are n't ready to swallow or some such nonsense it is sometimes though not as often as you 'd think profitable to begin a piece of nonfiction writing with a famous quotation in reality , quotations work much better in a conclusion you could , for example , invoke g k chesterton chesterton once said of christianity , it is not that christianity has been tried and found wanting it has been found difficult , and left untried after quoting chesterton , you can say and so it is with x for all the well meaning talk about x , it has yet to be tried or perhaps it is time x is tried in earnest follow with if it fails , we 'll know soon enough or if it fails , we will at least have tried something reasonable before going back to business as usual , which we already know does n't work one of the most satisfying endings of all times occurs in the final sentence of nora ephron 's classic esquire essay , a few words about breasts also available in pdf form here the essay ends this way after i went into therapy , a process that made it possible for me to tell total strangers at cocktail parties that breasts were the hang up of my life , i was often told that i was insane to have been bothered by my condition i was also frequently told , by close friends , that i was extremely boring on the subject and my girl friends , the ones with nice big breasts , would go on endlessly about how their lives had been far more miserable than mine their bra straps were snapped in class they couldn t sleep on their stomachs they were stared at whenever the word mountain cropped up in geography and evangeline , good god what they went through every time someone had to stand up and recite the prologue to longfellow s evangeline stand like druids of eld with beards that rest on their bosoms it was much worse for them , they tell me they had a terrible time of it , they assure me i don t know how lucky i was , they say i have thought about their remarks , tried to put myself in their place , considered their point of view i think they are full of shit what i like about this ending is not just that it 's personal , direct , and honest , but that it tapers down to a single , short , final statement , ending in a hot button word shit i saw a fine college admission essay recently in which the entire essay read like one of those dos equis commercials the most interesting man in the world , which is to say , it was chock full of self aggrandizing hyperbole , outrageous stuff like i once caught a meteor in my bare hand i taught a unicorn to use the obamacare website when i met chuck norris , i taught him to curtsy i have actually identified ufos i 've done this ridiculous thing , i 've done that ridiculous thing the final sentence of the essay was but i have not yet gone to college he got in if you 're writing something right now and are struggling for an ending , try this keep just what you 've got , but add a short knock out punch statement , either at the end of the final paragraph , or as its own paragraph note , by the way , that nora ephron 's final sentence would have worked quite well as its own one line paragraph it 's much harder to find a tidy ending for an open ended discussion for example , a book review or other piece of writing that 's not inherently argumentative one possible strategy is to juxtapose the subject 's strengths and weaknesses in death of a platypus , frumpenheimer reveals himself to be a master of irony and an erudite student of the history of mime what he lacks in humility , he makes up for in logic , and charm he weds the wit of thurber with the iconoclasm of stein the overall effect is arresting , mesmerizing , and sublime or the overall effect is not to be found in any other writer of the late twentieth century , optionally followed up with which is why frumpenheimer will be studied for decades , maybe centuries , to come notice how breaking a sentence with commas near the very end causes the pace to slow , then stop compare the effect of ending the frumpenheimer sentence at decades commas are small pauses they 're like tapping the brakes as you get to the end of your essay , start tapping the brakes i have often found it useful , when trying to bring a discussion to a close , to employ the multi stage retro rocket approach this calls for a medium length paragraph that sets up a short next to last paragraph , which in turn sets up a one sentence final paragraph it 's like the retro rocket that precedes the parachute that precedes the bouncy balls on the martian lander martian lander pattern paragraph x retro rocket it 's not enough to consider a or to argue b a and b make for powerful arguments , until you consider q and r and then they do n't have the same impact paragraph y parachute the fact is , a needs to be reconsidered in the light of s then we may find out t paragraph z bouncy ball the alternative , u , is unthinkable another pattern is to end with an anecdote , then tie it back into the discussion or you can speculate history does n't record whether so and so ever thought about the consequences of such and such he she they certainly could n't have foreseen abc but here we are , still trying to grapple with the problem of xyz no doubt , future generations of experts will continue to grapple with it , for years to come optionally one can hope the next generation of pqr will find the progress that has eluded the current generation of pqr or see the problem in a new , and more profitable , light or not encounter the same stumbling blocks that make abc such a impasse today or whatever listen to the rhythm learn to recognize when the ball has n't rolled to a complete stop quite often , what you 've written , thinking or wishing you 've nailed the last sentence , is n't really the last sentence in my recent essay on the new weird the new weird being an emerging but fundamentally stillborn , imho literary genre , i had written , toward the end it 's not enough for fiction to permutate and pervert the past and serve it up again in shocking colors serve us up something new i so wanted to be able to end it right there but i could tell , from the cadence , that the ball had not yet stopped rolling more needed to be said i could have added something tasty something memorable but it still would n't have felt finished i could have added more i want to sup for hours , and be filled for days as it is now , i feel malnourished not working the ball 's still rolling i decided to add yet another short paragraph try to make paragraphs shorter , near the end sentences too claues within sentences , also give the reader subverbal cues that momentum is in fact gradually , gradually , slowing i'm still not happy with the final additional paragraph i came up with as a reader of fiction , i want to move beyond tolkien in a party dress i want the next new weird to come without a rearview mirror the current new weird is n't doing it for me arguably , the final sentence could have worked better as its own standalone paragraph possible rewrite call me old normal , but the new weird is n't doing it for me possibly , i could have added yet another additional final sentence , as its own paragraph then again , maybe i'm just being weird i could 've used the circle back technique how ? add a new starting sentence as its own paragraph to the top of the essay if i had to sum myself up in one word , as a reader of fiction , i'm fussy then end the essay with a one sentence paragraph after all the previous bellyaching like i said at the beginning i'm fussy in short some possible ways to end a piece of writing by no means an all inclusive list ! make a statement at the beginning of the piece , with an explicit aim of returning to it at the end the ending revisits the beginning end with a question make a statement of how things should be , and then ask is n't that what most people mean by xyz ? perhaps add the question is n't whether we can afford to do xyz , but whether we can afford not to end with a warning if we do n't do xyz , maybe we deserve what we get or maybe the so and sos will win out after all , and then archie bunker will be king , and we 'll all be happy and live forever new paragraph probably not , though suggest a reason for hope tell how a situation can be improved , then maybe then we 'll have a free society worthy of the name with liberty and justice for all use a quotation , either as the final statement or the beginning of the final paragraph after which , you explain why it sums up the subject in question issue a call for action there 's no reason the biggest retail corporations in the world should pay less than a subsistence wage minimum wage workers of the world , unite ! restate the thesis in the light of everything that 's been disussed given the fact that xyz , the question is n't a , but b optionally follow up with and that 's a choice that might not sit well with the majority of people americans voters politicians puppeteers use retro rockets instead of a concluding paragraph , write three paragraphs , each one successively shorter tap the brakes make your final few sentences short , or if it 's a long sentence break it up with commas when in doubt , write half a dozen endings keep the one that deserves to live then come back a day later , club that one to death , and write the real conclusion
