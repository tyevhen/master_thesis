recently i have been invited to join the regular stable of writers who blog at psychology today i'm very happy to go forward and represent , to some extent , the paleolithic community with this wider exposure i'm also pleased by the intriguing work done by the other bloggers there fortunately , i have complete editorial control over the content of the articles i will begin by updating and cross posting some of my better entries over there , but i may end up putting wholly original material there also the blogging over there also pays by the page view seeing as how i just bought a new thyroid textbook , please do me a favor and go have a look ! welcome to evolutionary psychiatry thanks so much to dr kurt harris for recommending me , and putting me on his blogroll , which is apparently how the editor at pt found my blog did n't mention it at first as i did n't want to spoil his own announcement ! however , it does make the opportunity doubly exciting , as the potential to reach the mainstream with panu 's gift for turn of phrase is just amazing
