i was able to get the computer repaired for after ripping the phone jack out of it accidentally the shop could n't fix it i would have had to send it back to the factory but for the above price , i got another card with a phone jack that slips in where my wireless card also goes so my guiness record for continuing sonnets continues mr faust he dead the kettle barbecue is slick with rain redwood fronds surround it up above clouds feather in and out white pinions strain , give way to sun and cover it as they move my heart is open i have no regrets worthy of crucifixion i am whole and wounded i have paid off all my debts though not a betting man my given role of doctor , teacher , writer , i accept we all must own aspects we didn t plan for no one grows up wanting to be a janitor i have no reputation to protect my former dreams of prominence now amuse me no seraphim in white could disabuse me it 's my birthday tomorrow , the big , no more excuses , i'm playing with a full deck a little melancholy today , maybe kilorats thine in truth and art , craig erick
