i went salsa dancing like i promised myself three weeks ago i really enjoyed it i did two lessons and then the had a live band until am i did the classes and the women had to keep moving on so we danced with all the men i did both the lessons which were really great i then decided to get a drink at the bar before going home i danced with three different men after the class one of the men walked me back to my car ! ! ! the first man was in my beginners class but he was not a strong enough partner to lead me and was too short so i just had the one dance with him the next man asked me to dance but was not impressed that i did not know all the steps finally the last guy i danced with i stayed with for a while he has had a bout lessons and i got better with him through the evening he ended up walking me back to my car which was nice i intend to go again next week as i really enjoyed it i am watching 'the girl with a pearl earing' now i am still buzzing from the dancing ! ! night !
