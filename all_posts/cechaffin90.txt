i feel i am being stretched too thin by my blog , my red room blog , my wisefire page , facebook , twitter and the ongoing promotion of my book i feel stretched out into the ether and take my therapy in gardening and nature walks except for my blog , i 've been hornswaggled into these other platforms by people , like my publisher , who insisted they were invaluable in ongoing publicity on the web i 've even been tweeting a poem or two on twitter line by line who reads it i do n't know i do know i have very little time to read all the stuff that comes my way and still have a life in the real world net overload ? but what else would i do with my time ? plenty , i suppose yet this carnival of digital souls is a wonder and presages a new world , an even smaller world , where if you want , i suppose , you can know the kind of underwear britney has chosen immediately afterwards i confess that when i read our local paper , the press democrat of sonoma , i often glance first at the celebrity page on the inside of the front cover many of the celebrities i 've never heard of , which bespeaks my age , but news about others comfort me like weather reports and then there 's always the downfall of the mighty which we all secretly wish the question is , how much does this exhalation into the ether affect your personality ? no doubt it leads to a form of cybernarcissism , where our thoughts and deeds are magnified by the easy utility of web platforms obama used this with great aplomb , but he had monkeys typing to do it , or more the age of the sound bite has now produced tweeting , the new path to notoriety who will be the champion tweeter ? who cares ? can you imagine blogging with the stars ? or tweeting with the rolling stones ? smart , current marketing people urge a web presence , and i had an article written about me ten years ago entitled , a presence on the net has my presence increased ? actually , since stopping the melic review in , my presence has decreased , as i am no longer an editor at large whom writers aim to please now i am just like any other poet submitting to journals , with no special powers ending melic when i did seemed right , but i wish i had the team to resurrect it it 's all about finding a literary webmaster , no small ticket to be fair , i did transition to blogging , though a little late , yet my highest average readership has been around if i do n't post frequently it naturally drops friday i 'll announce the winners of the poetry contest if there are any laggers who still want to submit , send your best poem to cechaffin at gmail dot com the winners will receive a signed hardback copy of unexpected light , a book you simply must have if you 've been a reader of this blog it has many poems where i deal with the demon of depression that i blogged about here two years running my wife gave me a great gift the other day if i would wash the dishes nightly , she would take over the finances i ca n't tell you how grateful i am to have that burden off of my back i have been awful at it , as i'm sure my credit score would reflect , but you ca n't be good at everything in fact , i have a neurosis about money it always seemed to make my family of origin unhappy god has always provided for me and my family and i thank him for it given my level of poor budgeting and living hand to mouth , it surely is a miracle to have such a burden lifted for the first time in my adult life a helpmate indeed ! easily worth my dishwater hands kiloneutral but a little anxious , ce
