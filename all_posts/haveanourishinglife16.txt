the past is in the past , but gosh darn it , i should have been taking an antidepressant years ago i do n't know what i was waiting for someone to tell me to ? a good feeling that i was doing the right thing ? a sign from god ? the right timing ? or maybe it would just go away ? please god just let it go away i realized i would never get that it 's ok feeling to take medicine but i know i was waiting i knew deep down that i could really benefit from trying out the medicine again my stubbornness coupled with my family of origin caused me to resist help for a long time family of origin a term described to me by a counselor a while ago is how we have been shaped by our families it is not necessarily a bad or good thing , just something that you should be aware of especially when joining two families together in marriage most of my family habits are good things , because i was raised in a wonderful family hilarious example , in my family , when we were sick with a stomach bug , we had towels by our bed or on our pillow to throw up in if we could n't make it to the bathroom i did n't realize that no one else really did that in my husbands family , they had buckets or bowls like most people neither way is right or wrong , they 're just different if i think my way is always right , then by default , the other way is always wrong which can cause a lot of problems in a relationship obviously it is best to be truly open to other ideas , think things through , and challenge yourself when necessary because of my foo , i realized that i was holding onto beliefs about taking medicine in my extended family and in a lot of families , medicine has this kind of stigma my perception is that if you take medication you are weak , lazy , a failure , going to die of cancer at a young age , or just plain pitiable i do n't know where i learned this i do n't know how or when i think it 's just a gradual process learned from many conversations over the years and maybe its just my perception of the perception i could very well be projecting my fears onto other people thoughts regardless , i am embarrassed i am embarrassed to be taking an antidepressant i am embarrassed to admit to my family that i am depressed and i need to take medication i am actually even afraid to tell anyone that i am depressed and taking medication i had known for a while that things were not good and i needed some help unfortunately , no one was going to be able to convince me that going to counseling and taking medicine was the right thing to do no one could walk me through it , holding my hand telling me it would be ok i would never get those good feelings that i was making the right decision no one would do it for me and no one would make me feel ok about doing it i had to make the call i had to show up at the assessment appointment , then again at the psychiatrist appointment i had to pick up my prescription at the drug store then , i have to go back to the counseling center and pharmacy every few months i had to battle myself every time and still do then why did i make my own decision ? i really do n't know why and i really do n't know how i just did the grace of god maybe ? i do n't know why some people suffering from depression decide to take care of themselves while others decide to commit suicide it 's awful it breaks my heart there is so much i do n't understand but i think it would help if we got rid of this medication stigma so people are n't so darn afraid of taking medicine that could save their life
