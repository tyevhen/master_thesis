the preamble of our constitution states , we the people of the united states , in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defense , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america tomorrow is independence day , unfortunately , i have to ask what happened to our country ? it appears sir john dalberg acton was right power tends to corrupt , and absolute power corrupts absolutely the united states is a melting pot , a fusion of nationalities , cultures , and ethnicities different elements melting together for the common good of all i m certain our foundering fathers couldn t agree on everything each representative probably thought their way was the best for the country yet , they were able to set aside their differences and come together to create a nation they knew the united states would not be perfect , nothing ever is but , it would be far better than the alternatives they forged a nation that allows everyone to have an opinion to practice their own beliefs to disagree without fear of retaliation these are our rights not everything has to be an all or nothing situation compromise shouldn t be considered a weakness meeting somewhere in the middle allows for win win situations for the common good of all i wish you a safe and happy th of july photo th of july gtaphic wjbf com
