a few weeks ago it was a slow motion rollercoaster depression , that is i had plenty of instability , sharp turns , peaks , valleys , and loop de loops , but there was no speed , no urgency , no excitement , no stimulation , and definitely no , weeeeeee ! today , my ride has drastically changed ! i either jumped tracks from the kiddie carts to the big kid coaster , or someone flipped that giant red switch you know , the one that says danger underneath it 'cuz i am screaming along the tracks ! screaming and trust me , it 's not , weeeeee you 'll hear hurtling from within ! no , i believe i 've skipped the , weeeee , and gone straight to , aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh , and whhhhhooooooooooaaaaaaaaaa ! do n't get me wrong i love rides , especially rollercoasters i love that feeling of being out of control screaming along the tracks , getting tossed about , bounced around , jerked out of my seat and snapped back down love it but when it comes to my brain daily bouncing , jerking , and snapping about within my skull not so fabulous ! and that 's the ride my depression has now chosen i 've gone from too slow to too fast without a sniff of a hot dog and coke at the scenic overlook of just right that just does n't seem right when do i get to choose the ride ? when do i get to drive ? i would n't mind a coke and a pretty view once in awhile
