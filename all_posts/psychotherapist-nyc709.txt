overcoming feelings of inadequacy can be very challenging , especially if you 've been feeling this way for many years there can be many causes for feeling inadequate , including early childhood trauma , an abusive spouse , a boss who is a bully , and so on often , people who are feeling inadequate know in their rational minds that there is no objective reason for feeling this way i 've had clients , who are quite accomplished and who are looked up to by many others , who still feel inadequate they might hide it well when they 're around other people , but deep down inside , they still feel worthless overcoming feelings of inadequacy talking about it in therapy often goes nowhere people who feel inadequate can often identify what triggers their feelings of inadequacy and even pinpoint early trauma that precipitated their feelings of worthlessness but this is often not enough to help them overcome their negative feelings about themselves if anything , it 's usually very frustrating because then they wonder , if they can see objectively that there is no rational reason for their feelings , why they still persist in feeling this way i was originally trained as a psychoanalyst i still love psychoanalysis and , when clients come to me requesting psychoanalysis , i work in a contemporary , dynamic way as opposed to classical psychoanalysis but i 've found , over the years , that psychoanalysis and regular talk therapy is often not sufficient , by itself , to help clients overcome feelings of inadequacy i have found over the years that mind body oriented psychotherapy , like clinical hypnosis , emdr , and somatic experiencing are much more helpful to overcome feelings of worthlessness and low self esteem overcoming feelings of inadequacy these mind body oriented psychotherapies help clients to access their strengths and power to heal in a much more profound and effective way getting help in therapy to find out more about emdr , somatic experiencing and clinical hypnosis , you can go to the following professional websites clinical hypnosis http asch net somatic experiencing http traumahealing com emdr http emdria org i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , who is certified in mind body oriented psychotherapy i work with individual adults and couples to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at
