i don t know about you , but after a serious fall that involved an injury , getting back on the horse is no easy task yes , i know it needed to be done , but i constantly asked myself , am i ready ? after two weeks of sponge baths , yesterday i decided i was ready to take a shower i thought i was ready on monday , but i second guessed myself and put it off yesterday , when i came back from taking my dog for a walk i ride and he walks , i told my wife , let s do it during the process of undressing and preparing to step into the shower , there were several moments that i paused and considered if this was the right time to try it my metatarsal still isn t healed nor is the sprain and , the left hyper flexed knee still gives me some problems should i wear a shoe to protect the foot ? what happens if i do more damage stepping into or out of the shower ? what if my left knee and foot won t hold all of my weight ? what kept my moving forward was the affirmation , come on , bruce , you ve done this a thousand times just get it done i find it interesting how my mind works from day two after the injury , i started exercising the legs this wasn t my regular routine just side to side shifts i added ten each day until i was up to reps next i added standing leg lifts i started small , but within a week i was up to of them so far so good i began taking my dog out transferring to and from the golf cart was another milestone in the recovery process everything went very well and ahead of schedule but , taking a shower was the one thing i continued to put off okay , now that the shower is behind me , i am one step closer to the day i can say fully recovered whew !
