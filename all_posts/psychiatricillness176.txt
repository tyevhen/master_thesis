my car is still really poorly , i have started looking at new cars and i am taking the train to work at the moment i really like getting the train as it makes me stick to a routine and stops me working late i also get to go back to sleep for a while instead of spending over an hour stressed and stuck in traffic the train is also cheaper so it is better all around iam looking for a new car although i have had to spend about just to stop it falling apart it still needs brakes and tyres and all drying out the headlights are also messing around now so i just want to get shot of it !
