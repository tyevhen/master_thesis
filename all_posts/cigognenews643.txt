when scientists were polled recently about the greatest discovery in science , the majority chose darwin s evolution it explained so much in so many fields of scientific endeavor that includes psychotherapy in my opinion evolution is essential in the treatment of emotional problems to put it differently , no one can make significant progress in psychotherapy when evolution is not central to its process the brain developed in three major cycles , first described by paul maclean i describe them as instinct energy , feeling and then thinking each evolved and has many connections to higher levels if we do a therapy with only the last evolved that is , cognitive insight therapy , we have neglected a great deal of our evolution it is tantamount to neglecting most of our ancient history and , of course , most of our early personal history when we ignore two thirds of our brain how can we possibly get well ? i think that the thinkers the cognitive insight therapists cure their patients so that they think they are better this leaves out physiology and feeling therefore , we need to systematically measure physiologic changes in our psychotherapy otherwise , we can have great new attitudes but our bodies may be degenerating i have often called my therapy , evolution in reverse it includes evolution as its kernel and it is that sense of evolution that makes it revolutionary because it overturns most current thinking about the value of thinking , particularly in terms of measuring progress in psychotherapy what we feel is what we feel no matter what exhortations take place and those often buried feelings determine our actions feelings can be deviated but there is always a home for them in the brain they cannot be changed though we can change our thinking about them , denying or projecting them thoughts , bereft of feelings are , in essence , homeless they have no roots so any proper psychotherapy must adhere to the laws of biology and evolution we need to find our roots , the basis of some many of our thoughts and beliefs the history of mankind is found in us today , and the history of man us is found in us , as well when we follow our history in reverse it again must adhere to the natural order of things in therapy if we do rebirthing it defies evolutionary principles by attacking the most remote and early imprints first we must start in the present , give ourselves a good foundation in regard to our current lives and associated feelings and then finally arrive at the reptilian instinctive brain a long time later these are biologic laws that cannot be disregarded thus it is clear that rebirthing cannot ever work indeed it most likely creates damage and i have seen and treated the damage it does any ploy or mechanism by a therapist that defies evolution will end in failure because evolution is merciless and unrelenting it is how we survived it will not allow us to cheat on its principles if evolution is neglected it will perforce end in abreaction the release of feeling without connection and resolution bioenergetics , focusing the body and muscles violates that law focusing on bodily release the gestalt therapy , act like an ape ! is inadequate lsd and hallucinogens completely disregard the neurologic order of the nervous system , and spray feelings everywhere with no possible connection a primal will teach us evolution because it will follow the neuraxis precisely and tell us where and how evolution took place
