july i honestly cannot remember what i did , so it must have been a boring day either that or i'm really too tired to be writing this ! oh wait ! i remember it rained beautiful sheets of water falling down thunder booming storms fill me with energy , they make me feel alive i also danced around being very hyper and annoying everyone july we went to my grandmothers house to see my great grandmother , age nearly , off she was heading to her birthplace of gaspe with her son she owns a nice old house there , right next to the house she was born in nearly a century ago cool , eh ? amazingly , she 's still with it a good portion of the time this particular visit she knew exactly who we were and what was going on i felt bad for her since she was scared of traveling she hates pretty much any form of travel and always has ! after she was picked up , we just spent time with my grandma for a while you might also like grandma 's and books a trip to grandma 's , much conversation , and some good old tlh christmas celebrations christmas ' linkwithin
