a very unusual and surprising property of protein coding genes is that if a codon a appears with a certain frequency in genes , the reverse complement codon of a will also have a similar frequency of occurrence for example if ctt leucine appears at a frequency of , the reverse complement codon aag lysine will also appear at roughly if cgt arginine appears at , acg threonine will appear at around these are whole genome frequencies this correlation is strongest r for organisms with a high genomic g c content , such as streptomyces griseus , and lowest r in low gc organisms like clostridium botulinum this is a very peculiar property , when you think about it we do n't usually imagine an organism being constrained in its choice of codons for a particular protein if a particular protein calls for a huge amount of leucines cttcttctt we do n't imagine that there 's a requirement for an equivalent quantity of aag to be used somewhere else and yet , the correlation between frequency of occurrence of a codon and its antisymmetric twin is , as i say , surprisingly high in many organisms this sort of thing is very hard to explain without invoking a theory of proteogenesis that involves antisense proteins imagine a poly lysine gene of aaa repeated times the gene gets duplicated on the opposite strand now the original strand has aaas and a run of ttts if a reading frame opens up on the ttt stretch and the protein is beneficial to the organism it survives , there is now codon anticodon parity of the kind i'm describing , between codons in the poly lysine gene and the poly phenylalanine ttt gene why does this relationship hold for high gc organisms but not as much for low gc organisms ? probably because antisense genes in high at organisms contain a lot of stop codons taa , tga , tag , which by the way occur at about the same frequencies as tta , tca , and cta , respectively the presence of few stop codons in high gc antisense genes gives those genes a chance to be expressed and evolve further of course , if you buy this theory , it tends to argue for a gc world scenario in which the early proteosome evolved from gc rich double stranded genomes to illustrate the unusual correlation i'm talking about , i took the codon frequencies of pseudomonas fluorescens pf genome wide and made a graph that plots the frequency of occurrence of each codon on the x axis , versus the frequency of occurrence of the corresponding reverse complement codon on the y axis so if cta occurs at and tag occurs at , i plot a point at , the svg graph below is interactive you should be able to hover over a point and see a tooltip that shows the identity of the corresponding codon , and its reverse twin , and their respective frequencies note if your browser does not support svg , a png copy of the graph is here the symmetry pattern is expected for every codon anticodon there 's a corresponding anticodon codon pair with frequencies swapped what 's more important than the symmetry pattern is the fact that frequency values in y increase monotonically in x and vice versa , with a correlation coefficient in this case of r f statistic , p this means that codons tend to occur at about the same frequencies as their reverse complement codons there are outliers , to be sure , but the overall trend is statistically solid stroke linecap square stroke linejoin round leave a comment if you have any thoughts on what 's going on here
