photo from here it s called panic sometimes , my brain doesn t know how to react in a certain situation , whether it s from inexperience , an unknown , change , something that scares me , or no reason at all after these triggers , my mind decides to act somewhat like a child when i thought about it , the experience is very much like my brain is a year old throwing a temper tantrum things aren t going my way and the only way i know how to cope is to panic after years of giving in to these episodes , the habitual reactions are formed and set the outcome panic attacks , and a life of anxiety i don t want to come across as insensitive i m not saying that if you struggle with anxiety you are immature no , panic attacks are a real adult problem and many people suffer from them this analogy is only to serve as a possible way to help you overcome them for example , i often have panic attacks before i m about to leave the house i am afraid of forgetting something i ll need while i m away i m afraid of encountering a circumstance i won t know how to handle or i m afraid of worst case scenario problems that might arise , you know , like the house burning down , my car breaking down , or running into someone i know at the store i have found that one way to help overcome panic attacks is to think of them as the brain throwing a temper tantrum to stop the tantrum , you would treat it as you would treat a year old don t engage i learned this technique from the blog article , five more ways of coping with panic by therese borchard , who has long suffered from depression and anxiety i don t have kids , but i ve babysat many a temper tantruming two year olds and i know the best way to diffuse the situation is to ignore it the more you engage in the fit , the more you encourage it to go on part of the reason for the tantrum is to get attention , so if no attention is given to it , the temper subsides depending on how old the child is , later maybe after a nap or some food , you can have a rational discussion concerning the behavior reflecting on this example , i think , i can also learn how to deal with panic attacks when you are experiencing a panic attack , most of the time , your brain is on hyper sensitive mode your mind is reacting out of fear , so all the senses are engaged and participating in the ordeal it feels scary and all you want to do is give in and let the panic attack win thus , repeating a vicious cycle , ever bringing you down however , if you decide not to engage in the panic , ignoring the feelings of extreme anxiety , and go about what you were doing , it is highly likely that you will live through the situation by going through the motions , and leading with your body , your brain will catch up and soon forget what it was so upset about in the first place treat it like you would a little kid s tantrum blow it off , walk out of the room , and don t engage this change in behavior will be very difficult at first but the more you do this , the more your brain will mature with time and practice , you will begin to re train your brain to handle those non emergency situations in a calm way in the moment , your brain is not capable of rationally thinking through the panic attack however , when all is said and done maybe after a nap and some foodj , you can think about the situation that caused you panic and have a rational , calm discussion with yourself about your feelings and what caused you fear this is from therese s article , a study published in journal of neuroscience showed that there is a breakdown in normal patterns of emotional processing that can prevent anxious people from suppressing negative emotions in fact , the more they tried , the more they activated the fear center of their brain , the amygdala , which fed them more negative messages so , there is even a scientific explanation as to why you can t talk yourself out of a panic attack so many times i ve tried to calm myself down by confronting the panic , trying to figure it out , explain it , and rationalize it away in reality , all i was doing was engaging in my brain s temper tantrum , fueling it with more and more fear if you also struggle with panic attacks , i encourage you to try this technique it has worked really well for me and it s also helped me make a lot of positive progress concerning anxiety in general again , i m not trying to dismiss panic and anxiety by reducing it to the level of a toddler i just think that this example can play a positive part in helping us overcome the debilitating anxiety that keeps us from doing the things we love to do
