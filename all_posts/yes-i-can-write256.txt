as the new year approaches , there are a slew of new years memes going around best of 's , daily blogging about the past year i 've looked at them , but really , have n't found anything i want to actually do because what 's really been on my mind , while thinking of the past year , is what i 've learned not everything i 've learned , obviously to try and encapsulate the learning from an entire year into one blog post would be a wee bit difficult but the things i 've learned that really stuck with me , really resonated with me the things i really want to take note of so that 's what i'm going to do things i learned in the year i 've learned that judgments of people , made too quickly and harshly , are very often wrong i keep thinking i 've figured this out already , but then i find myself doing it again dismissing someone because of an opinion they have deciding someone 's mean because of one comment i hate that i do this , and i do n't want to do this , because most of the time , it turns out that the person is really incredibly cool this reaction stems more from fear than anything else , and i finally seem to have figured this out this year , so i'm getting better at meeting people with an open mind and heart i 've learned that grief has a strange beauty to it , despite the pain i 've learned that arguing with people really is n't worth it i have my opinions , and i 'll state them the person i'm talking to can state theirs , and i 'll listen but when it starts to turn into a debate , i no longer want that conversation debates are simply a contest to prove who 's right as if right ness was somehow objective by contest of who has better debating skills i can debate reasonably well , but i hate it it seriously stresses me so i 've learned that while discussions and conversations are wonderful , whether or not the person i'm talking to has similar opinions , debates just end up leaving me stressed without actually accomplishing anything i 've learned that there are a ridiculously large amount of absolutely amazing people in this world i ca n't believe it took me this long to realize just how many of them there are ! i 've learned to be proud of myself i 've learned that becoming an adult , by turning , opens up a whole new world of pressure and expectations yikes ! i 've learned that if you take someone for granted for too long , something will come along that shows you just how important they are i 've learned not to take things for granted i'm still having trouble putting that into practice , but at least it 's something i'm conscious of i 've learned that i'm actually a pretty capable person i think i learned this one a couple of years ago , but it took a while to really get processed , and now i can say that i 've learned , as hard as it is , that i ca n't make other peoples decisions for them it 's their life , and all i can do is give opinions and be supportive the rest is up to them , no matter how bad the choices they make are i 've learned that i'm not nearly as alone as i often think i am it 's been rather rocky year my grandmother was diagnosed with uterine cancer in february , and she went through an operation , chemotherapy , and radiation , followed by a no more cancer diagnoses , during the course of the year she 's the only grandparent that i'm close to , and it was hard for my whole family our dog of many years , flora , passed away in august after being sick for much of the summer i 've had furry family members die before , but only when i was very young it was a hard time i also went through a lot of emotional turmoil this year , over the big question what are you going to do with your life ? i'm afraid that that turmoil is following me into the new year i do n't want to give the impression that this year was all horrible , though , because it was n't this was also a year of some truly wonderful times the northeast unschooling conference was wonderful fun , and i felt truly accepted in a large group for the first time in my life at not back to school camp i also spent countless hours of time with my family , in deep discussions , silly giggling , and quiet companionship they mean so much to me i 've also realized that although i may have very few local friends , the ones i have are very precious to me , and are truly wonderful people it 's been a mixed year one of many challenges , but also much beauty i'm looking forward to this coming year wondering what it might bring , what places i 'll see , what people i 'll meet , what good times i 'll have wishing everyone the best in the coming year ! peace , idzie
