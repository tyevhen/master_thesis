over the past several days , one fact has burst from the shadows and stepped into the clear it is standing there now , chest puffed , hands on hips , bathed in yellow light fact i am not a superhero in the midst of my desperate search for rescue from the recent chaos in my head , this fact splendiferously revealed itself if i was a superhero , the chaos would have been zapped into oblivion by now , and i 'd be walking around in awe of and gratitude for my mystical powers alas , i am not a superhero the chaos seems to be giving way to a crash , and you all know how much i love crashes i am doing everything i can , and everything i am being asked to do well , almost everything i did refuse to go to the er for an evaluation that 's a pretty deep line in my sandbox , and i do not plan to cross it but i have been reaching out , calling , e mailing , talking , texting , and writing and i despise having to make these connections i do n't want to be that person the friend , co worker , or even patient everyone is now concerned about i just want to be me i prefer to be the helper , not the help ee if only a superhero could pull me from my free fall i am not a superhero , and apparently there is n't one ready to catch me from my fall therefore , i 've continued to reach out but the chaos in my head is overwhelming enough without the added pressure of revealing it to multiple people yet i need their support yet revealing my fucked up thoughts and soul crushing feelings increases my fear of losing their support who among them wo n't be stunned and horrified by what 's emerging from this otherwise normal appearing human form the person they know as their likable and funny friend , happy and skilled co worker , or successful and healthy patient their shock and disgust , that is what i fear depression is rarely a socially acceptable , rally around the patient , kind of illness in its ugliest form , as in my case right now , this illness even horrifies me ! my inclination is to keep it all in , wait for it to pass , smile and carry on , or my favorite , fake it until i make it but my thoughts are scary , my friends even here , in the space of my anonymous blog , i do not feel safe revealing their sadistic content for fear of alienation and retribution and the fear of alienation and retribution , that 's probably depression talking , too ! this illness warps my reality as it envelops me in an ever tightening , concentric maze of thoughts and feelings struggling for rationality only solidifies its grip if i keep struggling , the way out will become impossible to figure and desperation will ensue unfortunately , it is only work , collaboration , and patience , not desperation , which will eventually release me from its trap i know that somewhere in my muddled brain , i know that , and i'm doing my best but a superhero would be beneficial , too
