this is a guest post from my buddy jl she discovered folic acid around the same time that i did and has had much better success with it so , to avoid yet another gloomy things still suck post from me which is the case i asked her to tell us about her experiences with it and , when you 're done reading this , go subscribe to her blog , from manic to mindful ray in my years , i can say with full confidence that depression has dominated over of my life i was an incredibly angry and sad little girl oh , how the therapists love to hear that ! , who grew to become an overly eager to please , must be perfect at all times teenager , who finally came down hard at age eighteen , only to be kept afloat on a cocktail of anti depressants and anti anxiety medicine until about eight weeks ago , when i stumbled onto the blog i m writing for now through this blog i found another blog , methodical musings of an unbalanced woman and i discovered folic acid specifically , mthf i ve spent a lot of time on anti depressants to name a few lexapro , cymbalta , zoloft thank you very much for landing me in the hospital , paxil and those are just the ones i remember i spent my longest time on lexapro , and i was pregnant with all three of my children while taking it after my doctor s decided that the benefits outweighed the harm so far so good with my little ones , but i guess time will tell here s the funny thing about anti depressants i was never really not depressed while taking them i was cushioned and functioning better , for sure , but i still always fought that depression so when i had the epiphany , if you will , that the anti depressants were not really doing much for me and acting as a placeholder solution , at best , coupled with increasing difficulties with health insurance to even get said anti depressants , i needed to finally go on that search to nip my depression in the bud , or at least keep it in check , on my own i knew that an answer must be out there when i stumbled on the information about mthf , all i had to read was there are studies that show that a large amount of the population cannot properly break down and absorb folic acid , and those who are unable to do so are prone to depression , anxiety , and anger among other diseases and issues , and i was sold i emailed said bloggers about it and asked them for more information as a girl who loved her illicit drugs while in high school and college , not to mention her booze , not endorsing that behavior , just being honest with you i had zero problem with taking a vitamin supplement i ordered over the internet methylated folic acid , in it s l methylfolate form , is already broken down so that , basically , the work has already been done for those people who are not able to do so because of their genetic deficiency i can t say whether i have said genetic defect or not , since i have not been tested , but i do know that depression runs very heavily in my family , and not only has it been obvious that my maternal grandmother was is severely depressed , so is my mother , me obviously , and i see it in my seven year old son a little more about that in a bit i readily ordered my methyl folate and anxiously awaited its arrival in its early days , and still , today , because i guess we can still say it s still early since almost none of the physicians that i ve discussed this with have any clue about it though evidently research about this began forty years ago methylated folic acid was and still is prescribed to go with anti depressants , to make them more effective i can confirm that this was the case for me , right away happy , joy , grateful wow a whole new world opened up for me immediately i attributed this to the folic acid and combined with the fact that i was so desperate to be off of my meds quickly made an appointment with my doctor to discuss coming off of my antidepressants cymbalta mg twice a day i am not one to wait around for things to happen we agreed on a plan well , she told me a plan and basically forced me to agree , though in my many years with anti depressants i knew that her way to come off of the pills was too fast and i began decreasing my dosage of anti depressants , and kept with the mthf which she knew nothing about , but because she had heard of folic acid , said was fine coming off of those first mgs a day was unusually easy much , much different than coming off of anti depressants had ever been before i was still very much content and yes , even happy this was a very new experience for me but i guess i should also stick in a disclaimer along with the mthf , i began practicing mindful meditation and using the silva method of meditation , which i have committed myself to doing once a day i also stopped drinking alcohol as much as i did before only about a glass a day this wasn t so hard , though , because something interesting happened i didn t want to drink i don t know if it s the folic acid or the meditation or what , but i can t write a truthful post without putting those other parts in as well i have to say that the final that s right a mere three mgs of the cymbalta were the worst i felt like a crack whore coming off of the hooch i have a really good imagination it was awful and i began to wonder if the folic acid really helped at all but i had to remind myself that i have been on anti depressants for more than a decade , and that my adult self has never existed without them , so of course it would be incredibly difficult and that i really needed to cut myself some slack here s what kept me going during that not so long ago time my son , who i mentioned before , is seven and has displayed anger and anxiety ever since he was three part of me always chalked it up to my divorce from his father when he was one , and his anger about my re marriage and the two baby sisters he got as a result of the remarriage but after four years , i finally confronted my excuses for his behavior and accepted the realization that he is probably a depressive , just as i am i do not want this kid on prescription , synthetic , medication , especially at such a young age , and yes , he has been to therapy still willing to give mthf a fighting chance , i decided to see how he would do on it in my research and discussions with other people who take the mthf , i learned that this is one of those supplements that have almost no side effects , and that it benefits basic human functions on so many ways that it is just fine for almost anyone to take , even children but i would definitely research that more before you give our two year old methyl folate or anyone for that matter my son is a big at lbs i felt okay with giving him mgs of the mthf a day not right away , but after a few weeks my son slowly evolved into being a happy kid finally ! ! ! as a parent , this is the one thing you want for your child seeing my guy like this is such an incredible relief for me he still gets angry at times and is as difficult as any other year old boy i hear about , but for the most part our home is so much better he even told me himself that he feels so much nicer when he takes his medicine of course , we have many discussions about how it isn t really a medication but a food supplement just knowing , and seeing what the folic acid has done for him really got me through those incredibly tough days i spent ridding myself of cymbalta now , i come from a family of researchers my father has his phd in chemical engineering , as does my brother most of my parent s friends are either chemists or physicians of some sort i am merely a graphic designer , who has a passion for all things psychological does it matter that my minor in college was in psychology ? ? ? but i do love to do my own research and empower myself by doing so i strongly encourage others who are considering anything like this to do their own research as well my father has been so impressed with what he has seen from both myself and my son we are all very close that i have had the fortunate experience of being surrounded by my own personal research team therefore , based on my own experience , i feel really confident with my personal dosages , method of coming off of anti depressants , and giving the supplement to my son i am not telling anyone to do the same without doing their own research , attempting to discuss this with their doctors , etc etc i m sure i don t have to tell you that depression is an extremely serious disease , so please view this blog post as food for thought but not the official go to place for information be your own responsibility and look into it yourself that said , a couple of key points i would like to mention research shows that pretty much everyone can benefit in some way from taking folic acid however , those who are not able to absorb the folate genetically vs those who are will react differently and have very different experiences for those who can t absorb it , and who take the mthf , it will work drastically better than those who can absorb it naturally and whose depression is not biologically based but perhaps more psychologically or experience based instead as with any supplement or drug , amounts are key one person and these are random amounts i m naming might need mg a day , another , and yet another , i have been playing around with quantities danger ! yes ! i m not a doctor ! and it seems that i do best when i take twice as much as i initially thought based on my research i would need many physicians have no damn clue about this and it s really frustrating but hopefully through blogs and other word of mouth , more doctors will become interested and look into it but i have to admit i get really annoyed at people who say okay , i ll discuss it with my doctor and then the doctor has never heard of it and the idea is dismissed i am not pushing the mthf here so much as i am encouraging people to be their own health advocates after i looked into and actually read the pages of disclaimers of cymbalta , i was shocked that the stuff is on the market and yet , doctors wanted to keep me on it traditional blood tests might not show that you do not absorb the folic acid it might show up , yes , because it s in your system , but the indicators will not be there whether it is actually being fully absorbed and processed correctly or not so you can t really see whether you can or can not genetically absorb the folic acid by saying oh , i had my blood panel done and my folate levels were fine it goes deeper than that , folks you 'll need the actual genetic testing not all folic acids are the same chances are , you will not be able to find the proper l methylfolate in your local healthfood store the l is the important bit here , which is the folate in it s purest form yes , taking folic acid is good but there is a good , better , and best and it turns out , for the extreme cases , ie , the people who don t absorb it , that the l is the way to go there is an entirely different discussion to be had which i don t really understand that has to do with folic acid and the b vitamins turns out that it is highly recommended that you take a b with the folic acid i found a methylated one that both myself , my husband , my mother in law , and my best friend now take because it is awesome and the energy you get from it is amazing just thought i d throw that in there the drug deplin is a prescription of methyl folate and comes in mg and mg pill form i am mentioning it because it comes up a lot when researching mthf i am honestly on the fence about it and can t entirely trust that it just is what it says it is or whether it has some of the synthetic neuro transmitters in there that the other antidepressants have , which , of course , is what i m trying to avoid there seems to be different information on it all over the place so it s left me stumped which means i won t take it i m sure it s fine and completely legit but i after coming off of the cymbalta i am so wary of anything prescription anymore i know this has gotten pretty long so i need to wrap it up , but i want to everyone to know that right now you re reading something from someone who has had a pretty rough time i ve had the world tell me that there is no reason for my depression , that i have everything to live for , blah blah blah yes , this is true , but there is this little thing called clinical depression that is very real and still exists no matter how smart you are , or pretty you are , or tall or short or thin or if you have a loving family or not , a supportive spouse or dog or whatever it s like cancer it can get anyone to say that i am thrilled to find mthf is an understatement wonderdrug ? probably not nothing comes without work you ll have to stay on it , to find the dose that works for you , and also be willing to examine your life and make whatever changes that are necessary in order to help yourself no pill will do that , but it might motivate you to i can t pretend that i know everything about folic acid , and my life isn t or even or percent rainbows and butterflies since i ve started taking it , but to me , it is an incredibly huge step and i am so grateful to ray for this blog , and to melanie from methodical musings of an unbalanced woman , for introducing me to this supplement and also being my depression support group , in a way my life and my son s has taken its most drastic change to date and it s really exciting for me i actually feel like , for the first time ever , that life might be worth living after all go figure in my own blog , from manic to mindful , i write about my experiences with depression , with coming off of antidepressants and how i did it and my struggles with it , and all of the proactive steps i m taking to rid myself of depression without the aid of the medical community some of it is helpful , i m sure , but admittedly , some days i just b tch about how i hate costco milk containers and how i get so angry at them that i want to throw them across the kitchen after all , i might take mthf now and meditate daily , but that doesn t mean i m not human
