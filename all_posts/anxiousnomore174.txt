a today is a panic day and i usually throw up on a day like today i should be cautious so that i don t panic if i do panic than that means i am back where i was a year ago and i haven t learned anything then the worrier comes in what if i start out ok but then they go to get food or the panic comes on very quickly like it did last time ? what if i get sick ? now i will address these worries if the worse case scenario came true and i had a panic attack today , i would be just fine i don t have to be all better today just because i want to be i can take as small a step forward as i choose i can t force the growth if i did panic , no one would think badly of me , not even myself if i decided that i wouldn t go shooting with my coworkers after all , then that s ok because it s my birthday and i should do what i want on my birthday if i get sick today than so what ! if they pass judgment on me what s the worst that could happen ? people are going to not like me or think ill of me no matter how perfect i might try to be so i should stop trying to please them and do what i want , because i m the one that has to be happy or miserable if they want to go shooting and i decide not to go , i could tell them , you know , i changed my mind , i am not feeling well and i have a lot of work to do i better stay back , but you can go or i could say do you mind if we go after you guys eat lunch ? i am not feeling well and i would rather go when i don t have the smells in the way and it might sound awkward but what s the worst that could happen ? they could again pass judgment on me but i have to learn that it s their problem if they think ill of me , not mine and that i am being me which is the most important thing ! if i feel sick and i don t want to eat , than don t eat my body will tell me when it is hungry and there is no need to push myself if i am feeling anxious and i don t want to go than don t go positive affirmation there is no need to push myself i don t have to be all better today a lightbulb just went off for me as i wrote this post today isn t about pushing myself to prove that i can face my fears and not panic , proving to myself that i am somehow cured it s about creating a birthday that is happy and anxious free so that next year i can reflect back on how it s possible to have a good birthday then maybe i won t be so scared of them if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety or add it to your technorati favorites you might also like level panic today theres no need to push myself are we talking ourselves into panicking ?
