clink and i are talking at at maryland 's th annual suicide prevention conference next week when we were asked , we told them that suicide was not an area of specialty for either of us , and that we usually speak about the public face of psychiatry and ways that blogs , podcasts , twitter , facebook , and good old fashion books like shrink rap can help people understand what it is that psychiatry is all about they told us that was fine still , we 'd like our workshop to be relevant to the overall topic at hand , so i thought i would ask you to share your experiences with us if you 've been suicidal , what helped get you through ? did a mental health care professional say or do anything that was helpful ? did hospitalization help ? did medicine help ? if you had a serious attempt , do you think there was anything someone could have said or done to have prevented your attempt ? what keeps you from acting on suicidal impulses ? what has pushed you towards acting on them ? as always , thank you for your help we continue to learn a lot from our readers !
