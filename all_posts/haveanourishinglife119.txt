i am now the most miserable man living if what i feel were equally distributed to the whole human family , there would not be one cheerful face on earth abraham lincoln lots of people struggle with , or have struggled with , depression in the past even really famous people , even people you would have never thought , and even people who have gone on to achieve amazing feats have struggled with a mental illness for example , abraham lincoln , jim carrey , fyodor dostoyevsky , and winston churchill are all know to have struggled with depression click here for a full list from wikipedia no one likes to talk about depression no one likes to admit that they are taking an anti depressant and i ve never met a person who was not deathly afraid to even begin taking a pill such as an anti depressant so , we don t know the reality of the extent of this disease in our world today but , my guess is many people suffer with depression still , despite the widespread epidemic , depression has a social stigma it s a mental illness when people think mental illness they think about hospitals , the white van , strait jackets , and ruined lives it is true , and very sad , that many have suffered severe mental illness that merits them all the horrors listed above some mental illnesses are life long , and some are terminal we have not yet found a cure for mental illnesses like , schizophrenia and extreme bi polar disorder living with these illnesses takes constant vigilance , maintenance with medication , and medical monitoring for the patient to have a seemingly normal life it breaks my heart but depression is not one of those mental illnesses depression can be temporary if treated correctly , you can be cured of your depression it s like comparing the flu with hiv they are both viruses , right ? they both cause pain and suffering however , you are more likely to recover from the flu then from hiv hiv has no known cure yet depression has a cure comparatively , you are more likely to recover from depression than schizophrenia i am not trying to devalue the pain of depression i almost did not survive it myself depression is terrible the worst part was that i felt like i deserved it i deserved to suffer from depression a few years ago , i didn t think i had any reason to get help for the anxiety , despair , and worthlessness i felt on a daily basis this response is pretty common among depression patients i didn t feel like i deserved to be happy and , i couldn t go to the doctor because , what would i say ? it is easier to pinpoint on your body what hurts to a doctor but , with depression , it was just an overall sense of i still don t know how to describe how it feels with just one word i couldn t describe my depression or anxiety to anyone else close to me , let alone a stranger or a doctor so , because of these two reasons , i put off seeking help for my problems what does depression feel like ? depression and anxiety two sides of the same coin kind of feels like you re walking down a long , dark , never ending , descending corridor , there s no sunlight , no way back , and no way out you have pounds of pressure on your shoulders pushing you in the opposite direction and weighing you down constantly it is too difficult to get out of bed in the morning because you know what you have to face nothing eases your pain you used to cry multiple times a day but now you just feel numb to everything and have stopped caring you might have occasional bursts of energy but they are always accompanied by a lower low than before the high so you are either spending each moment searching for that next thing that will give you a high , or you are scared to feel anything at all because of what you might do i e harm yourself it s terrible i didn t know that this condition wasn t normal and i didn t know that i didn t have to live with it guess what ? if you struggle with anxiety or depression or both , you don t have to live with it either making the first step toward getting help is the most difficult but it is the most important step as long as you never stop seeking help , you will make it know that there is help available and there is hope depression is not a terminal illness it can be if you don t get the right kind of help it would be like dying from the flu tragic because treatment is so common and widely accessible if depression had no termination , then suicide would , indeed , be the only remedy but one need not sound the false or inspirational note to stress the truth that depression is not the soul s annihilation men and women who have recovered from the disease and they are countless bear witness to what is probably its only saving grace it is conquerable by william styron , darkness visible i 've quoted that paragraph before you can find it here how do you know if you have depression ?
