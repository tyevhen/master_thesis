at the end of the horrible day as described in the previous blog , i called my parents they took my depression more seriously than i did no , no , i'm fine it 's just a flesh wound i'm getting better and booked me a ticket home for that very night using frequent flier miles i threw the contents of my lit review and a couple t shirts in my suitcase and raced to the airport it was an exhilarating drive , and i had a calm , end of the world feeling as the plane took off , i watched the city that has become my jail shrink into black night i ignored the under knowledge that it was a false escape and concentrated on the airplane magazine finding that inane , i turned to one of the library books i'm rereading in order to complete my thesis corrections even though i was taking my problems with me as literal carry on baggage , it felt good to be going home my real home , not my shared rental house in a college town note i'm on a roll with another example of banksy 's genius this does n't mean i'm suicidal but it is a butchered movie quote can you tell which one ?
