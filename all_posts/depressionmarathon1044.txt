the good news is my mouth , with it 's new vacancy , hurts so much that i ca n't possibly focus on depression ! ouch ! i was n't planning on having a tooth pulled when i saw my dentist yesterday it was supposed to be time for a crown unfortunately , i fractured the tooth during lunch on wednesday it was a wild , freaky , concrete piece of granola which lept out of my yogurt and doomed the tooth as soon as i clamped down , i heard and felt an unnerving crack ! damn granola ! beware of unusually crunchy , stealth granola , readers !
