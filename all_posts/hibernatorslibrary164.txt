the three sisters the krampus chronicles book , by sonia halbach this book was provided by the publisher through netgalley in exchange for a fair and honest review every christmas eve , maggie has the same dream santa is walking on the top of her grandfather 's manor , when suddenly he slides off the end but this year is different this year , it 's a nightmare in which he is pushed by something sinister awakened from her dream , she decides to go sledding ending up in an accident that leads to meeting the handsome but older henry henry has come with strange claims that maggie 's grandfather , who is well known for writing the poem 'twas the night before christmas , had plagiarized his poem while exploring the mansion for proof of plagiarism , henry and maggie are accidentally swept into a strange underground village named poppel a village strangely resembling santa 's fabled home but not all is right in poppel it is ruled by tyrants called the garrison , and nikolaos is missing she and henry must find three hidden objects before the end of christmas eve , or else maggie , henry and their families are in terrible danger as is the hidden village of poppel this was a refreshingly unique story based on the poem 'twas the night before christmas and alpine german folklore of the anti santa named krampus who knew a world could be built just around such a short poem ? and i 'd never heard of krampus before reading this book of course , just yesterday i went to the theaters and found out that a movie named krampus is soon to be released , though there seems to be no relation between the two i really enjoyed reading this book it was cute , adventurous , and had a tad of romantic tension and one thing i really loved about this book is that the story was complete at the end that is the perfect beginning to a series , as far as i'm concerned i will definitely watch for the next in the series snowflakes for creativity , action , romance , and fun
