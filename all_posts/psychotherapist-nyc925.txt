the coming out process as a gay , lesbian or bisexual person is a very individual process there is no one right way or particular age to come out for many people , it 's a challenging process that can take years and for others it 's an exhilarating process that frees them to be who they are naturally without having to pretend to be heterosexual coming out as a gay man some people say that they knew that they were gay from the time they were children or teens many others say that they dated the opposite sex for a while , had satisfying romantic relationships as mature adults , and even got married and had children before they realized that they were gay , lesbian or bisexual there seems to be a misperception that most gay , lesbian and bisexual people come out in their teens while this is true for some people , it does n't appear to be the case for the vast majority another misperception is that once a person comes out , it 's a linear process that ends with that initial coming out but , in reality , for most people , the coming out process is a life long process that changes over time as they accept their own identity , come out to friends and family , meet new people , start new jobs , and encounter new situations for most gay or bisexual people , new people who meet them will assume that they 're heterosexual so , each time it 's a matter of choosing whether or not to come out with new people and in new situations this is very different from being heterosexual where you do n't have to think about this or explain your sexual orientation the other possibility is that a person might come out and then go back and forth , in and out of the closet a few times before acknowledging or not his or her sexual orientation coming out as a lesbian usually , the coming out process starts with coming out to yourself if you 're fortunate enough to know other lesbian , gay or bisexual people or if you live in a large city where there are resources , you can usually find supportive people to talk to that wo n't have a negative reaction i 've listed some resources below for people in the nyc area as well as a national hotline , if you live in other areas i coming out as bisexual if you do n't know anyone and you live in an area where there are either limited or no resources , it might be a matter of calling an lgbt lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender hotline to talk it 's important to know that you 're not alone there are many other people who have gone through this same process and are continuing to go through this process and it 's important not to isolate finding support and places to socialize in your area can be affirming to your identity and emotional well being the next challenge is usually coming out to family and friends it 's easier to come out to supportive family and friends first before considering coming out to others who might not be as supportive of course , this is always a judgement call and you might be surprised , for better or worse , how people react it 's important to realize , too , that if coming out is a process for you , it might also be a process for your family and friends to see you in a new way they might need time to understand what this means to you and to your relationship with them coming out on the job can present a particular challenge for many people even if you live in a city like new york , where there are laws against discrimination based on sexual orientation , it does n't mean that you wo n't be discriminated against , sometimes in subtle ways , or that your employer will feel comfortable with your sexual orientation your employer should only be taking into consideration your work performance , but the law does n't control people 's personal likes or dislikes and actually proving discrimination , of any kind , can be difficult if you 're in a relationship , there 's the question of how to talk about your partner or how comfortable you feel inviting your partner to company events again , this is another choice and what you decide can have repercussions for your relationship some people have the attitude that they 're out to everyone and they feel this makes their life easier because they do n't want to have to think about it all the time in each situation as previously mentioned , other people choose when and where to be out coming out is a complex issue and one post cannot possibly cover all the topics involved i 've touched on some of the main coming out issues if you need further assistance , please see the resource list that i 've provided towards the end of this post if you 're gay or bisexual and you 're thinking about seeing a psychotherapist , whether it 's specifically for coming out issues or not , it 's important to find a therapist who is gay affirmative and has experience working with gay , lesbian and bisexual clients if you 're not sure , you can ask you do n't want to see a therapist who has an agenda to change your sexual orientation or who views being gay or bisexual as a disorder even though the american psychological association removed homosexuality from their list of mental health disorders more than years ago , there are still a minority of therapists who either do n't understand or , for their own reasons , continue to see homosexuality as a psychological disorder some people want to know if their psychotherapist is gay or bisexual and others do n't want to know anything about their therapists usually , therapists do n't divulge a lot about themselves because the therapy is supposed to be focused on you and not them , but if it 's important for you to have a therapist that you know is either gay or bisexual , ask prospective therapists that you meet for consultations hopefully , your coming out process will be a happy and meaningful experience but if you need help , do n't be afraid to ask the following is a resource list primarily for gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered individuals as well as a
