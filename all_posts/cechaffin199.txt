i was musing on the porch tonight when i thought of what it must be like to create a theory of the mind without modern discoveries , as freud and jung did and my thoughts took this shape thought as soon as you say the word in your mind , thought has begun but what generates thought ? and how is thought integrated with emotion and memory , and how does it generate future projection or re imagining past events ? first , in my most parsimonious construction , consider five parts of the mind thought verbal and non verbal , emotion expressed or contained , emotional memory , intellectual memory , and the synthesizer you can make a mandala of this emotional memory emotion synthesizer thought intellectual memory where does thought come from ? a variety of stimuli can spark thought , but when thought appears in its most easily translatable form , it appears in words you look at a tree and think tree after the image of the tree is recognized by memory , there follows a distinctly human urge to name it , to mark it with a word as if marking intellectual territory , the constant , silent narration of the mind 's word generator one can have thought without words , but only when the mind comments in words does recordable thought really begin , unless we resort to gestures and pictures here the role of emotion can be causative or reactive a bad feeling can trigger a bad thought as easily as a bad thought can trigger a bad feeling more often than we suspect , emotion precedes thought , especially in extreme emotional states where we get angry with everyone and everything in consciousness , however , thought prefers to think that it dominates as the initiator , when often it is only the verbal midwife for emotion there is also a body quotient for emotion how much physical expression will we yield to emotion and in what environment ? will we laugh at a bad joke to make our boss feel better ? will we make a disgusted face when someone farts although we really think it 's funny ? this is complex but belongs to the emotions , which are much more firmly welded to the body than thought memory functions both intellectually and emotionally emotions can ignite memories that recall those emotions , and intellectual memories images and words and sounds and other storage methods can recall emotions , which can provoke other memories , and so on clearly there is an interplay between intellectual and emotional memories , and clearly both can be incarnated into words , or conscious thought , by another part of the mind , its central hub , so to speak , the synthesizer , of which the i is only one voice thought is , in fact , in so far at it is verbal or symbolic , as in mathematics , rather divorced from the body but thought can also be automatic every day i wake up with a different song playing in my head today it was peter , paul , and mary with i dig rock and roll music many other automatic thoughts occur , like birds flying through our heads what is particularly impressive is the power of the synthesizer to take intellectual and emotional memories and imagine the future , as i did when i visualized approaching my desk to write this down while staring at the ocean i do n't know if i ever translated it into thought i did n't say , i will go write this down i actually visualized the future in a non verbal way , imagining the visual path to my desk and computer we construct our futures piece by piece through the imagination of the synthesizer , the ability to take present data and push it forward in time to imagine an action we take this foresight for granted , when indeed it is not reality but the synthesizer imagining it what or who is the synthesizer ? any attempt at explanation would be oversimplification it contains the will , desire , prejudice , stock reactions , measured reactions , associative bird walks , everything except thought the reification or output of the synthesizer in words or other defined symbols though thought can include spatial images just as easily , as non verbal thought is possible , yet inevitably the synthesizer will initiate verbal thought at some point wow ! that 's an awesome equation you just thought up ! or , what a boat that would be ! but could i afford it ? so to confine thought to words is premature still , when words appear , they take on an entirely different quality , somehow outside the synthesizer they take on an objective quality , why i equate thought in my system with verbal assignment , and with visualization and other forms of thought to a lesser degree , as visualization is more dependent on drawing from intellectual memory if this model is a useful , i should be able to use it to describe my actions first i felt anxiety about risking this description then a thrill about the attempt occurred now i am eager to go outside and smoke a cigarette and re process my thoughts in doing so i imagine the white wooden porch , the chair i will sit in , the porch light , the path through the living room , all without thinking here i go , i verbalized when i noticed the pain in my lumbosacral spine protest about rising from this chair then i wondered whether to go on writing about the ache in my back , the slightly uncomfortable rub of the desk against my forearms , the ache in my feet and other bodily sensations these sensations sparked no emotions , however , they were simply flat inputs from the body , perhaps necessitating an intellectual body sense as well , a body monitoring so the monitoring of the body is another intellectual function of the intellect in looking for an analogy in nature for the human mind , everything i can imagine falls short if a computer had emotions , self consciousness , body consciousness and functional movement , along with the ability to relate to other computers so gifted , it might approach the human mind , save for the role of the will would enough memory and processing power ever be able to summon self consciousness and initiative ? at this point it is doubtful but i digress to be continued ce
