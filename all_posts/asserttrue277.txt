once a genome has been sequenced , identification of coding regions of dna and assingment of functions to those regions is almost always done by software the glimmer gene locator and interpolated markov modeler freeware package , available from johns hopkins university , is a widely used annotation system it finds putative genes , identifies which strand they 're on , locates start and stop codons , etc the technology is suprisingly good glimmer reputedly finds of genes but it also has serious limitations programs like glimmer have a relatively easy time locating open reading frames in low gc low guanine , cytosine genomes but have a more difficult time identifying the sense strand in high gc genomes also , gene size matters glimmer is great at finding sizable genes but is less accurate with small genes these shortcomings are not unique to glimmer but apply to all gene detection software that i'm aware of in almost every bacterial genome , to of genes cannot be identified as to function and are tagged hypothetical protein these genes tend to differ from other genes in various ways size , for example gene size distribution for n genes of assigned function blue and n hypothetical protein genes red in e coli b the above graph shows the size distribution of protein coding genes in e coli b hypothetical protein genes n are shown in red genes with an assigned function n are in blue you can see that at gene sizes below base pairs , genes tend more often than not to be labeled hypothetical protein in e coli , hypothetical protein genes also tend to have lower gc content in the third codon base the so called wobble base whereas gc has a median value of in genes with assigned functions , gc has a median value of in hypothetical proteins in most genes , codons tend to begin with a purine base a or g of the time in e coli , it 's of the time genes in which ag is less than are rare in e coli , only of function assigned genes have ag under , but of hypothetical protein genes have ag under , and hypotheticals are three times as likely to have ag purine content , codon base one less than ag purine content , base two the latter is an important sanity check of reading frame one would only expect ag to be less than ag in genes with a frameshift error or incorrect reading frame assignment if of hypothetical protein genes in e coli are in the wrong reading reading frame , that 's over genes hypothetical genes comprise of e coli 's cds genes when i made a cursory spot check of hypothetical protein genes in e coli b , i quickly found a number of genes ecb , ecb , ecb , ecb , ecb , and others that were incorrectly designated as to the sense versus antisense strand these genes produced more and better blast hits when reverse translated than when forward translated some of them had stop codons in the middle , but that 's okay that just means they 're pseudogenes it 's vitally important to correctly identify pseudogenes in most bacterial genomes , pseudogenes are vastly underreported , because they 're hard to distinguish from non coding regions bottom line , there 's ample reason to believe a substantial fraction of the hypothetical protein genes in e coli are in fact either in the wrong reading frame , are pseudogenes , or have an improperly located start codon or harbor other serious errors i do n't think e coli is exceptional i'm convinced misannotation is a serious issue affecting or more of all machine annotated genes some annotation programs do a better job than others of hiding problems like overlap resolution and small gene detection , but the problems are there , bigtime , and are n't likely to go away any time soon
