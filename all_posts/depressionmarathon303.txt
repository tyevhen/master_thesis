i thought summer would never arrive , and i'm welcoming the warm weather and sunshine with open arms i ran miles in the middle of the day today and just soaked it all in i was sweating up a storm but enjoyed every minute i spent this past weekend with d he came to visit from milwaukee we ran together , spent a day with my brother , had a nice dinner out , and had brunch with my best friend , wendy d has n't met any of my brothers , so it was nice for him to meet at least one of them they seemed to enjoy each other we spent the day walking around , eating , and shopping in my brother 's historic small town the weather was gorgeous my brother was funny , as usual and we had a really fine day wendy also had not met d she 's been teasing me , saying he 's just a figment of my imagination well they finally got to meet when we had brunch together on sunday we had a great time and laughed a lot wendy gave d her seal of approval afterward it 's always good when your friends like your boyfriend it was a very nice weekend d left sunday afternoon , and as usual i was exhausted i think i slept for two hours after he left i love when he 's here , but i always feel tired after he 's gone i think it 's just the result of being out of my routine i'm busier than when i'm alone on the weekends , and i do n't get to nap i do n't think i 've yet recovered from the weekend because my parents arrived yesterday right after work they spent the night and left this morning so again , no nap yesterday i worked hours , went for my run , and then spent the evening with my parents they helped me pick out a new lawn mower , and we went out to eat by the time we got home , put the lawn mower together and tested it out , it was time for bed thankfully , i did n't work today i napped after my parents left , ran , and mowed my lawn i got back into my routine , but i am still tired ! i 'll be back at work for another hours tomorrow it 's frustrating to be so tired i feel like i should be able to handle the slight uptick in activity without so much fatigue , but apparently i ca n't and i guess there is no use to be frustrated by it it is what it is i 'll hopefully sleep well tonight and catch up i'm looking forward to that
