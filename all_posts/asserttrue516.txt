the flip side of capitalism i keep a five dollar bill on me at all times compassion comes in smaller denominations and larger ones , to be sure but i ca n't , in good conscience , carry less spare change on me than let me tell you what typically happens to the five dollars i was walking down the street not long ago in a small shopping district two miles from my house , on the way from the health food store to starbucks , when i passed a young black woman sitting on the sidewalk the woman was wearing tattered jeans and grey tennis shoes without laces , and a hooded sweatshirt that only accentuated her gauntness her face was thin , cheeks slightly sunken it was the face of an old woman and a child at the same time as i slowed to look at the woman , i could see that she was rocking forward and back , forward and back , like an autistic child while rocking , the young woman looked up at me and muttered something in a voice so soft and frail that i could n't be sure what she was saying as i leaned closer to hear her , she said can you spare some change ? in america , it 's customary for passersby treat such people as invisible they are the untouchables of american culture americans think of the old now largely defunct indian caste system as embarrassingly barbaric and foreign , but the truth is , in the united states we have a caste system of our own , with untouchables at the bottom , just like in the british ruled india of old , except that our dalits , our panchamas , our asprushya , go by names of homeless and street people americans do n't like to see the stark , inescapable , physical evidence of capitalism 's failure , as represented by street people , because it calls into question our most fundamental beliefs about america being a land of plenty , a land of unequaled opportunity , where hard work is always rewarded , and where by a curious kind of inverse logic people who sit on street corners asking for money must , by that very fact , be guilty of not working hard enough the american dream dictates that you are the agent of your own destiny if you end up on the street , it is your fault it is considered inappropriate , in america , for ordinary people to give money to the undeserving the comic louis c k has a comedy routine built around the inappropriateness of giving money to street people louis describes the alarm that a cousin of his , who had never been to new york city , showed upon finding a disheveled homeless person sitting on the ground outside the port authority bus station at one point , the horrified cousin leans down to say to the homeless person oh my god , sir , are you okay ? what happens ? what happens ? louis c k mockingly says what happens ? america happens what do you mean what happens ? when america happens , sometimes it 's not pretty americans , as a rule , staunchly deny the ugly side of american life , the fact that the american dream is actually an american nightmare for large numbers of people they would prefer to wish away the existence of the , or so people who are homeless on any given day in the united states americans have all kinds of lame , self righteous excuses for not giving money to someone in obvious need of help he 'll only use the money for drugs or alcohol is one such excuse another popular sentiment is that person needs to get a job , or that person simply does n't want to help himself as if the disadvantaged choose their lot out of laziness as if anyone chooses to starve to death or freeze to death on the streets of the richest country on earth yet another popular excuse is if i give money to everybody who asks for it , i 'll go broke that one really gets me there 's an old story you 've probably heard it many times about a young boy who , after a storm , finds thousands of still alilve but soon to be dead starfish washed up on a beach the boy starts throwing starfish into the water one by one an old man happens by witnessing the boy 's futile effort to save all the starfish , he says why are you doing that ? the boy answers because if i do n't , these starfish will die the old man laughs and says but there are thousands and thousands of starfish here do n't you understand that what you 're doing ca n't possibly make a difference ? upon hearing this , the boy bends down , picks up a starfish , and hurls it into the sea he looks at the old man and says i made a huge difference to that one are some homeless people just lazy substance abusers looking for money to buy their next fix ? some are , certainly one u s government agency estimates that of homeless people are dependent on alcohol but why did these people become dependent on alcohol ? how many of them abuse alcohol because they 're homeless ? will homeless alcoholics not be homeless if they stop using alcohol ? a common sight in any major city in america many studies have been done , not only in the u s but in other countries , of the rate of serious mental illness among the homeless according to stony brook medicine , to of homeless americans have schizophrenia the national coalition for the homeless puts that figure at to and lumps schizophrenia together with other severe mental illness but does the actual figure really matter ? it 's clear , even to an untrained observer , that a sizable percentage of street people are mentally ill the young woman i saw on the street that day did n't smell of alcohol she was n't exactly a raving lunatic , either , although i do wonder why she was rocking back and forth constantly it was n't cold out she clearly was n't doing it to keep warm here 's the bottom line the criterion i go by when someone asks me for money is very simple i ask myself does this person look like he or she needs the five dollars more than i do ? if the answer is yes , as it invariably is , i do n't lie and say i have n't got any spare change i do n't avert my eyes like a coward i do n't ask the person how he or she will spend the money i just give the person five dollars do i feel good about doing that ? yes and no i feel good knowing that i may have helped someone obtain a meal or whatever it is they might have needed to get through another day i feel bad knowing that what i just gave the person in no way cured his or her situation i only know one thing for sure if i do n't give the person the five dollars ? i feel like the old man in the starfish story i 'd much rather feel like the boy
