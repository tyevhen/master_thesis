in a bloomberg report , it was noted that johnson johnson cut costs as it faces generic competition to its best selling prescription drug , the antipsychotic risperdal , which generated billion last year phew , it 's a good thing that invega son of risperdal is on the market to save the day for j j and there is some preliminary read probably bogus research suggesting that it works better than seroquel in treating schizophrenia see my recent post to understand my skepticism regarding the latest results invega is entering a crowded market abilify , seroquel , zyprexa , generic risperidone , geodon , etc and i do n't think it is going to fare particularly well unless there is some pretty darned impressive marketing which is not entirely out of the question i humbly suggest taking a piece from pfizer 's geodon campaign
