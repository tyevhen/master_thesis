is it possible that today 's high lung cancer rates are in large part due to the power of suggestion ? might the presence of surgeon general warnings on a pack of cigarets actually cause people to expect to get cancer , and then see their expectation fulfilled ? will stronger warnings with ugly pictures only make the problem worse ? one of the new fda approved warning labels this idea that telling smokers they 'll get cancer increases their odds of getting cancer may sound ridiculous nevertheless , the epidemiological data tell an interesting tale interesting to the point of being spooky placebos and nocebos i 'll need to take a moment to explain how this idea came about bear with me if you can i recently happened to stumble onto michael specter 's december , new yorker article about placebo effect research i told my girlfriend sally about the article it sparked an animated discussion about the power of suggestion we agreed that the power of suggestion is real any doctor knows this to be true and it works both ways negative suggestion can produce negative effects , just as positive suggestion can produce positive effects this has been verified in placebo research nocebos negative placebos have been found to produce harm , just as conventional placebos have been found to produce positive results sally and i began to speculate on the role of suggestion in the evolution of epidemic scale disease i offered the not very original idea that the runaway increase in the prevalence of bipolar illness over the past sixty years might be explained , at least in part , by the power of suggestion ever since the introduction of prozac in , all of us in the u s , at least have been bombarded with pharma ads and popular media articles telling us that depression is extremely common and surprise , surprise now it is ! but it did n't used to be in , only , people in the u s , were in mental hospitals as a result of disablement due to depression c silverman , , the epidemiology of depression , johns hopkins press today , depression is the leading cause of disability in the u s for people aged according to nimh stats depression now affects million american adults million in the form of major depressive disorder and million in the form of bipolar disorder that 's a pretty huge jump in numbers , to million were there millions of depressed people in hiding , in , waiting to come out of the closet in the s ? was of the american adult population the percentage now suffering depression merely suffering in silence , back in ? or did the drug companies and their media flacks convert a relatively rare psychological condition into a growth industry through massive advertising and media hype in other words , through the power of suggestion ? a weird suggestion sally and i began to speculate about the possible role of the power of suggestion in other epidemic diseases somatic diseases not just mental illness sally offered an interesting hypothesis involving lung cancer what if today 's high rate of lung cancer among smokers is due in part to the suggestion planted in every smoker 's mind that smoking will lead inevitably to lung cancer ? i balked at the idea that ca n't be true , i said if it were true , today 's lung cancer rates should be much higher than can be accounted for by smoking , compared to years past also , we should find that lung cancer rates took off after the announcement of the surgeon general 's report on smoking and we should see that lung cancer rates have decoupled from smoking rates entirely , going up when smoking goes down it turns out all of those predictions are met click to enlarge in , the lung cancer death rate for men was per , by , the rate had increased to per , a fold increase we find a similar trend for women in , the lung cancer death rate for women was per , by , it was just over per , again , a fold increase and yet , per capita cigaret consumption rose only by a factor of two in the same time period the most recent statistics as reported by the national cancer institute put the lung cancer rate for u s men at per year per , men for women , it 's per , so for men , the rate since has leveled off and drifted lower for women , the rate has continued to soar the above illustration shows these data graphically source www publichealth pitt edu docs perkins ppt we see that the slope of the lung cancer rate curve was more or less constant from to then the slope increases dramatically in at the time of the first u s surgeon general 's report on lung cancer and cigaret smoking following the surgeon general 's report , cigaret consumption starts to decline the rate of cancer , however , continues to skyrocket , even after the especially sharp downturn in cigaret smoking that begins in the early s a time delay effect ? of course , it takes years of smoking to get lung cancer so you might expect the high cancer rate to reflect the high cigaret consumption rate but the numbers are still out of whack cigaret smoking doubled in the years leading up to lung cancer , on the other hand , tripled in the years leading up to one could explain this as some kind of dose response relationship in which cancer rates just naturally happen to increase at times the rate of increase of cigaret dose but according to the scientific literature , that is n't true at all a large danish study found that a increase in cigaret consumption going from sticks a day to causes lung cancer rates to increase by only a saturation effect has been noted many times in the literature after a certain number of cigarets per day , cancer rate no longer increases linearly with cigaret dose there 's another possible explanation for the recent runaway increase in lung cancer perhaps people in simply did n't live long enough to come down with lung cancer and there 's some truth to that the life expectancy in the u s in was only years for men and for women in it was for men and for women statistics show that the odds of lung cancer go up by a factor of between age and age but this falls far short of explaining the fold increase in lung cancer from to so we 're left with a dilemma either cigaret smoking is mysteriously becoming deadlier much deadlier , or something other than smoke is contributing to the runaway lung cancer rate in smokers what we know from the latest research this mystery was the subject of a paper by david m burns and colleagues , titled has the lung cancer risk from smoking increased over the last fifty years ? , in cancer causes control , march the authors of the paper note that u s lung cancer mortality rates are now substantially higher than those expected from changes in smoking behaviors in their analysis of epidemiological data , burns et al used a risk model that took into account , among other things , rates of smoking initiation prevalence of current and former smoking distributions of duration of smoking duration of abstinence and number of cigarettes smoked per day for current and former smokers and the duration of abstinence for former smokers it was a fairly detailed model , in other words what did they find ? the burns paper concluded , first of all , that the apparent rise in lung cancer risk for smoking is real , not an artifact of some kind the authors cite not only their own work but work by others swartz used birth cohort specific smoking prevalence data and a multi stage carcinogenesis model similar to that developed by whittemore to predict overall age adjusted trends in lung cancer mortality for white males from to he estimated that there should have been a decline in rates over the interval based on the assumption of a constant effect over time in the risk model this estimated decline contrasts sharply with the increase in the observed lung cancer mortality rates over that interval tolley and colleagues used an updated set of birth cohort smoking prevalence estimates , and a risk model developed by peto , to predict lung cancer death rates over time by birth cohort they estimated that overall lung cancer mortality should have begun to decline in the early s for white males and in the mid s for white females observed lung cancer mortality continued to rise throughout the s peaking in the early s for white males and may have only recently peaked for white females a similar approach using risk models developed from the cps i data and birth cohort specific smoking prevalence data from the national health interview survey nhis demonstrated a systematic trend of increasing underestimation of observed lung cancer mortality rates across all birth cohorts with advancing calendar year secondly when burns et al tried to adjust their model 's smoking duration assumptions to account for the epidemiological data , they failed to get a good fit with the data they fiddled with duration parameters rather than cigarets per day parameters because the contribution of cigarettes smoked per day to lung cancer risk is much smaller than the contribution of duration as the authors put it adjustments of the duration effect in the cps i risk equations do not provide reasonable estimates of the u s lung cancer mortality experience elsewhere they restate it this way adjustments for healthy population effects and for potential underestimates of the contribution of duration to risk are not able to eliminate either the differences in estimation accuracy across birth cohorts or the progressive underestimate of observed lung cancer mortality as calendar year advances by healthy population effects , they mean effects due to overall increasing health in the u s population over the past years better baseline health might make cancer rates appear worse depending how they 're expressed this graph shows that increased lung cancer rates do n't match the predictions of existing models taken from http www cbsnews com htdocs pdf srntposter pdf desperate to explain their results , burns et al end up suggesting that unspecified changes in cigaret design , occurring over a period of or more years , are to blame for the otherwise inexplicable increase in lung cancer rates but they fail to cite evidence connecting any particular design change with a worsening of cigaret toxicity their sole evidence for the supposed greater toxicity of modern day cigarets comes simply from the fact that fudging their model 's toxicity assumptions gives a perfect fit with the data we support that hypothesis by showing that even a simple adjustment of the cps i risk equations for an increase in risk due to changes in cigarettes adequately predicts the observed mortality data this is , of course , tantamount to saying that if you change your risk model to assume a more dangerous cigaret design , it supports the idea that cigarets are more dangerous it 's circular logic are cigarets really more toxic now ? so where does that leave us ? it leaves us with a mystery lung cancer rates have simply outraced any ability of smoking rates to explain them one possibility is that the burns group is actually right cigaret design features have made cigarets more dangerous but this is not supported by the literature quite the contrary , in fact the single largest and toxicologically most significant change in cigaret design of the last years was the addition of filters to cigarets prior to , over half of cigarets sold were non filtered sales of filtered cigarets skyrocketed following their introduction the difference in toxicity between filtered and non filtered cigarets , it turns out , is huge according to risks associated with smoking cigarettes with low machine measured yields of tar and nicotine national cancer institute smoking and tobacco control monograph a large u s case control study demonstrated significantly lower lung cancer odds ratios among filter cigarette smokers who had shifted to filtered cigarettes or more years prior to diagnosis kabat , as well as for lifetime filter use stellman et al , and two reports from a large multicountry case control study in europe also reported reductions in lung cancer risk associated with lifetime filtered cigarette use lubin et al , lubin , a b the magnitude of the effect is large almost see bross , i d , and gibson , r risks of lung cancer in smokers who switch to filter cigarettes american journal of public health and the nations health , the same national cancer institute monograph cites studies showing a significantly decreased not increased cancer risk with low tar cigarets ironically , the chapter of the monograph that discusses these results chapter was coauthored by david m burns , lead author of the increasing cancer risk study discussed above bottom line design changes have almost certainly made cigarets less toxic , not more toxic the literature around greater toxicity of light cigarets has centered on the recent shift of lung cancer cytology from squamous cell carcinoma to the more fatal adenocarcinoma but evidence connecting light cigarets to this shift has been notoriously indirect and anecdotal much more work is needed before a causal connection can definitively be said to exist between light cigarets and deadlier cancers other factors ? maybe other factors are at work in making cigaret smoking more hazardous but what could these other factors be ? bear in mind that because the rate of lung cancer in non smokers has not gone up , environmental factors affecting all populations equally smokers and non smokers cannot account for any increase in lung cancer rates among smokers in other words , if increased exposure to air borne carcinogens via urbanization to take one example could explain the increase in lung cancer over the past years a time when america did in fact become more urbanized , you 'd still be left trying to explain why lung cancer has n't gone up in non smokers the same can be said for arguments involving radon , asbestos , contaminants in drinking water , etc all of these would affect smokers and non smokers equally and yet lung cancer rates have not gone up for non smokers if we rule out changes in cigaret design and environmental factors as explanations for the enormous increase in lung cancer , what are we left with ? burns and others have put forth the absurdly desperate suggestion that today 's smokers draw more heavily and inhale more deeply on cigarets , pulling smaller smoke particles deeper into their lungs in other words , smokers are getting more cancer than ever before simply because they 're sucking harder making ourselves sick i'm starting to like sally 's hypothesis the power of suggestion , acting over a long period of time , may be predisposing smokers toward cancer every pack of cigarets sold in the u s contains increasingly grave sounding and grave looking warnings about the power of cigarets to cause cancer we 're bombarded with that message now smoking leads to cancer it inevitably leads to cancer you will get cancer get used to it for whatever reason , that has , in fact , become a self fulfilling prophecy
