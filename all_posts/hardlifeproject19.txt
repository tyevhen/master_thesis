i just got off the phone with ba we were going to go to a new year 's party , but we decided not to , which is frankly fine with me i'm fucking exhausted i 've have n't been sleeping for shit lately , and i just do n't feel up to dealing with a bunch of noise and drunks and loud music or with her , for that matter having to manage my feelings and manage my people pleasing tendencies and manage the awkwardness of our potential physical relationship and watching what i say and trying to be witty and trying to be funny and manage manage manage i think i'm really ok with just sitting this one out and ringing in the decade with my computer i love you , computer ! you 're always there for me will you marry me ? i got a massage yesterday i have a really good , young , female massage therapist and no , it 's not that kind of massage i do n't live in tijuana anyway , i had n't had one for awhile , and i noticed how much better i felt afterward how much more alive , more energy , and just an overall sense of physical wellbeing since i'm currently single , massage time is the only time i get any sort of extended physical contact with another human being oh sure , i get hugs at meetings and certainly i feel loved and cared about by my friends , but that deep , physical yearning never gets met the only creature i have significant touch with is my dog she likes to cuddle up on the couch and watch movies i'm glad i have her , because if i did n't , i would n't be getting any touch plus i do n't have to pay her having some physical intimacy with a woman made me realize how shut down i 've become i'm numbed out , living mostly in my head because trying to be in my body and cope with how i'm feeling is too hard until yesterday , i guess that strategy was working because i felt not a hell of a lot blank empty not in pain , just nothing it 's a weird feeling , especially for someone like me who 's used to always feeling so much i think i 'd rather be in pain than live in that blank , robot state that seems worse than pain for some reason there 's something creepy about it it 's like being dead i'm not numb today i'm feeling again it 's hard , but i think i like it better , even though it hurts mostly i feel exhausted i'm so tired of coping with all this fear , always being afraid and trying to keep up at work and make enough money and taking care of the dog cleaning , for god 's sake and taking basic care of myself diet , exercise , meetings , forcing myself to go be social it 's so hard to find any balance where is the energy supposed to come from ? i 've been overwhelmed for so long i 've just kind of accepted it as normal and it 's getting harder , because i'm getting weaker as i get older i feel more and more debilitated by it all and do n't know how to get adequate help coping how do single parents do it ? christ , i 'd be dead in a week ! i guess that regular physical contact really does improve your health that 's why the weird lesbian who lives on the top floor of your building has cats she would n't have the strength to keep going otherwise and the type of contact i crave lately is not sexual , which is also a very new and weird thing for me i shared at a meeting recently that pursuing women and romance and fantasy and sex was what got me out of bed in the morning for the last years and it 's true that 's what i lived for , for a long , long time sallymandy commented that her addictions loved her until they abandoned her that 's exactly what this feels like the longterm love affair with sex and love is over now what ? stay alive and try to find another way to live , or go numb ?
