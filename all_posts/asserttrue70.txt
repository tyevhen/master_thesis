i was saying just now to my good friend and former coworker at the real story group go visit them now please , i 'll wait here theresa regli follow her on twitter , please read her bio here that you know you 're a writer when you continue to compulsively tweet and blog even after you 're more than half blind and are n't getting paid theresa regli software analyst unsung hero which is no joke it 's true so what happened is , after being out of work for two years one year of which , i was care giving to my disabled wife , i began looking for a job my wife is in remission now , and that turned out to be quite an adventure more blog posts needed tbd and then , after a few opportunities fell through , i connected with an outfit in l a details later who saw me as a value add , if that 's the politically correct capitalist buzz terminology du jour they made it clear after a lot of hoop jumping they wanted to interview me in person but they did n't want to pay my way out for an interview so i said thanks , but i ca n't pay my way out take my name out of consideration three days went by then they stepped up and offered to pay my way out and i was interviewed by the c level top people at the company , and it all went swimmingly but at ont airport , on the way home from the interview on july , , i suffered a vitreous hemorrhage due to a completely unprovoked retinal tear when i say completely unprovoked , i mean , specifically i have no risk factors diabetes , hypertension , i was n't lifting weights or bending or getting my blood pressure up or taking drugs or doing anything out of the ordinary whatsoever , in fact i was merely talking to the ticket agent at the united counter on the morning of the united glitch , when suddenly my field of vision became a lava lamp of black goo james joyce suffered a variety of eye problems his whole life i write and revise and correct with one or two eyes about twelve hours a day , i should say , stopping for intervals of five minutes or so when i ca n't see any more i closed one eye , then the other my right eye was hosed as i speed walked to the gate to catch my flight barely making it , i realized my right eye was getting cloudier and cloudier , to the point where i could n't see the fingers on my hand i could see light areas and dark areas , and not much more but i still had one good eye my bad eye for which i was suddenly enormously grateful thank you god for leaving me one good eye and i'm not religious but there you are fast forward hours doctor 's office eye exam well , the eye specialist said , your left eye suffered a small retinal something or other at some time in the past and it healed on its own , apparently your right eye , on the other hand , has suffered a retinal tear and vitreous hemorrhage the doctor explained that my left eye had let loose a tiny chunk of retina some time ago years ago i remember when a floater appeared , but without causing any bleeding or additional retinal damage my good eye had let loose spalled , is the word i 'd use a tiny piece of retina and healed up on its own amazingly but my right eye had suffered a rip in the retina which , oddly , did n't distort my vision , with a tiny amount of bleeding the doctor explained that it takes only a small drop of blood , inside the vitreous humor , to completely cloud your vision we should do a procedure at once , the doctor said then he described it laser surgery to spot weld the retina , around the area of the tear , to keep the tear from progressing any further we discussed it for about five , maybe ten nanoseconds , before i cried yes yes yes do the procedure at once ! the doctor brought a machine up to my eye and told me to look at his ear zap zap zap zap zap green strobe brighter than the sun , blinding to the point of metaphysical enlightenment , or or zaps , maybe more then a pause then zap zap zap again , or or times then a pause any pain ? nothing , i said zap zap zap zap zap zap zap zap zap zap in minutes , he was done i went out of the office with sunglasses on , the throwaway kind they give you after dilation , grateful to be able to see out of my good eye my wife drove us home so what happens is , after you get the retinal damage area cordoned off with laser spot welds , you let the eye recover on its own for up to months , maybe more the eye can clear the vitreous humor of debris blood cells , clots , etc at a rate of about a day , on its own if all goes right and it 's been going right after days , i can report that my right eye has cleared up by at least i can see through the cloud of debris , a little bit , now i can see words on a screen sometimes with the aid of glasses my left eye does the heavy lifting it can still manage vision , albeit with a floater in the way and reading glasses to help , but hey that 's better than nothing by a lot , it turns out so i 've written the last several blogs and days' worth of tweets in a vision impaired state and my wife offered to go to california to find us an apartment , on her own i just took her to the airport an hour ago and i 'll be working , for real , in a full time tech writer job , again soon and have health insurance again soon , and god willing , the many other non trivial personal travails of which i 've said nothing , in this blog or elsewhere , over the past year because i was born with the do n't whine gene which of course means i have n't mentioned any of this to my new employer may soon come to a resolution and i may yet go back to being a productive member of society , in as little as a month and then you know what will happen ?
