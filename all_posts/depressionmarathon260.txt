i'm continuing to put one foot in front of the other here , but my mood remains low i'm busy looking for hours to work right now i'm scheduled to work the next four days in a row , which is good , but i'm a little nervous about working four days in a row as most of you know , i usually work every other day i expect i 'll be worn out in four days , but i'm just going to take it one day at a time , one moment at a time , and attempt to keep the worry thoughts at bay i'm utilizing my support system to get through the low mood one of the things i'm dealing with is feeling overwhelmed simple things which otherwise would n't register suddenly become overwhelming when my mood is low it 's frustrating but i'm reaching out i'm doing what my support people recommend instead of pulling the covers over my head , i'm sticking to my schedule and also getting my exercise in i 'll make it through i can do anything i set my mind to if i stay in the moment and keep moving forward that 's what i'm trying to do
