alternative approach to my cancer care by heather von st james , this is a guest post every cancer patient and survivor i know , has their life divided into two distinct parts the life before cancer , and the life after the diagnosis my life forever changed on november st , when i was given a pleural mesothelioma diagnosis , just months after the birth of my first and only child just what is pleural mesothelioma ? it is a rare cancer of the lining of the lung that is particularly brutal with a typical mesothelioma life expectancy of only a few months after diagnosis mesothelioma is almost always associated with asbestos exposure i am one of the lucky ones , i have survived years since i chose to do an extreme surgery called an extra pleural pneumonectomy what this surgery consists of is removing the tumor , the entire left lung and all surrounding tissue ! including the diaphragm , and lining of the heart , which was replaced with surgical gore tex and also the removal of my th rib during the surgery i had a heated chemo wash , to further ensure the destruction of any cancer cells when one is given a cancer diagnosis , something strange happens , you will do what ever it takes to get rid of it , and also do anything to feel better with all of the chemical warfare going on inside of my body , i felt compelled to seek out alternative therapies that would not interfere with the chemotherapy i knew i had to do the chemo and radiation but also knew there were other things i could do to make the journey easier i sought out various forms of healing work , reiki , energy work , good old fashioned prayer with my pastor , and also when i started feeling better , i started yoga as luck would have it my sister , who was my caregiver directly after surgery , is also a reiki master and would do daily sessions of reiki on me which helped me relax , and helped me sleep , when i went home to mn and she home to or , we made reiki dates where i would call her , and over the phone she would even perform reiki and it had the same result ! i sought out prayer with my pastor , as much for mental and physical reasons as spiritual my faith in god and his healing is a big part of my journey , many prayer sessions were had , and each one grounded me in my faith and my resolve to beat this disease the energy work and yoga go hand in hand with the other therapies , all about calming the mind , strengthening the body and spirit i believe that these approaches along with the traditional medicine prescribed have really helped me , not only live , but thrive
