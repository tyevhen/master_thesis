what emotion goes with the trigger ? how did i overspend ? then , she wrote a narrative about how she felt about this incident of overspending when she first began writing in her journal , ann was writing about the event after the fact most of the time because she was still struggling with her impulse to overspend developing an awareness before she gave into her impulse was very challenging at first but even after she was more aware and she realized that she was about to give into the impulse , she would bargain with herself by telling herself that this would be the last time unfortunately , there were many so called last times before she could get to the point where she could catch herself before she gave into the impulse eventually , ann was able to write in her journal when she got the urge to overspend and she learned not to give in most of the time the challenge after that was for ann to deal with the uncomfortable feelings that were at the start of her impulsive cycles of overspending , and we did this in her therapy learning to cope developing the capacity to tolerate uncomfortable feelings since the impulse to ward off uncomfortable feelings is usually at the beginning of the cycle of overspending , developing an ability to identify them and the capacity to tolerate uncomfortable feelings is an important part of the work in therapy during the course of a lifetime , everyone experiences loss , small trauma and , for many people , big trauma if , for whatever reason , you never developed the capacity to tolerate uncomfortable feelings , you can be at risk for engaging in impulsive behavior and if you 're already engaging in impulsive behavior , it 's harder to stop until you develop this capacity getting help along with attending debtors anonymous , many people have been helped by working with a licensed psychotherapist who has an expertise in helping people who have problems with overspending , especially when they 're attempting to deal with their emotional triggers learn to stop overspending as a way to deal with uncomfortable feelings if you have problems with overspending , you owe it to yourself and your loved ones to get help avoiding the problem will only result in the problem getting worse since , like most impulse control problems , problems with overspending is progressive and gets worse over time getting help from a licensed therapist can help you to lead a more satisfying and meaningful life i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist who works with individual adults and couples i have helped many people to overcome their impulsive habits , including overspending , so they can lead more fulfilling lives to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at or email me josephineolivia aol com photo credit tracy o via photopin cc photo credit plousia via photopin cc photo credit k via photopin cc
