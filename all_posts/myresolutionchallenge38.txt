project you ! week self love starts on the inside last week we looked at abandoning our to do list , you can read that post here today , i want to talk about self love it s a phrase that many of us struggle with and one that i ve pondered over many times last year i joined a slimming group in the hope of shedding the two stone in weight that crept on during the initial months of my ill health i thought that by losing the weight , i would start to feel better about myself losing weight and feeling fitter and healthier , slimmer and more energetic is a worthy goal but it doesn t change the essence of who we are i look in the mirror and still see the dark circles under my eyes , the stretch marks and laughter lines ' losing weight won t change that i just need to embrace everything as a whole inside and out i have a scar on my right eyebrow , caused during a game of british bull dog back in the s i have small marks on my face which i believe to be sun damage my left foot is smaller than the other foot , and my right boob is slightly bigger ! these are the quirks that make up who i am no amount of weight lifting , running , clothes shopping or makeup can wipe away my unique features why are we so critical of ourselves ? if a loved one or friend mentioned their loathing of a misshapen nose or a sprinkling of freckles , we would be the first to tell them how lovely they are so why can t we turn this love around and praise our own bodies ? i was writing in my journal last night and spent a few minutes reading over old entries i noticed how often my shape and weight was mentioned i d either confessed to over eating and the guilt i felt after , or revealed my close resemblance to a homeless person as i sat in my office wearing old joggers and a tatty top ! i didn t dare calculate how many hours of my life i ve wasted worrying about my appearance made all the more ridiculous when i realised that i work from home and can go days without seeing another living soul not counting my children and a crazy kitten if i hope to accept myself just as i am , i need to let go of old thoughts , feelings , and expectations and embrace the forty three year old shelley to do this , i need to see past the big nose , wobbly thighs and back fat and look at what i ve achieved in this body it s given birth to three wonderful children worth every stretch mark it s taken me around the world , giving me the strength and mobility to see a host of incredible things it s run a half marathon in memory of my cousin to begin our journey of self love , we need to begin seeing ourselves the way our friends and family do they see our beauty and strength don t you think you deserve to see the same ? i receive numerous comments about my smile and yet when i look at old photos i only see faults from now on i m going to try and look for the good bits and dismiss any negativity i challenge you to do the same use this affirmation every morning and night when you look in the mirror i love my body and cherish it every day of my life i d love to hear your thoughts on this post
