it was n't my best day today , but it was n't my worst either i had hopes going into today 's dallas marathon of perhaps bettering my time from the twin cities marathon in october , but it was not meant to be i may have started too fast i think that may be what i find when i look at my mile splits later by mile , i was laboring , but i often have bad patches between miles and in a marathon , so that was n't totally unexpected i slowed my pace a bit , and tried to rest i began the self talk at that point in time , too just get to mile , and then , just get to mile , and then , , and that 's what i told myself i began walking up a long hill just after mile that hill did not level off until after mile i ran some of it and walked some of it between miles and i tried to run the whole way , and i think i did i got a tiny second wind i ran more than i walked all the way up to mile , but at that point my legs just quit i lost a lot of time over those last miles it was a struggle i was very happy to cross that finish line ! i finished in a respectable like i said , it was n't my best nor my worst race twin cities was much more enjoyable this one was a lot of work ! i'm pleased to have just completed my th career marathon that is something of which i am proud , especially as of those have been completed in just the past two years i think i 'll enjoy a little easy running for awhile of course , i'm already looking at the calendar toward my next marathon challenge !
