the dead the dead shall rise again the dead shall rise out of the sea they come , covered in flesh they are astounded at their newborn eyes will these bones live ? nothing can sanitize the worm within the shroud around the dress the dead shall rise again the dead shall rise not wiser for their absence , mouthing lies they lived and breathed , lying as they confess they are astounded at their newborn eyes christ said , come as a child no disguise can save them from the dreaded second death the dead shall rise again the dead shall rise they must submit there is no compromise it s them or god , and they are in excess they are astounded at their newborn eyes the sun sets on the dead by moonrise most are dead again in god s winepress the dead shall rise again the dead shall rise and be astounded at their newborn eyes i continue to be dull in my mind but my emotions are marginally better unlike my normal self , i have little to say i trust it 's the medication that 's doing this , flattening my affect , taking some of the noise inside my head away one good sign is a return of sexual interest , something i have sorely lacked these last eight months but i have been fooled before , thinking i was on the road to recovery , so i wo n't invest too much time in considering if i am better at least i am no worse i will continue to labor at poetic forms thanks for all the feedback i am not currently rating my mood because the microscopic attention i pay it may be bad for my mental health thine , ce
