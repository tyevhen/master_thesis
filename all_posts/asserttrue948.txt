moa continues to move forward rapidly some important web architectural memes are starting to come together in the form of things like feedflare api , ning atom api , and shorttext com if the latter would expose a rest api , it could become the clipboard of the web instead of merely the notepad of the web what 's interesting about the feedflare api is that it involves late evaluation of embedded xpath , giving mashers a nice combination of declarative and imperative styles to draw upon they also silently cast your rss to atom at parse time as more and more powerful mash apis come on the scene , and as people normalize on atom as a datagram format , json as an object passing serialization format , things like shorttext com for clipboard storage , etc , web reaches an architectural maturity level where the likelihood increases that someone will create the killer app that finally tips the tipping point away from ie for good , towards firefox , opera , and the web compatibles thereby locking microsoft out of a web future if it is n't locked out already the coming killer app will no doubt leverage one or another ie incompatible technology such as canvas and or ex and or greasemonkey and or svg and or some other cutting edge technology that 's fully available in firefox opera but not in ie mark it as a future i told you so
