variations in depth and type of trance both hilgard and erickson believe that there are definite , varying levels of hypnotic trance for example , there is a stuporous trance a state in which , according to hilgard , spontaneous thinking stops and the self becomes meaningless in hypnosis in the relief of pain , hilgard maintains that the notion of depth in hypnosis cannot really be measured and can only be described by the person experiencing it still , he gives this description of a person in an hypnotic stupor relaxation of the body increased for a time , but he the subject eventually no longer felt identified with his body it was as though it was a thing left behind , so that it no longer made sense to ask him further about body relaxation relaxation of the body was succeeded by a peacefulness of the self , but beyond a certain depth this concept also became meaningless , because the self was no longer present the environment also faded progressively , until finally a state was reached in which the only part of the environment that remained present was the hypnotist 's voice time passed more and more slowly , finally reaching a point at which it ceased to be a meaningful concept spontaneous mental activity declined until it finally reached zero another kind of trance is a somnambulistic one , in which mental and physical capacities apparently remain normal erickson made frequent use of the somnambulistic trance both for demonstration and for therapeutic purposes i ll now describe an example where erickson had called upon one individual to demonstrate the somnambulistic state he then pretended to conclude the demonstration and dismiss the subject but he continued , hoping to observe genuine hypnotic behavior rather than behavior designed to please the hypnotist knowing about the subject 's fondness for sweets , erickson told her that as a reward for her performance she could choose from a platter of homemade candy with the subject still in the somnambulistic state , she was asked to name her favorite candy , and expressed a marked preference for divinity fudge , and even as she spoke she was noted to salivate freely in anticipation the hypnotist went into another room , called back with satisfaction that there was indeed some divinity fudge , and asked her whether she wanted to help herself to it at once or later so far as divinity fudge is concerned , immediately is scarcely soon enough , she reportedly replied erickson then returned to the room bringing napkins , pretending that he had a platter of candy in his hands , and saying that the platter contained a variety of candies in case those present had different preferences next he approached the subject and told her to go ahead and select the largest pieces of divinity fudge with the juvenile directness , earnestness , and simplicity so characteristic of behavior in the somnambulistic state , she replied she would after scrutinizing the imaginary platter carefully , she made her choice of a piece and , upon urging , a second and a third , but she explained that she was taking only a small piece for the third the imaginary platter was passed among the group each person pretended to take a piece of candy and eat it the subject then became restless , wandered around the room , and finally sat in a chair next to the table where the imaginary platter had been placed subsequently , in the manner of a small child who wishes another helping of candy , she looked furtively back and forth between the imaginary platter and the hypnotist , until with a slight gesture of resolution she learned forward , scrutinized the platter carefully , and proceeded to go through a performance of selecting carefully and eating several pieces of candy , now and then glancing in a hesitant manner the platter was passed around again when it was her turn , the subject again selected and ate imaginary pieces of candy erickson notes that , throughout the performance , two medically trained members unobtrusively watched the subject and independently observed her increased salivation and swallowing , as well as her use of the napkin to wipe her fingers then erickson concluded the demonstration and awakened the subject thus , we have stuporous trances in which the environment , the body , and the self become meaningless concepts , and we have somnambulistic trances in which hallucinatory fudge is merrily eaten with the context of normal group interaction how can these states be possible ? are these reports mere fantasy or actual descriptions of altered neurological functioning ? and if the latter is true , which brain structures mediate hypnotic trance states ? ernest r hilgard and josephine r hilgard , hypnosis in the relief of pain los altos , ca william kaufmann , , p milton h erickson , experimentally elicited salivary and related responses to hypnotic visual hallucinations confirmed by personality reactions , collected papers of milton h erickson on hypnosis , vol , edited by ernest l rossi new york irvington , , pp originally published in psychosomatic medicine , april , , ,
