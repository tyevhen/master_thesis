i 've been quiet on the boy related posts these last months well to be honest , i 've been reluctant to spill the beans on my new relationship this is due to a couple of reasons one , because i did n't want to jinx things to ramble on about this boy and then nothing materialise two , because believe it or not i do n't like everybody knowing all of my business all the time and three , because some things are nice to just enjoy and not write moan overanalyse about over the last months however i have attempted many a blog post to share my boy updates , they just never really made the cut or i chickened out of posting at the very last minute i want to use this post to give those lovely written sentences their minutes of fame so here goes th november if you had n't realised by now , i have myself a boyfriend my absence in writing comes from a good place a place where i was reluctant to share all my boy goss quite frankly , i was afraid of slipping into my usual routine where things cock up and i spend the next few months and many blog posts analysing what exactly went wrong instead of sharing and risking all that drama i decided to keep schtum i also kept schtum because sometimes it 's nice not to share i realise that boy bipolar is much more fascinating to the outside world than a cute little love story the interest in reading about my dating disasters totally out weighs the popularity in reading about a lovely date night who cares how much i hold my bf 's hand as we stroll about at the weekend and who cares that he has his very own toothbrush sitting in my toothbrush holder no one not really anyway and that 's ok th august my summer fling has returned to uni or as he calls it 'college' he left last week , pretty much leaving for the airport from my front door i spent the next ten or so hours following his flight on a plane tracker app during his last few weeks we both kind of avoided the big leaving the country for weeks elephant in the room i simply did n't know how was i going to feel about it , so it was n't worth worrying about his last weekend we made sure was jam packed with fun we spent one day at the zoo and the next at a local festival with his friends needless to say we both got hammered it was under the influence of bucket cocktails that he confessed he was sad to be going back to uni , that he wanted to keep in touch and that we both admitted to having had amazing summers to be honest , during his last week i sensed a hint of dread hanging in the air the whole time all i kept thinking was 'this will the last time he sleeps over we have the day together we 'll watch crappy tele' it reminded me of my uni days and how i used to feel going back for a new term , leaving all my family and friends i was sad to be honest even though we had both said we would keep in touch it 's not quite the same it felt like the definite end of our my summer of fun
