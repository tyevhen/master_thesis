i am nearing the end of my second hospital stay my mood is improving it 's not perfect , but it is better than it was the current plan is for one more ect treatment on friday , and then i will go home saturday i miss jet so , so much ! i ca n't wait to see him and to get back into our routine i am especially looking forward to getting outside and at least walking , hopefully running , with jet despite the fact that there are two treadmills and a stationary bike on this unit , i have not been able to motivate to do more than minutes of biking , once i have no desire to do any more than that i need to get back outside i know i'm going to be disappointed in how much fitness i have certainly lost over the last weeks hopefully , it wo n't take too terribly long to regain what i 've let go i 've already decided i wo n't be running the oklahoma city marathon in late april , which i had tentatively entered into my schedule a few weeks ago the next marathon on the list will now be memorial day weekend i'm anxious to get back to work , too i spoke with my boss today , and despite an e mail from my company to the contrary , she assured me they were not looking to replace me that was a relief , although it was still a little baffling and concerning that my company was advertising my position i know i should n't rush back to work , but financially speaking i really have no choice i need to restart the income as soon as possible i hope i'm ready to go when i leave here thank you all , again , for your wonderfully supportive and encouraging comments during this difficult time i am so lucky to have an audience with each of you , my loyal readers i do n't take that for granted i 'll never be able to balance the scales , but i 'll do my best to offer each of you just a sliver of the hope you offer me carry on , my friends !
