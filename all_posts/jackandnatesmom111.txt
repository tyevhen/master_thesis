just wanted to give you all a quick update on nate he has been on his fluconazole and flagyl for approximately days now , and the mitochondrial cocktail for days he is taking all of these like a champ we have gotten very lucky in that regard as he has accepted them all in his juice side effects , let s see sorry squeamish readers , but he is having really stinky grainy loose stool this is a sign that the fluconazole may be working he also has been extremely stimmy , which is another sign of what is called die off , basically a worsening of those symptoms because of the by products of the yeast dying so it s a negative thing that hopefully will lead to improvement in the long run as an added bonus , nathan has not slept through the night since , umm , last tuesday night i think ? he is my sleeper , so this really stinks this could be one of two things more die off symptoms , or something in the mitochondrial cocktail is having some effect only time will tell if that is a positive or negative effect it could be awakening of some neural connections , or it could be that one of the supplements in the cocktail is very activating to him and cause some hyper stimulation we need to wait it out for now , as no matter what is going on , this side effect could be a transient one or , if there are a lot of other more positive effects , this side effect could be helped with melatonin and may be worth dealing with either way , when he is awake at night all he wants on earth is to be squeezed arms , legs , feet , you name it , he wants deep pressure he has also been more fussy possibly lack of sleep , but he also seems to be over stimulated more easily he had a rough time at his grand mom s house yesterday lots of crying , didn t eat a thing , grabbed my hand and led me to the front door time to leave mom , etc have we seen anything really good ? john and i are saying this nathan is having a good week his speech , not necessarily increased , but definitely more consistent his little attitude is alive and well my dear john , devoted daddy that he is , continues to try for night night from nate each night tonight , he was leaning over nate while he did this , giving him some deep pressure , and nate pushed his leg onto john s arm , smiled behind his thumb , and instead of night night , said kick little stinkerj also , the other day , i handed him his juice and he just very casually said thank you these are definitely positive things and that is as far as i am willing to think right now i went through another phone interview with nih today it made me cry , what else is new they were asking developmental questions for a good minutes how often does he nod his head yes never , how often does he wave never , does he use at least words a day sometimes , how often does he respond to his name sometimes , how often does he engage in imaginary play never ok , so i have to admit that the interviewer made me laugh twice she would ask all of these serious questions to which she received pretty depressing answers , and then would wrap up the line of questioning and in her defense she was clearly reading from a script with something like do you feel that nathan uses the typical amount of language for a child his age ? or the kicker have you ever had developmental concerns about nathan ? seriously ? nah he 's just introverted ? ! ? so that s where we are for now mommy is finally getting a bit of relief from a migraine that was closing in on days which has been happening about times a month the past few months i got a new migraine script today from my pcp and a referral to a neurologist in addition , after listening to all that has been going on she insisted on writing me a prescription for xanax ha she was like and why do you not have this ? like every day ? that part was a bit of a joke , but she s right , there are times when it s just necessary and contrary to what i would like to believe , i am not wonder woman just feel a bit sorry for the kids , because this mama is so drug na ve that if i take it at bedtime , it s going to take a lot of noise to wake me up ! anyway , hopefully this will help
