great article in the new york times magazine , called a life or death decision , by robin maranz henig , about an ethicist peggy battin , who teaches and writes on the right to self determination and end of life decisions her husband , also a college professor , suffered a severe head injury while bike riding , leaving him a wheel chair bound , machine dependent quadriplegic , a year after he 'd written a living will forbidding the use of measures to unnaturally prolong or postpone the dying process in the years since the accident in , her husband , brooke hopkins , has required around the clock care to maintain his breathing , a feeding tube , and an enormously expensive motorized wheelchair for mobility , and a quarter of a million dollars a year spent on aides who help him around the clock he 's been in and out of the hospital , and what 's striking is that from the time dr hopkins wrote his advance directive , he changed his mind now the couple struggle with the dynamic that sometimes he says he wants to die , his wife ignores his requests because she believes he does n't really mean it , and generally he later says that in fact , he 's glad measures were taken that kept him alive dr brooke is able to read with a voice commanded computer screen and co teaches a courses in his home i'm all in favor of advance directives and the right to die with dignity in a situation where healthcare prolongs the inevitable death this story , however , was extremely confusing one member of the couple is a bioethicist whose career has revolved around these issues the other is a gentleman with a head injury , an impaired lifestyle requiring extreme measures of support , a general or so portrayed happy and positive outlook who is still culling meaning from life and contributing to society , and yet , there is no absolute way he can say enough he tried in a final letter because any such statements are felt to be transient , reflective of a momentary state of distress that will pass , and so in a catch , it 's not quite clear that he can ever practice what his wife teaches i will mention that the article had a single passing reference to the fact that dr hopkins ph d from harvard , athlete , risk taker , life of the party , and esteemed college professor suffered from bipolar disorder , and aside from that single mention , it was never part of the discussion as to why he should n't call the shots on his life , have an advance directive , or called into question as a reason why he might be changing his mind about wanting to live or to die bipolar disorder got a mention , but it does not sound to be what defines dr hopkins so what do you think ? how do we ever really know for sure what someone wants if they change their mind or waiver during moments of crisis ?
