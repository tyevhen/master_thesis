two stellar 's jays went skittering up two young firs this morning , half heartedly pecking for insects , making dead branches bounce and spring their blue is iridescent , the male has a black crest the abalone shells i lay hollow down on the railing have been weathered until the mother of pearl shines through their coral pink external shell as well my failure is ambivalence i fear to commit for fear of failure i fear to commit for fear of success i fear to risk my whole self publicly i fear condemning eyes , electric sneers my wife says , either swallow it or choke on it i'm definitely choking if you 're not part of the problem , you 're not part of the solution how ringo 's minimalist drumming so suits the beatles yes , it 's church of the beatles sunday what seeds did i plant yesterday ? dill , creeping dill , italian parsley , thyme , snow peas , nasturtiums and marigolds they are now in the yard under the little white pup tent of a frost barrier with my poppy seedlings why i know i'm depressed if someone offered me ect today i would go one of my depressive thoughts is always , how can that bus driver bartender , janitor , waitress , cook , etc possibly perform her job ? how did she learn to drive a bus ? how does she do it ? after graduating from ucla i took a job in a fabric warehouse schlepping fabric rolls it was as painful as any job because of my own perfectionism , its dullness did not diminish my ambition to do a good job near the end of the summer they asked me to be assistant manager i had to laugh as depressed as i was , seeking refuge in repetitive employment , i was still singled out for advancement as for dwelling too much on my malady , if you had to piece reality together from past clues , as your present seems unendurable , you , too might seek your bearings on paper my kilorat scale is wrong , you know roger dier was not too depressed to care for a thousand rats if he were too depressed to care for any rats at all , he would be at zero rats , not ten kilorats and as a behavioral measure it is utterly impractical even if well i would prefer not to care for a single rat but how many could i care for ? could and want as rhetorical competitors are both superior to have to my main symptom now is an acute lack of confidence and a fear of filling the day perhaps as a reaction to the above i sent out four submissions in the last two days , including a query for my novel my approach to publication is completely illogical if someone sends me even a generic solicitation , i 'll usually submit otherwise i ca n't be bothered except when i go into a duotrope 's digest fit and start submitting to all kinds strange zines , though for the most part i am unwilling to lick stamps , still a severe limitation but not with the new yorker ! if i wanted publicity , my main mistake was in closing melic never believe that being an editor of a well regarded magazine does n't help you as a writer people notice you you have a certain amount of power and receive a certain amount of deference one reason i closed the magazine , besides the board 's final destruction by the barbarians , was to focus more on my own writing ironic , hmm ? i should have thought more about marketing wait now i remember the main reason i elected to close melic inadequate technical support you may notice that many editors are also webmasters , a terrific advantage we can always open the magazine it 's officially on hiatus all we need is a good and savvy webmaster ! pay is low , job satisfaction high if this proposition interests anyone , write me ! when i felt better briefly two weeks ago , when i first started taking adderall , the future appeared to me i would expand my website to include sales and self publish it seemed like the right thing to do it seemed obvious , in fact but since my mood dipped again after the misunderstanding with kathleen , everything appears impossible again so i dabble and start some desultory queries in the groundless hope that someone might publish me i have three rejections of my novel so far , the most damning being that in the amazon first novel contest i did n't even make the cut of the top thousand out of five thousand move over charlie brown , let me try to kick the football just because my kilorat scale is mathematically incorrect does n't mean that i do n't still intend to use it at kilorats but masked by adderall , ce
