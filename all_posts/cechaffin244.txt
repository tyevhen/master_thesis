two weeks into ect and i'm not doing very well i feel in danger of complete relapse what precipitated it was my sister 's generous suggestion to have a driver take me home for the weekend to mendocino my sister 's too good of a soul to say , it 's been almost three weeks and you 're a space eater and i 'd like my house and nuclear family back , but that has to be part of it , too , and i understand even though i try to make myself scarce , hiding in the basement with a book , going for walks , i am nevertheless an interloper , a species not native to this house , like a northern pike in a trout lake the thought of seeing my one true love , kathleen , while still depressed , was too much to bear i so want to get well for her i want her suffering to end , and because of the love she bears me her suffering can only end when i am stable and my depression is in remission as my illness began on april , , it will soon be of two year 's duration , with only two partial and brief remissions i'm a sick puppy i ca n't imagine being in kathleen 's position i have been with her during her depressions but she 's never had one this protracted and treatment resistantant since i 've known her nothing makes me sadder than the thought that my presence will sadden kathleen we had such hopes for this treatment ! obviously i need more , but how much will be enough ? and i'm wondering if i should n't be on stronger medications as well to try to help stabilize my mood during treatment in any case i broke down in tears in front of my sister after treatment today , not a good thing i also forgot a lunch date i 'd made with a poet from san francisco the overwhelming emotion of my situation caused me to forget i did call him and told him i had a good excuse for forgetfulness sorry , i had electroconvulsive therapy this morning he likely did n't need to hear that and was probably relieved not to have lunch with me afterwards , though he said he still wanted to meet oh well i would n't have been very good company in any case i just finished margaret atwood 's the blind assassin , which my sister recommended atwood 's work always humbles me and i did find this book alluring i got a note from sam rasnake today that soon a new issue of blue fifth review will be out and had forgotten that i had a poem in it , home surgery i 'll have another poem in barnwood a paying venue and three in umbrella niederngasse has also accepted a poem , as has barefoot muse these are all pretty good venues and i 'll post the links again when my work comes out meanwhile you do n't need me as an excuse to visit these fine e zines ! see that ? talking about something besides myself , like literature , helped the tears dry up i try to explain to craig that he 's not worth crying over but he does n't get it so , having mentioned a number of poems you ca n't see yet , here 's one i wrote the other day in san francisco something christian rheumy eyes , mahogany head tan polyester coat , white shirt no tie septuagenarian tiny chinese american stood on a folding two step stepladder of aluminum in union square and preached homo sick ! queer go to hell ! aids wrath of god i must say i 've never understood why jesus hates queers more than other men besides , if god has time to invent new scourges to punish the innocent babies guilty of birth , patients guilty of transfusion , doctors guilty of defective gloves maybe i'm on the wrong side ? the city is filled with sin ! how must it feel behind those rheumy eyes to hate and think god 's work is being done ? you look unhappy , i offered , your eyes are filled with hate i hate the devil and i hate sin , he said , his thin lips set in a maginot line no , no , you hate yourself , i said his look of incomprehension was almost beyond redemption i should have passed and said nothing like the other pedestrians but something christian wanted out pray for me in whatever way approximates prayer for you if you are an atheist you can wish for new treatments for depression , for instance in need of a miracle , ce
