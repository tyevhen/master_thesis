last week i talked about taking things one step at a time , you can read that post here it s a wise idea to break any goal down into smaller chunks , but this doesn t automatically make us exempt from sabotaging ourselves further along the path to succeed , we not only need a plan , or structure , but we need to be attentive to our needs if we don t nourish our ideas , and indeed ourselves , then we can trip up at the first hurdle being diligent and planning ahead , or putting in the effort when it s needed , can be the difference between success and failure however , being determined could be mistaken as perfectionism could you cope with a setback ? would you fall apart when faced with a failure ? if you can t accept that it s okay not to be perfect , then you may risk creating a huge barrier to achieving your goals it s quite freeing to be able to say , okay , i ve had a speed wobble , but it s not the end of the world i ve learnt from it , and i m ready to give it another go i ve had more speed wobbles throughout my life than i can remember weight loss is one area i always failed at if i didn t allow myself a naughty day when i used to have one too many custard creams i would feel like an utter failure , tell myself i d nosedived beyond repair , and bury my head in a victoria sponge cake now , i don t even see it as a slip up anymore i enjoy a naughty treat and then get straight back to my healthy eating no guilt , no more slip ups so the next time you have a goal in mind , have planned your baby steps and are motivated to succeed , remember to allow yourself an off day only then can you enjoy the journey
