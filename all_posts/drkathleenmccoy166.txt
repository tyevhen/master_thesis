i retired two years ago today it 's interesting to think about how life has changed in these two years and how distant the time before seems the changes in april were profound i retired my husband retired we closed escrow on the sale of our home of years and , bundling our three surprisingly calm cats into the back seat of our honda civic , we relocated miles from l a to rural arizona all in a nine day period life was too frantic for prolonged goodbyes and looks back then now that we 're settled into our new life , i think about the time before what i miss and what i do n't one list is shorter than the other what i miss i find i miss certain people the most friends since childhood , friends from years of work , my commuter bus buddies from joyous driver nelson who actually loved navigating the freeway and my friend irene rodriguez , with whom , over five years of commuting to work at ucla , i shared so many impassioned political discussions as the bus crawled through endless hours of freeway congestion lately , there have been many times when i 've heard a bit of political insanity and have longed to carry on about it with irene email and phone visits back and forth are fun but nothing quite beats the joy of whispered ranting and laughing with irene on the bus there are times when i miss those heady days of my writing career when oprah and the today show and usa today were calling and i miss those days when , as a therapist , i felt deep satisfaction in making a difference to a patient , perhaps easing their sadness , perhaps helping them to rediscover their own strengths but such times had largely faded into warm , personal memories well before my actual retirement i miss the easy availability of favorite places the beach , the mountains , favorite stores and restaurants but mostly i miss being geographically close to family and some treasured friends what i do n't miss at all horrific l a commutes and planning life events to avoid getting stuck in traffic the stress of multiple jobs and responsibilities or to be honest working any job sunday afternoon depressions , knowing the next day started another work week getting up at a m for the commute to work fear of layoffs office politics the times of not seeing the light of day , of missing whole seasons because of my frantic work schedule , never feeling my time was truly my own general workplace pettiness and insanity especially the instances in several workplaces over the last years of working where i was sternly instructed to keep my previous or ongoing writing achievements a guilty secret lest the knowledge of these upset , threaten or cause resentment among co workers the heartbreak largely because of such secrets of not being authentic , not being myself for too many of those last years although i'm grateful to have been continuously employed except for one awful year in the early nineties and to have met many wonderful people in the course of years of working , i do n't miss the times of working for others at all and while i loved working for many years as a full time freelance writer , i do n't miss the financial anxiety of dealing with the ups and downs of the publishing industry only now , when i have a retirement income that does n't require huge investments of my time and energy , can i write with a sense of freedom and joy in finding my own voice , and taking the risk of writing what pleases me i'm so grateful for the opportunities that come with retirement i feel so blessed to have these years of relative good health and lingering young old age , to write with an open heart and mind , to embrace each day as my own , to be fully myself perhaps for the first time ever
