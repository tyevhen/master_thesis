as i was driving to work this week i learned that a giant asteroid was hurtling toward earth and would be visible to the naked eye sometime tonight the radio station i was listening to then switched immediately into a chirpy , cheery commercial for glad ziplock sandwich bags asteroid ? giant asteroid ? near miss ? no big deal as long as your sandwiches are fresh i'm sure homeland security has this covered the asteroid , xp , was originally discovered by an observatory in new mexico in it is about a half a mile km in diameter the jet propulsion laboratory 's near earth orbit project can trace out its trajectory and we 've been assured it wo n't actually hit the earth you can even watch a cool little java animation of the asteroid 's path maybe it 's me , both those little moving dots labelled 'earth' and 'xp' do seem to touch all these measurements and predictions are made by very smart people with degrees in astronomy and physics and other relevant stuff personally , i'm a little reluctant to believe that anything with the term xp in its name wo n't crash at least once the reason why i'm bring this up is because it got me thinking about death and hot fudge sundaes and about my prisoners , of course so often i get parole violaters coming back into the system who say why did they pick me up ? i should n't be here i was doing everything right and all i can say is sometimes bad things happen even when you do everything right sometimes bad things happen because you do the right thing asteroids happen
