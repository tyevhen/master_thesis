from in hindsight i realize that my math was wrong if in a mild depression a man can take care of rats , in a maximum depression he should n't be able to handle even one instead i inflated the scale to kilorats with ten kilorats being the maximum measure of depression despite the error , i kind of like kilorats and have stayed with it since no more need for the hamilton depression inventory or other studied tools of medical discovery a man in petaluma , ca , has provided us with a new measure of depression last week roger dier was apprehended with rats in his apartment , mostly in cages , some free range everything in his small house had been gnawed on he had to buy lbs of rat food every five days to support his charges he slept at his office to avoid the smell and noise of his own menagerie at night from the santa rosa press democrat dier said depression , loneliness , denial and his recent bout with ill health were to blame for the rats so , this guy who claims to be depressed nevertheless has it together to schlepp lbs of rat food every five days to spare these dear creatures ? the horde , incidentally , began when roger spared a baby rat trying to escape from being dinner for his three foot python , who would not eat dead rodents frankly , i do n't think much of this fellow 's depression a rat depression must therefore be considered fairly mild i mean , he 's still feeding the rats ! so his depression must weigh less than lbs later in the same article roger is quoted i did not set out to do this i do acknowledge irresponsibility and there 's a case for laziness , denial , incompetence and just plain foolishness but , it was not all my fault , he added it was this force of nature that overwhelmed me more i was aware of the crushing burden of having to take care of them all , he said for starters , whether i were depressed or manic , i would have it together not to be overwhelmed by pet rats i mean , one would have to be beyond using toilet paper to be so neglectful of reality nearly catatonic with self neglect and this guy was n't i think this something dude is just an elder slacker seriously , how depressed could he be ? he still has feelings for the rats , which means he still has some positive feelings for himself and he ca n't bear to face the holocaust of their future he 's the oskar schindler of rodents ! so much to live for in another article i learned that animal hoarders are typically women and involve cats , which made roger 's case even more interesting in a true depression i would not feel qualified to care for rats maybe i could manage one dog or cat yet the serious depressive might give his beloved pet up for fear that association with its owner could be having a deleterious effect upon the poor animal so , a rat depression i take as a mild depression henceforth i propose that all depressions be estimated in kilorats the upper limit might be kilorats , for which i nominate melancholic catatonia naturally , the depression of suicides must be excluded , not only because they must communicate from beyond the grave but because their participation would be unfair to those of us who have never summoned the courage besides , suicide is for wimps i 've had worse depressions when i felt that suicide would draw unwarranted attention to myself , which i did not deserve , hence suicide would be crediting myself with too much importance i 'd give that sort of depression nine kilorats , as well as any depression requiring ect right now i 'd rate myself at two kilorats my depression has been slowly improving , as you can see by the lighter material offered today watch your kilorats if you get over three , please see a doctor , but do n't bother me , i just play one on the net until the next post , ce
