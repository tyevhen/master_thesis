i'm posting over my fellow co bloggers today so what else is new ? please visit hot grand rounds the summer solstice medical blog posts with the pretty pictures , including a pink urinal with teeth one could ask for anything more ? and please visit clink 's post over on our shrink rap news blog on ethical issues related to the psychological report on the suspected anthrax killer when you 're finished reading , please return here to comment for a while now , we 've been having discussions in our comment sections about the issue of forced treatment is it right or is it wrong ? some readers are very clear no matter how sick , no matter how imminently dangerous , no one should be held in a hospital ever against their will one reader tells us that suicide is a right of all persons as per their free will , and by the way , psychiatrists ca n't predict acts of violence and have no right pretending they can they should stand up to the legal system and say so , and not go along with the charade both ideas got me wondering is suicidal behavior that results in the attention of mental health professionals really a product of free will ? as psychiatrists , many of us believe that people have unconscious motivations they are guided by beliefs they are unaware they hold people commit suicide all the time in , , people in the united states committed suicide , making it the th ranked cause of death somehow they did it despite the proliferation of mental health professionals many completed suicide with firearms , and my guess is that these deaths often occur without the immediate involvement of psychiatrists those who wish to exert their free will to die often do so without alerting others or involving professional helpers it leads me to wonder if those that present to emergency rooms or to their outpatient psychiatrists might do so because they have an unconscious or not so unconscious desire to be stopped of course there are exceptions those who are pulled off bridges , or discovered after a serious attempt that did not kill them do we not summon medical care for an unconscious overdose victim on the theory that they may have wanted to die and we 're interfering with the advancement of their free will ? we put up a poll a few weeks ago where we asked if people would want to be treated by force if they had an episode of severe mental illness of our respondents , a majority , , said yes while said no would the answers have been different if i 'd asked a more provocative question if you became psychotic and believed it necessary to kill your children , would you want to be treated ? it 's too provocative a question for a poll , but i thought i 'd throw it out there if you became demented , agitated , and combative towards those caring for you , would you want to be treated with a medication that increased your risk of death over the next year from to ? do n't worry , i wo n't be that provocative the issue of predicting violence is an interesting one , and our reader is right that we 're not terribly good at it our most powerful magical tool is to ask the patient if they 're planning to harm themselves or anyone else , and the truth is sometimes more legal than medical we 're told that if we do n't ask and document , that if someone kills themselves , we 'd lose a malpractice suit it does get boring asking perfectly well appearing people if they 're thinking about suicide and homicide on each visit , but it is a required check box at the clinic if they say yes , we ask about a plan and intent , and it does seem it might be troublesome to the family if a hospital discharges a person who says they plan to leave to go shoot up a mall or someone who has been actively psychotic , disorganized , and behaving in a dangerous manner there 's medico legal issues , but there is also common sense and kindness , and if you believe that someone who puts the barrier of the mental health field in the way of their violence may actually want help , even if they do n't put it in those terms , then there is little to argue about oh , go ahead , argue anyway free will ? so many people who survive suicide attempts are glad they did so many who attempt do so for impulsive reasons that pass , or because they were intoxicated i'm not much for condoning a permanent solution to what are often temporary problems if you want to tell us that you were hospitalized for suicidal ideation , this is another post for another day i'm still thinking about that one
