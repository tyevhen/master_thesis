well , it 's nearly pm so valerie 's guest post will be a thursday giveaway , because i figured most of you were busy halloweening ! we had a great time here , but nothing as exciting as halloween in japan on the navy base we had hundreds of little japanese munchkins all wide eyed with excitement over their first trick or treat experience ! daisy the pug pumpkin was the star of many , many families' halloween photos ! this year daisy was a pumpkin again , but we have added rescue dog riley to the mix happy halloween from my family to yours ! hugs , alyssa
