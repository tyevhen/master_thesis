i am just figuring out all this html business , so it is only natural for me to experiment with it i am halfway thinking about changing the background every day if you are one of those people who is diametrically opposed to change , i am sincerely sorry but change means no more mustard yellow and that is a good thing , i think just in case you are still hurt about this , i drew you a picture of a raptor to make you feel better today 's background is a picture i took of one of my shirts i know it 's cool , but do n't get too attached to it it may be totally different tomorrow i am also learning how to add videos to my blog if you think my sense of humor is random in written word , just wait until you see my videos anyway , if you have any suggestions or things you would like to see on my blog , please let me know i am now somewhat competent to oblige your wishes
