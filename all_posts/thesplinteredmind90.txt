it is wensday i will be writing soon on a book and everything maybe even my current book the question is what delayed me ? after all , the week began three days ago and wensday 's such an awkward day to begin the week 's half gone it 's not even spelled correctly friday , my addaboy ! writing day , is right around the corner that means i have to park my novel for another spell of blogging the more i think about it , the more i realize that i am not happy about this wait , was n't there a question ? right what delayed me ? i think i have the answer this is a tweetstats chart of my twitter activity for splinteredmind douglascootey shares similar stats , but is less active the chart is a great visual record of when i m awake in short , i m working at the wrong times of the day , and i m taking too long to get fired up and working as you can see , my sleep schedule is turned around again by the time i go to write , the girls are home and , unlike many supermom writers that i know , i ca n't write and watch kids at the same time it s one or the other , and usually the other wins first thing every morning i catch up on news with twitter and blogs i eat i get ready for the day then the girls come home i take care of them and , if i m not ticking , i drive them around any work i do is stretched out in fits and starts then in the evening when the girls are in bed , i tweet less and work more , but i m tired after taking care of kids for six to eight hours everything i work on takes forever to finish this blog took four hours with all the distractions yes , i did other things , but it s not an optimal schedule for my mind as much as i enjoy the quiet serenity of the night owl life , the only time i can truly write uninterrupted with full energy is when the girls are at school in order to do that , however , i need to be awake and writing first in my day , not last this gives me three goals to work on turn my sleep schedule around insomnia write at the right time of day without distractions adhd lastly , as i mentioned the other day , write the addaboy ! articles faster adhd i ll revisit these stats in a month s time to see how i m doing i 'll likely need reminders i either learn how to master my adhd insomnia , or i ll never finish my books the only other alternative is to be a ok with underachieving no thank you
