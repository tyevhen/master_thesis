so for my twenty second birthday which was last summer , basically an eon ago my dad had planned on flying me to new york and taking me to see hamilton on broadway i ca n't tell you how emotional i got when he told me that he was going to do that for me i have an amazing dad , he does n't even like musicals i could n't believe he was actually going to do it he even had the money put aside but things happened , and we ended up not going i told him just the thought that he was going to , was enough for me to be honest i'm kinda glad it fell through , because i would 've felt bad we have plenty of other things we could spend money on so he decided to take me to storybrooke instead for those you who do n't know storybrooke is a fictional place where most of the show 'once upon a time' is filmed which is a fairy tale based show that twists up all the classics i adore it ! it has one of my favorite villains of all time , rumpelstiltskin ! i named my cat after him the love is real ! also this handsome devil actually the whole cast is pretty fantastic , i would highly recommend so of course , i was insanely excited for this trip i found out that storybrook is filmed in a very real place called steveson which happens to be only half a day 's trip from where i live most of the time on any normal day you might only recognize a few things from the show , like granny 's or the library without the clock tower because that is cgi so basically a few times a month when they film , they have a crew come in and set up the storybrook stuff , change some signs , park some cars with maine on the license plate they then film for one or two days then take it down we had really fantastic fish chips , which is one of my favorite meals to have plus it was pretty foggy and chilly so it seemed to fit it 's really cool , because all of the stores excluding granny 's are open while filming they block off the areas that are filming and you have to wait until they yell , to be able to go down the street a lot of people show up for it , so it 's pretty cool it was raining , super hard that day , so sadly we did n't get to meet any of the actors we watched them film some scenes from street rats , i think the episode was called , so the people i did see from a distance were emma swan and aladdin there was also this really cool looking extra in a blue coat and steampunk outfit he walked past the window where we were eating , but i sadly did n't get a picture we thought he was going to be a character , but he is n't even in any of the scenes not even the background we were a little disappointed we stood in the rain for over an hour , walk around , it 's a super cool little town went into shops and hung out on the wharf , then we stopped for london fogs to warm up , and went home all and all it was a pretty awesome day
