first , as to the poetry contest here and at facebook i 've received only four entries thus far which make the odds of winning i'm sure there are many of you waiting until the april deadline , just be sure to get your entries in with your taxes and do n't forget to send me the refund today , at some cost to my back , i rototilled the garden and planted some spring flowers to go with those already blooming my goal is to have the whole yard littered in color i'm trying mainly to plant the daisy family , as they are supposed to be deer resistant i also have my deer repelling motion activated sprinkler turned on i want to plant many perennials as well , so they will continue to bloom every year i'm a haphazard gardener at best i learn as i go i find out what works and try to duplicate it but this i know the rules for planting are just like the rules of real estate location , location , location ! i'm excited about my soundclick page where there are now no less than songs for your downloading pleasure , a number i intend to increase to over the coming months i have such a backlog of compositions i 've never recorded seriously that i have a lot of pleasurable work ahead of me , though i need a bass guitar desperately to fill out the sound my fender bass is presently in the hands of my former bass player in oceanside , ca , and i do n't know how to get a hold of him the whales are still moving north here to their feeding grounds in the bering sea and below we saw them spouting this morning when it was calm i'm happy to report that my garden has a healthy population of earthworms after rototilling today , kathleen said and now you 've doubled them ! it was my younger brother 's birthday yesterday and i failed to call him , but he called me tonight to make up for it that is , before am so it was still his birthday i'm trying to think of a gift for him besides a cd or a book but it 's hard remember buying gifts for dad ? how he must have tired of ties and pens at least my girls always send me simpsons or lakers stuff as you can see , i have little to say tonight here 's my soundclick link again for free downloading of songs by dr c there are songs there on everything from organ donors to reggae doctors to conspiratorial flounders truly eclectic in substance and style i would n't have it any other way here 's an unpublished poem for my sign off back to sleep i went back to sleep and saw the scorched ruins of my philosophy begging for green wood though i would n't ax a sapling for my greater good i went back to sleep and saw the madonna of the tortilla in blue maize and white flour your time has come , she said though it was not my hour i went back to sleep and saw the present swallow the future as the past swallowed the present then woke with a start to the clock that said i was and i was n't thine at kilobunny , ce
