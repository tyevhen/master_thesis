this letter is a response to the post on december , dear a b thank you so much for replying so thoughtfully to my message your books have helped me so much my sister gave me her copy of brainswitch and i love it at first , when you wrote that i was probably very angry that my life was n't working out the way i wanted , i was taken aback i never think of myself as angry but i guess i am some things in life cannot be willed or forced like the big ones i want marriage and family and it definitely bothers me that it has come easily to friends and not to me i am really going to take your advice to heart i'm going to join a toast masters group because i am doing a toast at my sister 's wedding and i am going to take french classes so that i can pursue my dream of working in africa with doctors without borders and , i'm going to take art classes because i love art and miss it meanwhile , i'm just living minute by minute praying a lot , talking to my family a lot , being fully present and compassionate with my patients and planning to not spend much time alone until i feel better with some searching and being present , i hope my next step in life will be a good one thank you so much for your kindness and help t dear t , sounds like you are headed in a very positive direction a b curtiss
