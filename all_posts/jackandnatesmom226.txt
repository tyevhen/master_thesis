i will start by saying that i abhor that statement not because it 's untrue , but because of what it implies about the person you are speaking to that they are too naive to grasp what you are going through , unable to listen to what you have to say or offer any legitimate opinion about it i used to say this a lot when i was first a mother ahh , the good old days i had an argument with my little sister at one point about it and i can say i genuinely apologize i should know better i am a nurse i talk to and comfort people all day long who are in situations that are beyond anything that i 've ever experienced transplant patients ? parents of transplant patients ? this is who i talk to every day i do n't understand what they are going through how could i ? and my sister did n't understand what i was going through with two little kids and a full time job how could she ? understanding is n't everything empathy is i have heard from friends and family a few times that they are hesitant to talk about their problems around me anymore because they seem like nothing compared to what our family is going through bull pucky yes , problems are all relative , that is true , but that is of no importance to me if i love and care about someone , i want to know about their problems , i want to talk to them for god 's sake , i remember some of the stuff i used to get upset about it does seem minor now bad hair day , fat day ? people listened to me anyway the gravity of my issue was n't the point the support was i am well aware that although our family 's problems are significant , they are not earth shattering in the grand scheme of things my children are safe , we have a roof over our heads , we have jobs i guess i would hesitate before talking to a cancer patient about my boys for this reason but you know what ? i worked with cancer patients for quite a while , and they want to talk about something else besides cancer ! same goes for my transplant patients how many inquiries about my personal life do i demure to answer on a daily basis with my patients ? many everyone wants to think about someone else 's problems at times if nothing else , it takes their minds off their own i'm no different i have wonderful relationships with of my patients we joke , we laugh , they cry , i listen , and i love it i feel that i am very responsive to my patients' needs so when i got an angry voice mail today saying you do n't understand , stop judging me on and on i almost fell out of my chair i had bent over backwards for this person worked my butt off to help them obtain services that would not normally be available now it turned out that this person thought i was n't returning their calls when i was i was calling their old phone number , they had changed it without mentioning it to me easily cleared up but it left me shaken for some reason you do n't understand i do n't claim to understand , but i am committed to helping in any way that i reasonably can , and judgement does not and cannot come with this territory that goes for my friends and family too i know that those of you who are so supportive of us share this same view i get that you do n't fully understand how could you ? i hope you never , ever do ! but your empathy is priceless to our family , and i love each and every one of you so much for being there
