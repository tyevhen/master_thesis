the first time i experienced self injury was in the 's i was teaching a history course and one of my students was always using objects to carve on himself one day i noticed that he was using an eraser and rubbing it wildly on his skin after i called attention to his behavior , he amped it up a little more by taking a paper clip , carving various adjectives in his skin i cannot repeat them , and blowing ink into the bloody cuts i was horrified ! ! in those days there was little information for teachers about self harm so i truly thought he was just a disturbed kid and i limited my contact with him now fast forward seven years , i have my counseling degree and secured my first high school counseling gig suddenly , i went from viewing students from an instructional to a personal social perspective in my new position , i noticed a lot of kids who exhibited the same types of behaviors as my former student being curious , i knew that i needed to learn a lot more about more about this phenomenon ! as a school counselor , my first real case of working with a student who self injured was with a young girl who was known to cut the girl was rather open to me about her cutting and even exposed them to me red lines covered her arms , legs , and feet she told me the reason she cut herself was so that she would not take out her anger on her mom who had married a man she loathed i often suspected there was sexual abuse by her stepfather , but she never revealed that to me a year later , i had another young girl who was in a turbulent relationship with her boyfriend she was often kicked out of class and she would show up in my office crying and upset most days she would be able to pacify herself , but other days she tried to harm herself in my office by smashing her head on the table or the wall talk about stressful ! i would have to call her mother to come pick her up so she could go to her therapist the last situation i would like to share involved me talking to a former student who called me in the middle of the night to tell me that she was going to harm herself she told me that she had a razor , who she had named ernie , and that he was the only one that made her feel better while i had my daughter dial , i tried to persuade her to put ernie in another room while we spoke she told me years later that while we were talking she was cutting herself deeper and deeper this is truly chilling ! i could go on and on about the other cases that i have experienced as a school counselor , but i think it is important to know a little about why students self harm and what you need to do if you suspect or realize a student is involved in self injury the first time you experience a self injury situation it can be overwhelming as a school counselor , it is imperative that you receive training from an experienced therapist practitioner and gather great resources to help you work with these students a great website to use for resources and information
