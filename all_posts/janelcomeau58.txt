i love dystopian teen novels yes oh , yes the rest of the world is getting sick of the dystopian fantasy genre by now , but i still wake up every morning eager to read about teen angst , forced caste systems and cartoonishly sinister governments , mostly because i live in a mayonnaise white suburb with no post apocalyptic biker gangs to speak of , and the only corrupt authority figures are the officials down at city hall who make us pay by the bag for garbage pickup the crumbling ruins of a once great city are a welcome escape so when i heard about the divergent trilogy , i disregarded the mixed reviews i 'd heard and went out to get my hands on a copy of the books specifically this one if you have n't read the book and do n't want to know how it ends , turn back now yes , there are spoilers ahead without going into too much detail , the first two books were pretty good were they timeless literary masterpieces ? nope did i expect them to be ? of course not divergent and insurgent were exactly what i wanted easy to read entertainment with a cool world structure , some neat characters , and good old fashioned teen angst also noteworthy is the fact that the author , veronica roth , wrote the first book while on a school break in university , and picked up a movie deal at the same time as her degree at twenty five years old , she 's got a bestselling trilogy , millions of fans , a movie series and a bright future as a writer and that 's admirable but then there 's allegiant let 's back up a bit first the divergent trilogy takes place in a future , post apocalyptic chicago , where all the characters are the descendants of the survivors of an enormous war after the war , society divided into five 'factions' based on which human trait each group thought most necessary for preventing another war , because dividing into groups based on ideology has always been humanity 's most effective strategy for preventing war the five factions are abnegation , amity , candor , dauntless and erudite , and you can figure out which trait each faction prizes by looking those words up in the dictionary the protagonist , beatrice prior , lives in this faction system as an abnegation child all children live in their parents' faction until they are sixteen , when they take a hallucination based aptitude test that shows them which faction they 'truly' belong in they then go through a show of 'choosing' which faction they 'll live in for the rest of their lives they are not obligated to pick their aptitude test result , but if they do n't , they are essentially doomed to a life of misery surrounded by people they feel no connection with yay so , in essence , the entire world of divergent takes place in a giant , post apocalyptic high school then , of course , there are the divergent , who ca n't be placed in one category on the aptitude test among other vague , nebulous powers tris is divergent , but spends most of the series hiding that fact in her world , the divergent are hunted down and murdered just for existing so it 's nazi high school then in alligiant , tris is shocked to wander outside chicago and discover that her entire world was more or less a science experiment , and the only life she 'd known was a huge lie and that 's a perfectly fine way to end a story if you can pull it off right allegiant just fell short for me , for a couple of big reasons that 's not quite how genes work genetics come up a lot in science fiction and dystopia and why should n't they ? there are all sorts of interesting moral dilemmas that can be explored through the use of dna technology in novels aldous huxley 's brave new world explored the evils of genetic experimentation years before we 'd sequenced the human genome , and genetics based stories have been picking up steam ever since but with great science , comes a great responsibility to explain it correctly there 's a fantastic rule of thumb about using genetics in science fiction if the word 'genetics' in your story can be replaced with the word 'magic' or 'voodoo' without changing anything , you are using it wrong above a scientist optimizes a buffer solution for a polymerase chain reaction in allegiant , the word 'genetics' could be replaced with the word 'pepperoni' , and the story still would n't change see , in the third book , tris is finally given a gene based explanation for the factions , the divergent , and the structure of the only world she 's ever known hundreds of years ago , scientists took the human genome for a joy ride in an attempt to create superhumans with perfect personalities , and accidentally created a flawed race of violent people who , for some strange reason , did n't like being treated as damaged , second class subhumans and went to war with the 'unmodified' humans tris' world in chicago was set up after the war as a gigantic 'gene therapy' experiment that rounded up thousands of the defeated 'damaged' humans and attempted to fix their genes after a few generations of interbreeding , the scientists figured , the genetic damage would heal itself and healthy , 'divergent' people would be created because that 's how gene splicing works you 've gone too far , science let 's start with the biggest , most obvious problem you ca n't create healthy genes by interbreeding damaged ones it 'll never work i can highlight this with a real world example hemophilia is a hereditary blood disease that prevents the blood from clotting people with the disease can bleed to death from something as simple as a scraped knee , because it just does n't scab over the disorder is caused by a mutation or damage to the x chromosome , which is why you rarely see it in females since females have two copies of the x chromosome , their healthy copy takes over and they live normal lives , unaware that they carry a deadly disease in their genes when a male has the mutation , however , there is no backup x chromosome , and he experiences the full effects of the disorder now , chances are , most of the people reading this have never met a person with hemophilia , and they never will it 's rare to the point of being almost unheard of so what happens when you take a population of people with the hemophilia gene and have them interbreed for generations ? do you think their damaged genes heal themselves ? not according to the royal families of almost every european nation , whose inbreeding turned the rare disease into an uncontrollable epidemic that put an end to most of their bloodlines ask alexei romanov how that worked out for him another huge problem is that the faction system they 've set up is actually brilliantly designed to create more extreme behavioral problems , not more balanced individuals the people at the bureau allege that they are trying to breed more divergent people that is , people who do n't fit into the polarized faction system , and instead display a range of different strengths of character their actions say they 're trying to do just the opposite think about it each faction prizes its own characteristic trait above all else to the point that those individuals with the most extreme traits are held up as leaders and role models and the series acknowledges that there is some genetic basis to these traits it also shows us that there is zero interbreeding between members of different factions figuring out how biology plays out from there is n't exactly brain surgery it 's basic sexual selection the people in dauntless who show the most courage are going to be the most successful , and they 'll have the best chances of finding a similarly courageous mate the people who are least courageous will die , or at the very least , die alone with each passing generation , you 're going to get more and more extreme personalities , with more and more extreme genetic damage , until your entire faction has been bred with such flagrant disregard for personal safety that they all lemming off the hancock building and the same goes for all the other factions compounding this is the fact that the 'healthy' divergents all end up killed , homeless , or removed from the simulation if breeding extreme traits out of the population is the bureau 's goal , they literally could not have found a worse way to go about it people in the city will still die if she resets the bureau for those of you with no reading retention and those of you who have n't read the book , but do n't give one bedazzled fuck about spoilers , tris and tobias face a huge dilemma in the third book by this point in the story , there are three groups with competing interests who are starting to clash there 's the factionless , who want to see the faction system disbanded there are the allegiant , who want to see the faction system preserved and there is the bureau , who want the city of chicago to not be razed to the ground while its inhabitants murder each other evelyn , the leader of the factionless , decides halfway through the book that it 's her way or the highway , and she resolves to just murder the shit out of anyone who gets in her way effective problem solving ! the bureau ca n't allow half the population of chicago die in a senseless war , so they 're faced with a choice either shut the experiment down completely , debrief everyone involved , and set them up with 'normal' lives outside the city , or crop dust the inhabitants with a memory serum that will make them forget the war and quietly return to their faction lives they choose the latter tris and her friends have enough time and connections to get into the city and inoculate all of their loved ones against the serum so that they wo n't forget all about them when it hits but that 's not enough for tris oh , no she decides that making an entire population forget their lives is such an egregious , amoral act , she immediately turns around and tries to do the exact same thing to the bureau employees themselves because apparently , stealing someone 's memories and identities is wrong unless you personally approve of it that 's some jaden smith level philosophy right there so tris and tobias plan an elaborate and dangerous heist , in which they will prevent the gassing of chicago by stealing the serum and gassing the bureau instead but i think they 're forgetting something if chicago does n't get its memory reset , all the people they love are going to die in the war the reset was meant to prevent seriously with everyone at the bureau wandering around in a post amnesia daze , there will be no way to prevent evelyn and her army from swooping in and murdering joanne , cara , susan , and all the other people fighting against the factionless' tyranny in chicago their only plan to stop it is to put all their 'everyone not getting murdered' eggs in the same basket , and hope that tobias 's mother who feels so strongly about her cause that she literally faked her own death and left her son in the hands of an abusive monster will be suddenly overcome by a fit of maternal instict or memory serum because remember , destroying people 's memories is only wrong until tris decides it 's not if that desperate plan fails , tris and tobias will be forced to stand there and watch it all on the security monitors , powerless to stop it whoops is essence , tris is forced to make a choice between two evils on the one hand , yes , people will forget most of their lives they 'll go back to living in an orderly , misguided society , under new identities with heads full of false memories those with loved ones outside the city will be spared , and they will still remember everything from before the reset everyone else will forget everything including all the pain they 've experienced , the horrors they 've been through , the families they 've lost and the murders they were forced to commit they 'll get a chance to start over and forget all the traumas they 've been through but in tris' other choice , half of them will get gunned down by a crazy lady and her army of homeless people yeah , i 'd say tris chose wrong not everyone needs to die there are two reasons for an author to kill off a character plot or shock or because you 've cast sean bean to play him that works too killing off a character for plot usually manifests itself in one of two ways you might need that character to not be around for future events , or you might need to instill a personality change in a main character in the first case , it goes something like , we were counting on timmy to do x thing , but now he 's dead and we still need x thing done conflict ! ned stark up there is a great example he had vital information about joffrey 's parentage that he was going to spread around that information would have been really useful to a lot of people later in the books unfortunately , since ned is too dead to gossip , the plot has gone in a different direction in the second case , we get something like jim bob was always a passive person , but since timmy died in a grain thresher , he 's become angry and gluten free in other words , there is a tangible change in an important character because of the death think of sirius black from harry potter his death may have affected later events in the series , but the main reason for killing him off was to give harry more determination to succeed in both cases , the character 's death matters , and works to advance the story somehow sirius 's death also inspired the worst tribute haircut of all time if an author ca n't find a way to kill off a character for plot purposes , they do have something to fall back on shock in essence , you murder a character just to make the audience gasp and marvel at the heartless world you 've created bonus points if it 's a funny , beloved , gentle or otherwise likable character the story is n't really better for this character being dead the whole point is to get a knee jerk emotional reaction from the reader there were arguably a few deaths at the end of the harry potter series that only served to shock the reader the story was almost at the end , and rowling wanted to make sure you 'd been given a swift kick to the heart before it was over was this really necessary , j k rowling ? the thing about shock deaths is that they work really well once or twice maybe three times if you 're skilled the readers' hearts break , they grieve , and they grip the pages a little tighter as they read on , hoping that their remaining favourite characters wo n't meet the same fate if you need a way to make sure that your readers are good and attached to your characters , killing one of them tells the audience that 'hey , this is the kind of story where people die , and no one is safe better enjoy your beloved jim bob while you can , because there 's another grain thresher coming up in chapter and he might be next but , like novelty frozen yogurt shops and threesomes with former spice girls , there can be too much of a 'good' thing when you write a story where virtually every character is guaranteed a horrible death at some point , readers check out it 's a basic survival instinct why would anyone let themselves get attached to someone who is doomed to be shredded in a piece of farm equipment at some point or another ? people care about the first death in a story unless you 've crafted a once in a generation story like harry potter , no one cares about death incidentally , death in the harry potter series is mrs abbott , hannah abbott 's mother so , no , you probably did n't care and that 's one of the biggest problems with the divergent series , allegiant in particular everyone dies no , seriously take a look at this list of main characters from the books tris prior tobias eaton christina will al peter edward molly eric jeanine tori uriah lynn marlene shauna caleb andrew prior natlie prior marcus eaton evelyn johnson cara johanna david nita matthew look at that list notice anything ? most of those characters are dead the series ends with dead main characters and living ones that 's of the main cast deceased and of the characters who do live , one is crippled for life , one is wandering around in a haze of self induced amnesia , and the rest are doing their best to ward off their suicidal thoughts long enough to eke out empty lives in the shadows of all the people they 've lost and the problem is , i do n't care when al throws himself into the chasm in book one , that 's tragic he 's a scared , lost kid with an uncertain future who made a big mistake he could n't fix , and he succumbed to his despair sad will 's death is also heartbreaking he attacks tris while under mind control and she 's forced to fatally shoot him in self defense , an action that haunts her for the rest of her life very sad but by the time we hit allegiant , things start getting ridiculous in short , people die for the sole purpose of making the book dark tori is murdered in an ambush that is never really explained , just to prevent her from having a happy reunion with her long lost brother george uriah is killed for the crime of standing near a wall , just to make sure tobias breaks his promise to zeke in fact , uriah 's best friends , lynn and marlene , are killed for equally dubious reasons , making this the first book i 've ever seen that resolves a love triangle by murdering everyone involved in it in unrelated incidents and when the first person series switched to a new narrator in allegiant , i immediately figured that something terrible was looming for our protagonist yeah , you should look worried even the main character 's death was senseless she makes a noble sacrifice and survives impossible odds , only to be shot dead by a last second plot twist , all to prove some abstract point about love and selflessness she 's the last character to die in the books with the exception of david , who died an offscreen , veronica roth confirmed death from his injuries by the time she hits the ground , all of her friends are already dead it 's not shocking it 's not surprising it 's not even sad i 'd given up any attachment i 'd had to the characters long ago and just started flipping through the pages , waiting to see how the next one would bite the dust their deaths went from tragic to ordinary and if there 's one thing dystopia should n't be , it 's ordinary
