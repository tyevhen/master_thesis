the summer was just beginning when i last wrote here the days were hot , and i was very happy for that heat summer is always a season with weather i very much enjoy and now , the leaves are turning colour , the days are mostly cool , and the nights are downright cold a whole season has passed , and i find myself thinking that it went both very quickly , and at the same time quite slowly though it might be what you 're hoping for , this post is n't about unschooling or , at least it is n't about the philosophy of unschooling , simply my own attempts to follow what i'm truly passionate about , and make my way in the world a whole season without posts , and somewhat sporadic ones before that quite a few people have expressed disappointment at how little i 've been writing here , and a very small part of me feels bad i do n't like disappointing people but for the most part , i'm okay with it because honestly , i have to be open about how i'm just not that interested in education unschooling anymore not that i do n't still care about it , just that i do n't want it to be my main focus anymore this is n't a post to say this blog is ending , though i would definitely like to keep writing here , when i feel moved to , and there are a handful of draft posts i really do plan on finishing but i'm going to continue the recent trend of not writing here very often , for the simple reason that this is n't what 's calling to me , my mind is mostly taken up with something else that something else being , as you might have guessed if you follow me on twitter or are friends with me on facebook , food i love food as in , really , really love it going to farmers markets is one of my favorite outings , lovely vegetables make me skip with joy , cooking something new makes me giddy with excitement if i'm inside , there 's probably at least one cookbook within arms reach if i'm outside and not directly interacting with someone , i'm probably looking around spotting the edible plants i know , and wondering if the ones i do n't recognize are edible when i watch tv , it 's mostly food shows , and if my family had cable , i would probably skip sleeping and just watch the food network all night , every night instead i think you 're probably getting the picture i like growing food to , because plants are awesome i get food lest this seem sudden , i 've always really liked food , and enjoyed cooking for most of my teens years and even this more intense passion for food has been around probably two years now i guess what 's mainly changed , as silly as it sounds , is that i 've realized food can be my main focus for some reason , that did n't occur to me at first it makes me a bit sad to see that alternative freedom based ed has gotten pushed to the side , becoming only one of many interests hanging around at the sidelines of my life , but at the same time , it feels good what i really want to be focusing on right now , what i'm really interested in , is food firstly , and then radical sustainability , both of which overlap and fit together nicely it 's sad to realize that in many ways , an important phase in my life is over , but at the same time it feels so , so good to genuinely and truly know what i want to be doing i do n't feel like i'm floundering anymore i might still not know how to go about getting what i want , but now i know what i want ! so right now , i'm trying to get the experience and knowledge necessary to cook professionally , since i really want to be doing that i 've looked into culinary schools , but most are n't really what i'm looking for , and the couple that look interesting are very pricey besides , i'm not even really sure that route feels like the one i 'd like to take what i 'd really love to do is find some type of apprenticeship or internship type situation , with someone some restaurant into vegetarian or local sustainable food or possibly bread baking though i'm pretty flexible as long as it 's high quality cooking being done , and i do n't have to personally do butchering or deal with raw meat , i'm good an apprenticeship to me would be ideal ! so , you know , if any readers have any ideas on how to pursue that , i would be very , very grateful if you 'd share them ! when it comes to simply writing online , i think what feels best for me right now is to remain fairly quiet other than occasional posts on this blog i have considered starting a food themed blog , but i 've started so many failed blogs , i do n't just want to add another to the list , since i'm really not sure i 'd keep it up i am trying to write down recipes , and write about cool food related experiences , so maybe if i collect enough of those i 'll decide a blog might be in order we 'll see until then , i still post frequently , though now mostly about food , on twitter , and if enough people are interested in reading short food related updates , recipes , and food links , i could always start a facebook page devoted to that since i prefer to keep my private facebook page , where i do a fair bit of that , private ! i feel a need to thank all you readers for all the encouragement and support and enthusiasm you 've shared with me over the years i'm deeply , profoundly grateful for you all ! and i hope , as i make transitions in my life and follow new passions , that you 'll choose to stick around so we can continue to connect with each other , share experiences , and all that other stuff that 's made me so highly value blogging , and the other online communities i'm a part of ! with best wishes , idzie
