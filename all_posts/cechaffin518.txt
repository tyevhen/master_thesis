the next poem in the ascending mania of sine wave there 's something wrong with it that i discover below christ s lighthouse there is a pillar of light stuck in the rocks like excalibur above a harbor of heavy water heavy with suffering a hushed place where waves swallow their spray to dampen the mists that so easily obstruct your view i used to lose sight of it , thinking the ocean s furious slam dance the thing , me roped to the mast through the cold salt walls of death or ships would block it , horns and radios distract me until only a slip of light in the marbled sky recalled the jeweled foghorn , a dog whistle for the deaf do i dare now ? do i dare say i see it always , through sand storms and cell bars and self revulsion as if the great stone of the world were rolled away ? what terrible temptations do i then tempt ? what unexpected holy thing might then morph into evil , baiting my inner eye with self congratulation , me a blind man beating his dog with a white stick ? published in mindfire ir was n't until i got a fresh , clean look at this poem that i noticed what had always been wrong with it all i have to do to make it worthy is eliminate the entire first stanza and let the title work harder observe christ 's lighthouse i used to lose sight of it , thinking the ocean s furious slam dance the thing , me roped to the mast through the cold salt walls of death or ships would block it , horns and radios distract me until only a slip of light in the marbled sky recalled the jeweled foghorn like a dog whistle for the deaf do i dare now ? do i dare say i see it always , through sand storms and cell bars and self revulsion as if the great stone of the world were rolled away ? what terrible temptations do i then tempt ? what unexpected holy thing might then morph into evil , baiting my inner eye with self congratulation , me a blind man beating his dog with a white stick ? tell me it is n't a better poem now it 's always the same process for me over a number of years i finally discover the poem within the poem we really must jettison every irrelevant word in a poetic narrative and choose the right details to convey the spirit of the poem there is only one method i know to produce such quality revisions separated by long periods of time , often years i think my first draft of this poem was in early four years it took me to see i did n't need the first stanza why ? because my mind was n't elastic enough to think of jettisoning a whole stanza one can be much more dispassionate about the editing process in proportion to how old the poem is if the poem has arrived , all your new revisions will only weaken it if it has n't arrived , your revisions deletions mainly ! will pare it down to the essentials and make it a better poem , a poem with good bones as my dear wife likes to say here 's a brief abstract of the poem for those not used to what poets inflict on the reader precis here the speaker strives to imagine his connection to god as unassailable while doubting himself at the same time , so he ends up punishing himself for the presumption of his own faith a blind man beating his dog with a stick he is the blind man and the dog for fear of owning his faith in his faith looking back on this poem , it more resembles a mixed state than mania , as the energy is essentially negative holding at kilorats , ce
