i thought it was worth mentioning that this is the th post published on this blog yay ! when i started it at the beginning of the summer , i wanted to write here every single day well , that idea got scrapped pretty fast , but i have managed to write regularly ! to be honest , i do n't think i 've ever managed to keep a blog or a personal journal going for this long that makes me happy so , in other more interesting news , halloween was awesome ! i did n't end up celebrating samhain , because with the people i was with , and the mood they were in , it simply would not have worked what we did do we being eight or nine of us , all locals was walk around trick or treating well , most of us trick or treated myself and one and a half others did n't trick or treat , feeling we were too old , hang out at a pick nick bench cheerfully making fun of each other do n't worry , no one ever gets offended or we would n't do it , then chill in one friends garages for a while 'chilling' involved having huge candy wars , causing more than a few bruises lollipops hurt when they hit you ! , filling one unlucky person who was being antisocial inside 's shoes with candy wrappers , and snorting a candy called crack up when they saw that name , the guys just could n't resist rolls eyes oh , and i took lots of pictures and videos when the candy wars got boring , and the garage too stuffy , we all spilled outside to run around in the beautiful windy night , and cuddle in my cloak when the wind got cold good times my sister and i got home past a m the next day was spent recovering ! in the days since halloween , i 've honestly been rather lazy i 've been goofing off on the computer , reading , thinking it 's been grey outside , and grey days tend to drain me i had n't read any novels in monthes , but in the last week i finished three ! i know there was something more i wanted to write about something just a little profound but it 's grey out , my mind feels slow , and i want to just curl up in a corner and read so i 'll go do that for now or do something equally non active and if i think of any more words to write , there will be another post today for now , i leave you with some halloween pic 's peace idzie believe it or not , there 's someone swinging on that but with my camera 's night settings , they blur so much they 're simply the faintest of shadows
