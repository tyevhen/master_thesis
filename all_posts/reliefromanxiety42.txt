where is it correct to draw the line ? i 've always wondered if shyness is somewhere on the spectrum of anxiety , but i'm not a psychologist so i'm not sure of the full answer i 've always found it strange that different people can be shy because of different things i have often heard that actors and actresses are shy when off stage , but are in their element on stage this is definitely something i cannot relate to ! my earliest memory of my shyness is when i was made to be mary in the infant school play , with the teachers hoping that it would improve my confidence it certainly did n't ! i guess i have always been a shy person as i 've hated being the centre of attention , never really put my hand up in class and hated being on stage , but i wonder whether this was anxiety all along perhaps i had been suffering from anxiety from the age of five , but there 's not much that can tell this is the case i suppose it almost seems like over the years , my shyness developed into an anxiety disorder with panic attacks and how disabling it became and i think this is where the line is drawn when it becomes that debilitating when my anxiety was at its worst , i could n't do anything but as it improved i began to learn situations that i was more comfortable in , almost like the situations where my shyness affected me less i think it 's possible to say that there is a connection , but i certainly think that anxiety is the more severe , and i 'll just take this opportunity to remind you that if you feel you are suffering with anxiety that is getting in the way or your everyday life , then please seek help i know it 's scary and a lot of the time i hear people saying that they think it 's nothing , but even if it is , it 's better to sure if you feel that the opinion the doctor gives you in the first instance is n't right , then i encourage you to go and see someone different until you see someone who understands what is going on with your mind and body remember , you know you the best i'm curious , has anyone else experienced shyness and anxiety ? what are your stories ? leave me a comment below best wishes , amy xx
