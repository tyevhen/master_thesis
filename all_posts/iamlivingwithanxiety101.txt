i feel stuck i'm highly motivated to live a less anxious life , and i'm taking steps to do so seeing a counselor , using flashcards , writing this blog yet my anxiety is not decreasing as rapidly as i would like i want anxiety to stop now , and i want to feel better immediately however , i must remember that these problems did n't develop overnight , and they 're not going to disappear that quickly either overcoming anxiety is a day by day journey , and every step down the path to a less anxious life puts me another foot closer to that goal
