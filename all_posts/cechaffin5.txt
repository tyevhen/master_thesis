my mood is mildly improved , it seems , with the addition of wellbutrin to the soup now my dilemma is what to do with myself i have been withdrawing from the world for a year and a half and have lost contact with so many , been unable to write verse and unwilling to play music on disability i am not allowed to work at a job , and i am physically limited by my chronic back pain for starters i think i shall try to weed the garden a little each day and continue my daily walks i feel like an yr old man inside a yr old body truly , i ache everywhere , esp from deconditioning , i think , despite my walking today i am afflicted with severe sciatica and can barely sit to write this oh this mortal coil ! why must it demand so much of us and why is pain so much part of the bargain kathleen told me about experiments in which the brain re interprets pain as pleasurable good luck ce
