i think i re tore my right hip labrum i was moving a patient at work last week when my right hip popped very familiar pain and aching in my groin and thigh followed i prayed and prayed and prayed it would n't be true , but i'm afraid my prayers went unanswered if torn , this would be the third time two surgeries had it fixed , until last week , but i'm not sure three is an option i'm not sure i want another surgery even if it is an option it took about months to fully recover from the last one in fact , it 's only been in the last months that i 've felt back at full strength unfortunately , the only way to thwart the pain is to resect the tear i e surgery so if it is an option , i 'll have to take it if it 's not an option , i 'll be in almost constant discomfort and sometimes pain there is nothing positive here both possibilities feel ominous and unwanted sitting here worrying about these potential outcomes is not helpful it does n't change a thing i 'd like to go back in time and change how i moved a week ago simply repositioning my foot would have avoided the re injury i know that now i was n't thinking about it then there is nothing i can do to change my current reality , and that 's difficult to accept i'm frustrated and disappointed feeling defeated i do n't want to be sitting here in pain i do n't want to have to deal with this all over again but i am , and i do and i'm working on accepting it
