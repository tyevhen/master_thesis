last week i sent out the kennedy s disease association s annual report as in past years , it always amazes me how much can be accomplished by an all volunteer non profit in one year at the same time i consider how much more could be done with more volunteers i have never been a proponent of hiring an office staff or paying a commission to telephone solicitors i hate those canned phone calls and all the mailings that include small giveaways in hopes of enticing you to give yet , it would be nice to have more feet on the ground that are focused on the kda s work we do so much good with so few resources it still amazes me that of every dollar spent by the kda goes to kennedy s disease research and kennedy s disease education when i review the financial reports of some of the larger non profits , i cannot believe how much is spent on salaries , overhead and fund raising on the other hand , most of these larger non profits seem to be quite effective in raising needed funds i don t know how much longer i will serve as president of the kda , but i do know that these last seven years have been some of the most rewarding years of my life i have made many friends and shared many stories i have helped some people and have been helped by so many more in some ways it reminds me of the concept pay it forward today s article is a long winded way of saying thank you to all of your who have donated your time and or money to make the kennedy s disease association so effective without you there would be no kda
