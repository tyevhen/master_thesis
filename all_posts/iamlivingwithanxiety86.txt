i 've decided to try an in person support group finding one has not been easy , and i live in a large city i have n't found one specifically for generalized anxiety disorder , so i am going to try a recovery , inc , group , which helps people with all sorts of mental problems they have a lot of active groups in my area , such as this one if you 've had any experience with this organization , i 'd love to hear about it i did look into emotions anonymous , but it is too spiritually based for me finally , i did apply for compeer , a mentoring program , but my local chapter is very slow at responding to inquiries and completely ignored one of my relatives so finding offline support has not been easy , but i hope it 's worth it
