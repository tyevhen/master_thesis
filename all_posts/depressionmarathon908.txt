i am dragging it took forever for me to wake up for work this morning then i had a long , heavy day now it 's only pm , and i can barely keep my eyes open , and i just woke up from a nap ! i fell asleep right after i got home from work i'm not sure why i'm so tired it 's just one of those days , i guess i was hoping to go for a short swim tonight , but there 's no way that 's going to happen perhaps i 'll just go to bed tomorrow , i'm planning a short run ! hopefully i 'll wake up by then ! no word from the vet yet regarding puck 's biopsy keep him in your prayers ! we 're supposed to have a blizzard tomorrow ! but then again , are the weathermen ever correct ? i 'll leave you with this i found it in my aa book i'm not sure where i got it from , but i like it hope you do to when we are in ourselves , thinking only about ourselves , it 's like a chunk of chocolate sitting in the bottom of a glass of milk but if we get out of ourselves and spend time giving to others , that chocolate gets stirred up , and we end up with a beautiful glass of chocolate milk
