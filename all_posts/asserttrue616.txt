i keep running into situations in user interfaces for well known products where the cancel button is misused a typical scenario involves a configuration dialog , one that perhaps has several tabs because there are so many configuration options , you might spend several minutes on this one dialog , checking checkboxes and entering string values when you 're done , you look for a done button and find none is there a finish button , perhaps ? no an accept these settings button ? no just a cancel button do you see what 's wrong with this picture ? cancel does not mean done it does not mean i'm finished now , so accept my changes and save my work and dismiss this dialog let 's be clear , cancel means or should mean one thing only let me back out of the current operation as if nothing had happened ui designers , take note please do n't make me use cancel to get out of a dialog after i know i 've just made important changes to the state of the program
