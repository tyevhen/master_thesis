i am just back from a good treadmill run at my gym although my left knee continues to bother , the pain is much improved on thursday , after applying kinesiotape , i was able to run , minute segments with one minute walk breaks i iced it down immediately following that run , and i recovered nicely yesterday i rode my recumbent , stationary bike without difficulty , so i decided to try a bit more challenging run today this morning i ran , minute segments with one minute walk breaks for a total of miles , and i felt good my knee was a little sore , but i was able to run without altering my gait i'm hopeful i am on the mend if i recover well today , without any increased soreness , i will try a longer , slow run outside tomorrow we 're finally going to be out of the deep freeze tomorrow , so it will be nice to spend time outdoors with jet it 's sunny and crisp today , but too cold to spend much time outside by the way , my mood continues to be sunny , too i feel better and better everyday the darkness of january has n't been forgotten , but it 's getting further and further from my mind i'm enjoying the freedom of feeling well i have enough energy to work , exercise , get to my meetings , and even socialize a bit i feel like i'm mentally and physically mending it 's nice i'm grateful to be back living , not just surviving , life
