yesterday i was talking about wanting as , perhaps , the antithesis of despair this morning i had only a tinge of depression kind of like a stain left over from yesterday which hid in the brain shadows and ventured out zap ! it was easily dispelled with a moment or two of , , , who are we for exercise then , before i got up , i lay in bed a few minutes and thought a bit about wanting maybe it was , indeed , a possible mood changer to think about wanting something then i realized that it was important to want something you already have , rather than wanting something you do n't have wanting something you do n't have is a bit stressful wanting , or desire , as a kind of fear to get you going is a bit different it 's okay to want something you do n't have in order to put a fire under yourself to strive to do better to attains your goal and it 's good to have goals but wanting what you already have is a gratitude that puts you in a nice place to start the day and would n't be a bad thing to think about more often
