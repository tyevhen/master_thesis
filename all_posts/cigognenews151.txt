kr yes we 're gong to wrap it up , but i want to say something here , most of us to greater or lesser degrees have been wounded , have been traumatized , either a little or not such a little , and we pay the consequences of this , and there 's really not much that can be done about it in our short of undertaking a very difficult therapy , which some people do but most people in practical terms cannot like many people , i had a difficult birth , and i knew who my mother was and she smoked cigarettes and she had an unhappy marriage , and i know that i have suffered my whole life from the life i spent inside my mother and as a consequence of the reality of my family that i was born into , and i just want to say that even though i joined the of humanity who suffers from difficult life circumstances , just understanding how all this works and understanding that there are reasons that we are anxious , or depressed , or strange or tormented to different degrees in different ways i probably could be saying this in a lot better way but i'm kind of just blurting it out i'm just making the case that just knowing this or understanding it is very helpful and that is just my testimony and it helps me a lot to understand who i am and how i got this way , and the plusses and minuses of living and ordinary life as a human being in the th century in the st century i just wanted to say that jl yes , i think you said it splendidly , i think what this book does is forces you to sort of look at yourself , and look at yourself differently and really start to think back to those earliest experiences and your mother 's pregnancy and think about how you are as a person what your personality what is derived from and who you are as a result of very early experiences , and i think that 's a very illuminating and also , i think in a sense curative experience , just knowing , just having that knowledge allows you to better understand yourself and kind of who you are kr yes , my mother was anesthetized at my birth , i was anesthetized and i'm a mess i 've been a mess my whole life jl but , again , i think as dr janov writes , we did n't know a lot of things fifty years ago , and behaved the way we did because of the knowledge we had at the time , what was available and i think one of his points is that , that knowledge is different now , we know different things , so we have to start to chart a new course for psychotherapy and a new course for the whole practice of pregnancy , and how we treat pregnant women and help them have the healthiest birth experience they can kr we can do much better going forward and we can give our new children and their new children much better lives that s pretty great ! jl that s the hopeful way , i think to end , for sure ! kr i really thank you so much for coming and talking to us jl i appreciate it , it was really a true pleasure and hopefully i ll hear from you again soon kr hopefully we did a descent job serving dr janov s heroic work jl yes , i think you did , and i appreciate you sharing your own experience kr all right , we ll talk again , thank you , thank you thank you jeff link , chicago illinois , the editor of life before birth i m sorry i don t have the book , how our womb life rules the rest of our lives , like it or not , that s not the subtitle , but like it or not , what can you do ? it s hard , it s painful , it s horrible , and there it is , what can you do ? you might as well eat it you re going to eat it anyway , and eating it is ok if we were going to live forever , then we d really be screwed up , forever but , we re just here for a few decades , and if we can move this thing along , if we can provide our children with a much better head start a much better prognosis for a relatively pain free life , or a relatively trauma free life , this is stupendous achievement , and something to be very excited about and proud of , i think , and i hope you do too , and i hope that you ll investigate dr janov s work new book is called life before birth , and you know that s what we re here for , we re here to improve if we do have a future while we re here , we might as well make it a better future for our family it ain t about us as individuals , it s about us as a family among other families , among all other families i hope we re getting this , thank you for listening that was jeff link , the editor of life before birth , by arthur janov
