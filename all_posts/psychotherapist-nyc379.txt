in a prior blog article , common myths about psychotherapy therapy takes a long time , i addressed one of the biggest misperceptions about therapy that has lingered for many years in my current article , i 'll address another common myth , namely , that if a person goes to therapy , it means that he or she is a weak person common myths about psychotherapy going to therapy means you 're weak in the united states , we live in a society where rugged individualism is admired and encouraged in many areas the idea of picking yourself up by your bootstraps is also admirable to many people and while there is much to admire about people who overcome adversity , it 's also true that if any of us is put through enough stress , we will need help and emotional support to get through it for people who seek psychological help in therapy , it 's not a sign of weakness rather , it 's a sign of strength and courage to seek help , especially when we live in a culture that often does n't encourage reaching out for psychological help the following vignette , which is a composite of many cases with all identifying information changed , illustrates what i'm talking about john john grew up in a small town where everyone knew each other and family friendships often went back generations his family struggled financially , especially when his father lost his job and , even though the family was entitled to public assistance to help them through the tough financial times , his parents adamantly refused to apply for it his father said he did n't believe in it , and he felt that each family should make their own way rather than relying on , from his perspective , handouts during the lean times , john and his sister , betty , knew better than to complain they watched their parents maintain a stoic attitude and they took their cue from them his parents never talked about their feelings , and john saw little in the way of affection between them so , john learned to keep his feelings to himself and he never wanted to bother anyone with his problems even as a young child , who felt lonely much of the time because his parents would n't allow friends to come over , john did n't complain whenever john 's father heard anyone talking about feeling sad or anxious , he would just shake his head and say that , personally , he did n't have time to think about how sad or anxious he might feel , and he considered complaining about it to be a luxury years later , after john graduated college and moved out to nyc to settle into a career , he felt guilty and self indulgent whenever he realized that he felt sad , lonely or anxious instead of focusing on his emotions , he just worked harder and tried to forget about his feelings but when he began developing physical problems , including back pain , headaches and gastrointestinal problems and he went to see his medical doctor , his doctor told him that he could n't find a medical cause for john 's physical problems , and he recommended that john see a psychotherapist john was shocked to hear his doctor tell him that there were probably underlying psychological issues involved with his medical problems so then , his doctor explained the mind body connection to john to help john understand that his body was taking the toll for his unexamined and unresolved emotional problems no one in john 's family would ever think of seeing a psychotherapist , so he felt ashamed and weak for not being able to handle his problems on his own , especially as a man he shuttered to think what his parents , especially his father , would think if they knew that he set up a consultation with a psychotherapist he knew , even if they did n't say it out loud , that they would think he was weak over time , john learned in therapy how hard he was being on himself and that his rigid views about what people should and should n't do were getting in his way and creating more problems for himself he also discovered that an experienced psychotherapist could help him to access his own strengths in ways that he could n't do on his own common myths about psychotherapy going to therapy means you 're weak it took a while before john was able to feel that it actually takes courage to get help in therapy as he worked through his emotional problems , his medical symptoms were alleviated and he realized that his unresolved emotional issues had turned into medical problems because he was n't dealing with them in the past but now that he was dealing with them directly , he also no longer felt sad or anxious , and he did n't feel lonely because he was learning new and effective ways to relate to people , so he was making friends distorted perceptions about being weak are often deeply ingrained one
