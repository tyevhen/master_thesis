it 's been a rough couple of days here my back appears to be healing , at least in the area of l where the surgery was performed , however i now have increased pain a few vertebrae below l it is significant pain , too it hurts just to the left of approximately s , the uppermost vertebra of the sacrum it 's been difficult to find a comfortable position , and the pain is waking me several times a night i called my surgeon 's office yesterday the nurse i spoke with assured me it was likely pain related to my surgery and encouraged me to be more consistent with taking my pain medication i hope she 's correct , but i fear she is n't i'm pretty sure this pain is not related to my surgery i think it 's part of the original injury but at a different vertebral level i complained about this pain a few days prior to my surgery , which is when it first presented itself , and was told it was likely referred pain from my l injury i was hopeful they were correct then , too , but i do n't think they are this pain feels different and acts differently despite my concerns , i did as told yesterday i took my pain pill every four hours as prescribed it did n't seem to make a difference now it 's the weekend , and i hurt i'm doing what i can to relieve the pain and remain as active as possible , within the limits of my post operative restrictions , of course i'm taking my pain med regularly , icing my back , walking half a block , and strengthening my left leg as best i can i really hope this pain subsides , as my surgical team assures me it will , but i remain dubious i'm already anticipating i 'll be on the phone with them first thing monday morning i just hope they listen
