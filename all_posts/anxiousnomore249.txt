photo by tibbly this morning i woke up and again i felt defeated without even getting out of bed i thought things like , here we go again another day of struggling i do n't want to deal with this today this is so hard i get out of bed with this horrible attitude of self defeat , sometimes not even realizing it , it sometimes is just a feeling in my stomach that puts me in a negative frame of mind i really want to work on this because it does set the mood for my day and makes it so much harder to stay positive and not fall into the role of the victim all along i have been thinking that i am not really effected very much by the negative self talk of the victim , but i am realizing that this self defeating attitude i face in the mornings really is the victim creeping into my life and ruining my confidence , self respect and motivation so i need to stop sabotaging my recovery i need to stop acting like i am a victim of circumstances , and realize the affirmation i tell myself all the time i am in control of my life i need to start the day with more positive thinking the first step is to get rid of the idea that its definitely going to be a hard or bad day i do n't know if it will be a hard day or not , but telling myself that will make it hard so if i wake up feeling bad i should say to myself this might be hard today , but i can handle it i can do this i want to become master of my mind and not a victim of it so heres my challenge to myself the next day i wake up feeling scared , hopeless , or annoyed about having to start the process all over , i am going to try to remember to think of any of these positive affirmations instead found at www bmindful com i am strong i can do this i can accomplish anything i set my mind to i break the end vision into achievable chunks every day , i make at least one step that takes me closer to my goals i am confident , competent and calm i am a motivated person i have the power to control my health i am in control of my health and wellness i do not fear being unhealthy because i know that i control my own body i am creating healing energy in my life my thoughts are under my control i am taking care of my mental health every day maybe i will write one out on a note card and put it on my nightstand or on the bathroom mirror or in my closet so i can see it when i wake up also , i am trying really hard this week to do yoga everyday if possible , and to eat something for every meal even if its a small something , i do n't want to get into the habit of skipping meals altogether also i am trying to follow the good advice of my sister make every bite count so if i can only eat a little something , it will be packed with calories and be very nutritious so far , so good the following is an excerpt from the book the anxiety and phobia workbook fourth edition i did n't list the whole passage but enough of it to remind me about how i am in control of my life and can choose to feel fear or replace it with peace focusing on a fear always makes it worse i can change my focus to loving , supportive constructive ideas i ca n't make fearful thoughts go away struggling with them only makes them loom larger instead i can redirect my mind to more peaceful calming thoughts and circumstances every time i do this i am choosing peace instead of fear the more i choose peace , the more it becomes a part of my life with practice i get better at redirecting my mind i learn how to spend less time focusing on fear i grow stronger in my ability to choose wholesome , helpful thoughts over fearful ones i make time to relax to reconnect with that place deep within myself that is always at peace when i make time to do this , i can choose to move away from fearful thoughts i can allow my mind to expand into a wider place that is much larger than my fearful thoughts when i relax or meditate my mind becomes deep enough to transcend fear i'm learning to see that my fearful thought grossly overestimate risk or threat the true risk i face in most situations is actually very small true its impossible to eliminate risk from life altogether i'm learning to recognize my tendency to exaggerate risk , to blow them out of proportion every fear involves both overestimating the threat of danger and underestimating my ability to cope the important thing is not to feed fear not to dwell on it or give it energy i no longer want to feed my fear or my victim within only my tummy
