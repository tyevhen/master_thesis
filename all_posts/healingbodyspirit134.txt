life is what happens while you are having a pity party eagles soar , tulips bloom , rainbows radiate colors , babes are born , birds hatch eggs couples become engaged , women window shop , doctors save lives , miracles happen , people sing in church , children pray , choirs praise our lord , mother 's wipe tears , a toddler 's first steps , the poor are fed , hearts are filled with love , mother nature kisses the earth , streams ripple over rocks , and ocean waves glide across white sands with so much going on , is there really time to have a pity party ?
