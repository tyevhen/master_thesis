today i am sick with the flu at first it felt as if my stomach was in the clutches of an angry dragon , but soon i just felt blah all over i'm so glad i got my flu shot last week ! yes , indeed it may not have worked at all , but at least i got out of the house , got to meet new people , got jabbed in the arm for no reason , and then got the flu anyway it really could n't have turned out any better i also got a pneumonia shot , but it felt like i had been stabbed with a pencil then my arm ballooned and turned cherry red boy , that was a lot of fun i bet i 'll get pneumonia again , too it 's been a year since it nearly killed me before if i'm lucky i can get the flu and pneumonia at the same time again then i 'll really be living it up so while i try to mend my illness with sarcasm , and since i wo n't be writing the blog i had planned on for today , i wanted to share something with you that i 've been experimenting with i post a lot of mental health links on twitter , but not everyone has a twitter account so i 've been playing around with flipboard this month to make a constantly updating magazine featuring those links there were n't any mental health resources on flipbaord , so i thought this would be a worthwhile experiment considering how few people facebook allows to see what i post on my page over there , i ca n't imagine fewer people will see this magazine a splintered mind on flipboard although flipboard was originally an ipad app , and is now available for android tablets , the creators of flipboard have made flipboard magazines available to the general web click on the link and let me know what you think then bookmark it i 'll be adding new content to it weekly you might also like what do i have in common with the top adhd blogs ? adhd depression distraction as therapy cookie time adhd distractions as therapy disability bloggers you probably did n't know about linkwithin
