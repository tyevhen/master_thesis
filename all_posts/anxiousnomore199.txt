photo by illustriousbean lately i have been feeling a little bummed out for really no apparent reason at all i had a rough work day with excruciatingly long meetings and i know that the rest of the work week will require some extensive overtime so i guess thats a reason i got home and started cleaning my house but lost interest and energy after a little while now i feel really grumpy and ca n't really explain it maybe its the last days of summer flying past me with the heat thats causing me to feel so lazy and sad maybe its just a bad rut but i ca n't really focus enough to write a really decent post so i just decided to write how i feel i am starting to not like going to my church for the simple fact that everyone has children except me so i sit there and all i can think about is how many people have babies and little children and why ca n't it be so easy for me ? it makes me feel defected in a way but i know i just need to put my trust in god and he will support me in my trials he knows better than i do when i should go that route plus the other benefits i get by going to church always outweigh the comparing thoughts i can never escape comparing myself thats not to say i only want kids cause everyone else does because i have already gone a lot longer than most couples that live near me without kids and for a long time i was proud of that fact but now i see a baby and its more of how i want one also i acted like a huge know it all and started a little family drama that is too draining to even get into so i have a sister that wo n't return my calls and she is getting married in a month and i do n't know if she even wants me to come so life is n't super fun right now so maybe the grumpiness is n't without reason and thats ok it ca n't always be great if the clouds never came than i would never appreciate the sun in other news , i 've been asked to be a guest blogger on another anxiety blog if there is any suggestions on what you want to read about , let me know its not as comfortable trying to post on someone else 's blog as opposed to my own maybe there is such a thing as social anxiety via blogging ? p s i added a song speeding cars by imogen heap to the playlist , its one of my all time favorites that i was finally able to find if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety you might also like my story what to do when feeling overwhelmed they 're here looks like someone s got a case of the mondays linkwithin
