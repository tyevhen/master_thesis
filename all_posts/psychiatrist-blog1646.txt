i had a hard time tracking some of this stuff down , so thought i 'd put it up here to make it easier below is the transcription of the introduction of sb in the senate on feb , with more from aug at the end by mr domenici for himself , mr kennedy , mr enzi , mr brown , mr smith , mr feingold , mr coleman , mr lautenberg , mr warner , mrs boxer , ms murkowski , mr akaka , mr roberts , mr cardin , mr hatch , ms cantwell , ms collins , ms stabenow , ms snowe , mr biden , mr graham , and mr nelson of nebraska s a bill to provide parity between health insurance coverage of mental health benefits and benefits for medical and surgical services to the committee on health , education , labor , and pensions mr kennedy access to mental health services is one of the most important and most neglected civil rights issues facing the nation for too long , persons living with mental disorders have suffered discriminatory treatment at all levels of society they have been forced to pay more for the services they need and to worry about their job security if their employer finds out about their condition sadly , in america today , patients with biochemical problems in their liver are treated with better care and greater compassion than patients with biochemical problems in their brain that kind of discrimination must end no one questions the need for affordable treatment of physical illnesses but those who suffer from mental illnesses face serious barriers in obtaining the care they need at a cost they can afford like those suffering from physical illnesses , persons with mental disorders deserve the opportunity for quality care the failure to obtain treatment can mean years of shattered dreams and unfulfilled potential eleven years ago , congress passed the first mental health parity act that legislation was an important first step in bringing attention to discriminatory practices against the mentally ill , but it did little to correct the injustices that so many americans continue to face the legislation required that annual and lifetime dollar limits for mental health coverage must be no less than the limits for medical and surgical coverage but more steps are clearly needed to guarantee that americans suffering from mental illness are not forced to pay more for the services they need , do not face harsher limitations on treatment , and are not denied access to care this bill is a chance to take the actions needed to end the longstanding discrimination against persons with mental illness the late senator paul wellstone and senator pete domenici deserve great credit for their bipartisan leadership on mental health parity if it were not for them , we would not be here today the bill prohibits group health plans from imposing treatment limitations or financial requirements on the coverage of mental health conditions that do not also apply to physical conditions that means no limits on days or treatment visits , and no exorbitant co payments or deductibles the bill was negotiated by and has the support of the mental health community , the business community , and the insurance industry the need is clear one in five americans will suffer some form of mental illness this year but only a third of them will receive treatment millions of our fellow citizens are unnecessarily enduring the pain and sadness of seeing a family member , friend , or loved one suffer illnesses that seize the mind and break the spirit battling mental illness is itself a painful process , but discrimination against persons with such illnesses is especially cruel , since the success rates for treatment often equal or surpass those for physical conditions according to the national institute of mental health , clinical depression treatment can be percent successful , and treatment for schizophrenia can be percent successful over the years we 've heard compelling testimony from experts , activists , and patients about the need to equalize coverage of physical and mental illnesses the office of personnel management talks us that providing full parity to million federal employees has led to minimal premium increases we heard dramatic testimony about the economic and social advantages of parity , including a healthier , more productive workforce some of the most compelling testimony came several years ago from lisa cohen , a hardworking american from new jersey , who suffers from both physical and mental illnesses , and is forced to pay exorbitant costs for treating her mental disorder , while paying little for her physical disorder she is typical of millions of americans who not only face the cruel burden of mental illness , but also the cruel burden of discriminatory treatment no americans should be denied equal treatment of an illness because it starts in the brain instead of the heart , lungs , or other parts of their body no patients should be denied access to the treatment that can cure their illness because of where they live or work a number of states have already enacted mental health parity laws , but million workers under erisa have no protection under state mental health statutes mental health parity is a good investment for the nation the costs from lost worker productivity and extra physical care outweigh the costs of implementing parity for mental health treatment over the years study after study has shown that parity makes good financial sense an analysis of more than , workers at major companies showed that employees who report being depressed or under stress are likely to have substantially higher health costs than co workers without such conditions employees who reported being depressed had health bills percent higher than those who did not suffer from depression those reporting high stress had percent higher health costs mcdonnell douglas found a to return on investment after accounting for lower medical claims , reduced absenteeism , and smaller turnover mental illness also imposes a huge financial burden on the nation it costs us billion each year in treatment expenses , lost worker productivity , and crime this country can afford mental health parity what we ca n't afford is to continue denying persons with mental disorders the care they need today is a turning point we are finally moving toward ending this shameful form of discrimination in our society discrimination against mental illness this bill has been seven years in the making , and brings first class medicine to millions of americans who have been second class patients for too long today , we begin to right that wrong , by guaranteeing equal treatment to the million people receiving mental health services , and promising equal treatment to the remaining million insured workers and their families who never know the day they may need their mental health benefit the act , was an important step towards ending health insurance discrimination against mental illness this bill will take another large step forward by closing the loopholes that remain it guarantees co payments , deductibles , coinsurance , out of pocket expenses and annual and lifetime limits that apply to mental health benefits are no different than those applied to medical and surgical benefits it guarantees that the frequency of treatment , number of visits , days of coverage and other limits on scope and duration of treatment for mental health services are no different than those applied to medical and surgical benefits this equal treatment and financial equity is also applied to substance abuse features of state law that require coverage of mental disorders are protected , to assure those currently protected by state parity laws that their needs will be met the medical management strategies needed to prevent denial of medically needed services for patients remain intact finally , the bill is modeled on the parity that is already guaranteed to the million persons , including members of congress , under the federal employee benefits program , equal treatment of those affected by mental illness is not just an insurance issue it 's a civil rights issue at its heart , mental health parity is a question of simple justice it is long past time to end insurance discrimination and guarantee all people with mental illness the coverage they deserve i urge my colleagues to support this important principle , and end the unacceptable double standards that have unfairly plagued our health care systems for so long mr domenici mr president , i rise today along with my colleagues senator kennedy and senator enzi to introduce the mental health parity act of i want to thank my colleagues for all of their hard work on this issue and i am glad we are able to introduce this paramount legislation simply put , our legislation will provide parity between mental health coverage and medical and surgical coverage no longer will people be treated differently only because they suffer from a mental illness this means million people in group health plans will benefit from our bill we are here today after years of hard work we have worked with the mental health community , the business community , and insurance groups to carefully construct a fair bill a sampling of the groups include the national alliance on mental illness , the american psychological association , the american psychiatric association , the national retail federation , and aetna insurance this bill will no longer apply a more restrictive standard to mental health coverage and another more lenient standard be applied to medical and surgical coverage what we are doing is a matter of simple fairness statistics demonstrate that there is a significant need for this change in policy currently , percent of american adults or nearly million people suffer from a diagnosable mental illness each year six percent of those adults suffer from a serious mental illness additionally , more than , people commit suicide each year in the united states we need to reduce these numbers , and i believe expanding access to mental health services will allow us to do so this bill will provide mental health parity for about million americans who work for employers with or more employees and ensure health plans do not place more restrictive conditions on mental health coverage than on medical and surgical coverage additionally , the legislation includes parity for financial requirements such as deductibles , copayments , and annual lifetime limits also , this bill includes parity for treatment limitations regarding the number of covered hospital days and visits this bill does not mandate the coverage of mental health nor does it prohibit a health plan from managing mental health benefits in order to ensure only medically necessary treatments are covered again , i would like to thank everyone who contributed to the development of this legislation i believe we are making a difference today and i look forward to working with my colleagues to move this bill forward i ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill to be printed in the record there being no objection , the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the record , as follows here is the text of the bill s be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled ,
