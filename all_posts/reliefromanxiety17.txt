i want to put this out there for all of those who are attending university unfortunately it is often not very well known , that dsa is available for students whom have long term mental illnesses that affect their daily lives , including the likes of anxiety and depression i was a part of my university 's welfare committee and when i brought it up at the meeting , the staff themselves were not aware that such a thing existed dsa stands for disability student allowance and in a nutshell provides with all of the things you need to help you through university if you have a disability in the uk this can be done through student finance in my case , i applied through student finance before i got to university , but it can also be done during university you have to provide them with evidence of your condition which is usually in the form of a doctors note , attend an assessment and amongst other correspondence and depending on budget , you should get the help you need amongst receiving a laptop , printer and some other things the most helpful thing for me was having access to a mental health mentor my mentor was outstanding and was the best mentor and counsellor i have had in all the many people i have seen it definitely helped me immensely and i would strongly recommend it because often university counselling services do not provide the in depth service that is needed i strongly recommend that you get in touch so you can get the help you need please do n't be ashamed , it 's for your benefit to get help amy xx
