my counselor has an interesting theory on why i have so much anxiety in my life it boils down to not being ok with myself and all the imperfections and flaws that make me , well , me ! i know i do n't value myself i do n't abuse my body with alcohol , tobacco , or drugs , but i do abuse my mind and spirit with negative thinking for too long i 've defined my self concept on how i perceive others view me and , being an anxious person , i always assume the worse although i'm years old , i 've never become comfortable in my own skin , and i 've focused on having the perfect home , the perfect body , the perfect job so that others would approve of me so no wonder i'm anxious ! too much of my life has been spent focusing on what others think of me actually , what i think they think ! my internal critical voice has become too strong at the expense of my nurturing voice my counselor believes my anxieties and obsessions at any given time are just the latest flashpoints reflective of a deeper internal struggle to accept and love myself it admittedly sounds kinda airy fairy , but it makes sense if i pay more attention to my nurturing voice , find time for me to relax , make myself and mental health the real priorities , and not worry about what i think other people are thinking , my anxiety should decrease this is a deep concept , and i hope this post makes some sense could overcoming anxiety be as simple but difficult as truly feeling ok , authentically believing i am a valuable , worthy , lovable , good person ?
