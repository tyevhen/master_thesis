i ran this morning it was the first time i 'd exercised in days i went back to bed after my run it was in the morning two days ago i fell asleep after work and went to bed at pm last night i fell asleep after work and went to bed at pm i 've been tired i hate feeling so tired despite having a wonderful weekend away with my friends last weekend , the fatigue i was beginning to feel prior to that weekend escalated over this past week we had a major snowstorm on monday , so i was n't able to get to work that meant , after shoveling out for two hours , i had to work tuesday through saturday we 've been very busy at work , so i had some long days in there , too the week concluded with a very chaotic , short staffed , long work day yesterday it 's no wonder i fell asleep shortly after getting home fatigue , as i 've noted here before , is one of the long standing , persistent symptoms of my depression i never seem to be rid of it even when my mood is good , the fatigue persists i'm less fatigued when my mood is good , but it never goes away for that reason i do n't tolerate successive long days of work like i used to prior to depression and this was a long week i hate fatigue it is a constant reminder of my illness , and it interferes with my life missing days of exercise when i'm battling to get back into shape really hurts i know , i know it 's not the end of the world i'm just frustrated i do n't like it when depression symptoms interfere with my goals , especially when i otherwise feel well perhaps , once again , i need to work on acceptance accepting that i'm not able to do things like i used to prior to depression , like work successive days without bonking , would probably help me feel less frustrated instead i feel like i'm banging my head against a wall the wall survives , but my head hurts i guess fatigue is tough for me to accept i'm tired of feeling tired i want to feel normal i hope the extra sleep i allowed myself this morning will kick start my energy once again this week is going to be another busy one at work , and i 'd like to handle it better this week than i did last i 'll keep working on that acceptance thing , too
