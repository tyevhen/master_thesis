roy taught me how to play risk today as you can tell from the title of the post , he won by a lot no mercy at all his little gold men ruled and they ganged up on my little red guys and he plucked them off , one by one , methodically and brutally i thought i owned america , but it did n't matter he took my home base of indonesia , held his own madagascar ever so dear , and trounced the rest of us with competitive zeal so you know a little about us from reading shrink rap and playing risk proved to be as a good a way as any to study personality roy has wondered if he has add he does n't i'm a bit obsessive i spent the game lining up the little soldiers who were n't in play first they were arranged in rows , then in a straight line , finally , with a bit of agitation , they stood in a disheartened clump roy was cautious and concerned with a big picture , but his little soldier guys were lying around everywhere i let his ones in waiting just lie there the ones in play i had to stand up and arrange within the borders of their territories roy was meticulous with his planning and strategy i just wanted to attack any where i could my real life demands some attention to detail , i was n't investing any of it in a board game here was my chance to let loose our third player , like roy , took the game pretty seriously and really wanted to understand it i just wanted to play , who cares about the rules ? and spent a fair amount of time contemplating the next move processing information was what i was told when i asked how spending all this time helped anything and then i wondered why i got laid out in the dust with those little soldiers and to think , i thought i could expand into canada
