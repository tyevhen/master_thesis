i 've spoken so much about mental health over the past few years that you 'd think that i 'd be totally comfortable with the notion and it 's fair to say that i am i'm not ashamed of it and i'm certainly not afraid at speaking out about it to raise awareness i'm quite happy to share advice from my personal experience and help others with tips and tricks that have helped me however , i feel my words do n't seem to touch the people who are closest to me over the years , many friends and family members have opened up about their struggles with mental health which is great the other day however , my friend had told me that they had just been put on medication and had been struggling with anxiety and depression she was always the friend that i thought would be okay , but it just shows that anyone can be affected she was clearly upset at the time and i could just tell how low she was and how raw the illness was at that time it 's strange though , because it was so raw it made it harder for me to find the words i think it 's because i knew exactly how she felt and how i only could hope that i could drag her out of what she was feeling i almost felt as if i knew that whatever i said would n't make things better there and then all i could do was comfort and explain that things do get better , to ask more about any support , friends and family , how she was feeling and that i have been there too perhaps that was all i was meant to say , but i felt much less confident in my replies it 's important to remember that there is no right way to comfort someone who is going through mental health struggles , but it is important to be sensitive , responsive and compassionate when someone is in the midst of the most severe days of their illness , it does feel hard to find the words to help them through , but you just need to let them know that you are there for them and suggest any help that they can get it 's when we do n't support each other that we can slip through the cracks talking about the most important things in life are going to be hard , especially if it takes you by surprise but it is key that the opportunity is n't missed how do you feel are the best ways to talk ? amy xx
