of course i have asked myself this question a million times when it comes to jack but lately i have been hearing it all over the place a few people at cisco asked me , his grandmother asked me , the camp counselors asked me , a kid at the ot office asked me the short answer is no jack never ever gets tired ok , once in awhile , but honestly , the only times he has fallen asleep during the day since he was months old were when he was sick , or when he was on adhd medication that caused him to wake up hourly every single night does he sleep after anesthesia ? nope after a long day at the beach ? not really christmas night ? heck no i think his kindergarten teacher has seen him sleep more during the day after this year than i ever have sometimes he would conk out or times a day in school while he was on medication those medications were obviously stopped jack never slept as a baby his first daycare provider , who had raised children of her own , lost lbs the first week she cared for him he was months old at the time he would nap , on someone , for minutes at a time the bassinet fail pack and play fail co sleeper strapped to the bed ? fail i moved out of our master bedroom that first year and slept in a twin bed with jack it was the only way we could get any sleep and i went back to work full time when he was weeks old i had to sleep somehow he would be up all day at family events , or anytime we were out people would say things like wow is he going to sleep when he gets home ha i say saying that out loud was the ultimate curse and he would not sleep at all now i know that these were signs of what was to come at the time i just felt like a failure as a mother i even had a mommy friend who when she had her second child who was a horrible sleeper vs her first who did great said to me that she just thought i was n't doing a good job getting jack to sleep before she had her second child then she got it if you 've had a poor sleeper , you know exactly what i am talking about the smug parents who think they are just doing it right i 've got news for you it 's not you it 's them the first time i put nate in the bassinet and he just curled up and went to sleep ? i cried with relief so this was what everyone was talking about ! they do sleep ! and nate is still a great sleeper no intervention needed when jack was about months i decided it was time to lay down the law we tried crying it out he went for nearly hours and then puked we tried again same result there was never that whole self calming thing with jack in fact , i had no idea what that was until i had nate and he did it soooooo weird so after several weeks of trying this , i dragged the twin mattress into his nursery and slept on it , while i weaned him into the crib the process took about months he could cry it out if i could at least hold his hand through the crib he would eventually calm down so this is what i did when he got a new toy , he would be up all night the next night he could not shut off he could not stop thinking about it most of these toys were planes , so if he had them with him , he would lie there and just continuously spin the propellor all night i would have him leave the toy downstairs , and he would have a meltdown i took to cutting a picture of the toy from the box and putting it into his bed with him this worked sometimes to this day , jack wakes up at least nights a week , multiple times i have not slept in years i had to get a white noise machine for nathan when he was a baby so that his big brother would not wake him up in the middle of the night ! so to the professionals who are no doubt exhausted after trying to keep up with him all day the answer is once again , no , he never does get tired but me ? i am tired john is tired after six years , we are really , really tired
