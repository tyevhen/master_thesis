hi friends ! we were so excited to put in a master bathroom over the past few months we 've wanted one since we moved here in and it 's now here ! the whole space used to be all closet there was one giant walk in closet and then a doorway to a long skinny coat closet we knocked down the wall between and but the bathroom in but left room for a smaller walk in closet i'm just thrilled to have a closet at all the one we now have is my dream ! here 's a tour first , we go through the closet and there we are ! here 's the shower we went with a rain head and a hand held that has a pivoting rotating head here 's the tub i wanted the bathroom to have a s s bungalow feel we did a smaller tub in here we have a big one in our other bathroom and it 's hard to give the kiddos a bath in it the smaller tub is the same depth , but more narrow and easier to lean in there 's a handset here too , for rinsing hair and soap , etc it 's useful for cleaning the tub as well there 's our new window ! that was n't there before either here 's the vanity ! i wanted to add some architectural interest around the built in mirror cabinets the wall paint color ? i'm not sure of the brand , but i know it 's called palladian i'm in love with the light fixture another antique bungalow inspiration here 's what the faucets look like again , going for more of an antique bungalow vibe and here is some tile detailing that goes around the tub and shower so that 's it ! we 're so happy with it i'm so grateful for it thanks for touring with me ! now we just have to fully move in to the space ! i hope you have a great tuesday ! save
