the brain fuck continues i slept almost all day yesterday even when i tried to wake up it proved very difficult made it out to a coffee date with a friend for about one hour but was back asleep soon after returning home despite planning to watch a football game i woke up in my chair as the final two minutes ticked away right now , i could n't even tell you who played i made it to my morning aa meeting today , but i was bothered by negative , intruding thoughts throughout i went swimming after the meeting , which was a minor miracle , as i really wanted to come home and go back to bed swimming went well , but i could n't believe the intrusive thoughts followed me right underwater ! horrible , disgusting thoughts i usually ca n't think of anything but my swimming form and lap count while in the pool , so i was very disturbed horrible thoughts i do n't get it i do n't get it the rest of the day has been filled with restlessness tried to watch some football again today , but was unable to focus on or care about the game that 's atypical i'm uncomfortable at home , but it 's painful to be out , too i know , because i just went to the mall to poke around something i never do , but i did n't know where else to go or what to do there was an event at my church tonight , but the thought of hanging around with people i knew was even more dreadful than anonymously walking around the mall i feel like people can see right through me vacant unfortunately , i also feel caged in my house the options seem limited i do n't know what to do i'm uncomfortable i'm scared i do n't like feeling like this i do n't want to keep having fucked up thoughts out of the blue this is depression having its way with me i'm trying to remember it will pass it will pass right ? god , i wish it would pass soon now
