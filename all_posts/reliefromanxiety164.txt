for some this post may be triggering , so please do n't feel you need to carry on reading the charity samaritans are here to help , you can call them on uk i 've decided to take this step into writing this post because i very rarely see anyone talking about this topic directly it 's always covered up or ignored even though the loss of life is very real suicide , which i'm sure many of you are aware of , or have thought about is the taking one 's own life i know for many this post will want to be avoided because you do n't want to think about it but , this is exactly the point suicide and it 's awareness cannot be ignored for any longer here in england , there is a death every two hours this death could be your family member , your friend , your partner , parent or teacher this is what makes the statistic even more shocking and the worst part is that people still ignore it suicide is a very real problem and there is the possibility that someone close to you is experiencing suicidal feelings or has tried to kill themselves you may not even know and that is the scariest part occasionally however , a person may show signs of needing help or even directly asking for help please make sure you are a listening ear try just to listen , and to not make any comments on the matter there are signs to be looking out for and ways to help , which you can read about , here suicide is n't always directly connected to a mental health issue and there does n't need to be a reason for it either way , it can still be fatal by writing this post , i do n't just want to raise awareness , but i want to make sure that you understand something when we feel suicidal , there is no way out , there is no help , there is often the feeling that no one understands and some people even feel that no one would miss them or love them but , let me tell you this people will miss you and people do love you whatever you are facing , and for however long , whether it 's months or years , you can keep going often , the endless pain with no happiness for so long , and even the loss of what we once had leads us to feeling that we do n't have the strength to carry on and i know that it is what you experiencing but , let me tell you even when you feel you are taking your last few breaths , you do have the strength to carry on , there is a way out and it will come in time life is very unexpected and one day you will find the light again , and you will enjoy the love of life once more i do n't blame you at all for feeling like you do , but trust me when i say it will get better even if what i'm writing sounds like a shot in the dark and completely false , i do know that you can get there best wishes and keep fighting , amy xx
