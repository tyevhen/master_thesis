today is john 's my husband 's birthday ! happy birthday honey ! something i have been working on with jack more lately is the treatment of others i want him to understand how to be kind , and that everyone deserves to feel special we worked on this on father 's day , when jack helped me set up john 's new hammock let 's just say i ended up rigging up one end with the dog 's choke chain no joke , cook pancakes , bacon and sausage two breakfast meats for father 's day , argh and of course get daddy 's father 's day card ready i guess every family treats these types of occasions differently , there really is no right or wrong i have always been of the mind set that a birthday is a very big deal and that each individual should be treated as such we all deserve a day that 's about us every once in awhile i have always done this for the people i care about , and i try to be as thoughtful as possible you know , favorite meal , nice gift , i 'll do your chores type stuff i want jack to do this for others as well i want him to understand that giving of himself is very important and that it can feel good too i picked jack up from camp yesterday and we got to work on daddy 's cake jack was very into it he cracked all the eggs , added all the ingredients , and as always , he was very enthusiastic with the electric mixer so very similar to a propeller after all he was also very into tasting go figure the bakers hard at work the finished product it 's gluten dairy free because daddy is a good sport jack did a great job this evening of letting it be daddy 's birthday , for sure the best he 's ever done he sat nicely at dinner , no meltdowns , he brought daddy his gift , and even handed him his others to unwrap in the past he would have flipped that they were n't for him s o that 's definite progress he also waited patiently for cake he had to wait an hour and a half , and he did it proud of my boy today
