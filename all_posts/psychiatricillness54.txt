those negative thoughts are becoming a real battle i was promoted at work and i find promotions a really stressful experiance i know if i was feeling well i would be coping a lot better than i am now i have a very high work load but no energy and i do not seem able to concentrate and break big things down into manageable chunks i went to a pub quiz last night and it went on and on so i did not get home until late i think i am over tired and i am hoping a good nights sleep will fix the problem i came home from work at lunch time today and it was only earlier this week that i was starting to feel well again i am starting to ignore people who are giving me a lot of hassle and demanding work from me which i do not have tme to do i think it is a ticking time bomb !
