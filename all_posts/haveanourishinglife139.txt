my first encounter with a whole foods store was in college my initial reaction was that the prices were way too expensive for an undergrad student i was also amazed that even things in a box were labeled organic before i went to a whole foods or trader joe s type store , organic food , from my understanding , was straight from the garden or the farm i didn t like whole foods , at first glance , because i am frugal however , because everyone else thought it was cool , i pretended to like it as well and then , after participating in the organic culture a few times , i became obsessed every time i went into the store , the shopping experience and pressure to eat right fueled my eating disorder in college and during the few years after , i spent way too much money on trying to eat healthy i thought i was doing the right thing but , in reality , i was causing myself needless anxiety it was exhausting trying to keep up with the latest nutrition news , going to the store every day , exercising at the gym , and preparing all my food while trying to do my best at my job i ve been internally torn on the subject of organic food ever since it became more popular part of me knows that eating good quality food is a really good thing , health wise but another part of me has some hesitation i couldn t explain my thoughts about organic food until i had a conversation with a farmer organic foods have to comply with certain standards before they are allowed to carry that label basically , they are produced without chemicals , pesticides , or steroids it is a seemly logically decision to buy organic if that reason was the only defining factor however , there is more to it than meets the eye first , there are availability problems right now , with the current world situation , there is not enough organic food to go around not everyone can reap the benefits of local , whole , organic , pure , raw foods if we did not have the modern conventional ways of growing and producing food , not as many people could be fed second , there is the price difference sure you can say that you can t put a price on health , and i whole heartedly agree , no pun intended but i don t agree with the phrase , if you haven t got your health , then you haven t got anything if you are not healthy , you still have so much ! you have a soul , right ? if we didn t have a soul than suffering from unhealthiness , or any suffering at all , wouldn t make any sense but there is salvation in suffering not having perfect food can be a cross if you let it i view this dilemma the same as not having the perfect clothes or the perfect house life is not perfect , moving on also , you do not have a moral obligation to eat pure organic food all the time however , you do have a moral obligation to provide for your family if you can t make the mortgage payment because your grocery bill is too high , then , i think , there is a problem in my opinion , if you can t afford organic food all the time , it s ok it is not a sin to buy aldi food for me , i love the fact that we have a garden in our back yard we are growing radishes , spinach , carrots , green beans , squash , tomatoes , peppers , sunflowers , and a variety of herbs if they ever decide to sprout gardening is good for my spirit i am going to try to make my own salsa and i am really excited about going to the garden to pick some fresh spinach for a salad last year , i roasted sunflowers seeds , and , i have to say , that harvesting the seeds was one of the most fun garden projects i ve ever done someday , my husband and i would love to live in the country and become more self sustainable maybe a bigger garden , a few animals , and a bee hive but if it never happens , that s ok too the most important thing in my life is that my husband and i get to heaven
