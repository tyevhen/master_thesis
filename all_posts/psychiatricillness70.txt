it is so nice having more hours in the day ! my flat is reasonably tidy , i rearranged some furniture yesterday , i took my car to the garage to get the brakes checked , i have caught up on my laundry and i still have more time i am just getting ready to go to the gym for months , or even years , i have struggled to do half this much on a weekend i would stay up until about pm , sleep to pm or pm and rush around to do the housework which had been neglected all week before taking the tablets about pm to pm to give me some chance of getting up for work the next day i think only having a small tv with very few channels is also a great help when tired there is nothing better than sleeping on the sofa in front of the tv all day i have loads and loads of social activities planned for the next month or so i'm feeling much more confident about going out and meeting a bunch of strangers for a chat , a film or trying something new i'm off to the gym now as i have eaten chocalate cakes in less than hours ! i went shopping hungry o and my defences were low they were buy get free and once i have chocolate in the flat there is no hope !
