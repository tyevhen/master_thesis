there was an article published last week in slate titled bill gates is an autodidact you re probably not , and when i read it yesterday , it was pretty eye roll inducing so i decided that it was time to write a rebuttal on the blog the article starts by talking about bill gates at a young age , gates was already an autodidact , someone compelled to learn for himself what he needed to know over the course of his life , gates has maintained this habit he dropped out of college after two years , but he has continued his education through incessant reading and conversing michael specter , a new yorker writer who profiled gates for the magazine , has said that the microsoft founder is one of these autodidacts who reads , reads , reads he reads hundreds of books about immunology and biochemistry and biology , and asks a lot of questions , and because he s bill gates he can get to talk to whoever he wants many of gates fellow leaders in the ed tech world are also members of the autodidact club computer scientists , engineers , entrepreneurs , academics they are a self selected group of individuals who have schooled themselves in a fast changing field for which there is no settled syllabus , no well established curriculum this seems to be a pretty clear case of someone seeing autodidacts as special the geniuses , those destined for greatness , no matter what they face the autodidact club is thus considered to be something pretty exclusive though that particular club might be exclusive , i think it 's pretty misleading to think that the fact they 're autodidacts is the main thing that sets them apart i 'd argue that what sets them apart is that they 're business people , corporatists , very wealthy , and largely male also almost certainly largely white statistically , the richest and most successful people in america tend to be both a white and b male , so i figure it 's a pretty good guess no , these people are not your every man , but i do n't think being an autodidact or not has all that much to do with it source the author continues with what is their main point of the article most people are not autodidacts in order to learn effectively , they need guidance provided by teachers they need support provided by peers and they need structure provided by institutions do they now i know a whole lot of unschoolers who would disagree productive learning without guidance and support from others is rare it seems that the author suffers from the misconception that self directed learning means learning entirely and completely on your own , alone , with no help , ever while i disagree in a major way that learners need guidance provided by teachers and structure provided by institutions , self directed learners do need other people peers , mentors , parents , and yes , sometimes even teachers the thing is , self directed means just that the individual is making the decisions about their own lives and learning these decisions can include a large amount of other people , and even a large amount of structure it all depends on the individual learner and what they want and need a pair of eminent researchers has gone so far as to call the very notion of self directed learning an urban legend in education i well i told my sister , emilie , about the urban legend thing and she laughed hi , i'm bigfoot ! was her response emilie 's life and my own life are proof against this supposed truth but lest anyone quickly jump to the then you must be special ! conclusion , i 'd like to point out that every single unschooler i 've met is proof against this absurd idea lifelong unschoolers and unschoolers who left school in elementary , middle , or high school unschoolers who left school because they were struggling , and unschoolers who left because they did n't feel challenged unschoolers whose parents made the choice to unschool , and those individuals who chose themselves we 're all managing to learn just fine , in the most self directed way you can find ! so , who are these apparently eminent researchers and what are their conclusions ? in a paper published in educational psychologist last year , paul a kirschner of the open university of the netherlands and jeroen j g van merri nboer of maastricht university challenge the popular assumption that it is the learner who knows best and that she or he should be the controlling force in her or his learning there are three problems with this premise , van merri nboer and kirschner write the first is that novices , by definition , don t yet know much about the subject they re learning , and so are ill equipped to make effective choices about what and how to learn next the second problem is that learners often choose what they prefer , but what they prefer is not always what is best for them that is , they practice tasks that they enjoy or are already proficient at , instead of tackling the more difficult tasks that would actually enhance their expertise and third , although learners like having some options , unlimited choices quickly become frustrating as well as mentally taxing , constraining the very learning such freedom was supposed to liberate again , i find myself re reading to make sure i actually read it properly the first time this reads like just the regular criticisms everyone has about self directed learning children do n't know what 's best for themselves , you ca n't trust children , people say , and if no one 's making them do hard things , they 'll never do anything difficult ! though to be honest , i 've never heard the researchers last assertion , that choices are bad wow okay i think i am a very different person from those researchers , who are apparently pretty overwhelmed with the vast variety of choices life represents i loved how my sister put it , in discussion about this article she said that while in theory there might be unlimited choices , there are n't actually , because life does n't work that way you want to go out to eat , so theoretically you could go to any single restaurant in the city , but in reality your choices are going to be based on what 's close to you , what 's within your price range , what type of cuisine you like , what you 're in the mood for , what any friends or family you 're going to dinner with like in practice , you 'll be able to pare down your theoretical choices to a few actual options pretty quickly that 's how all choices , including about your learning , work as emilie said i could try and go into engineering school tomorrow that 's a choice i could make but it would n't make any sense based on my interests or goals or the past choices i 've made this 'too many choices are bad' thing seems pretty detached from the reality of how people make choices when it comes to needing experienced teachers to steer a novice learner , that 's why , as i mentioned before , unschoolers often choose to make other people part of their learning emilie has been taking ninjutsu classes since she was that 's because she ca n't learn ninjitsu on her own her choice to start classes and her choice to continue them are all her own self directed , yes , but not something she 's pursuing alone i wondered if these researchers were being quoted out of context it seemed , to me , that their paper sounded more like an an attempt at legitimizing what educators want to believe in regards to why self directed learning ca n't possibly work even though it obviously does than anything else but was that really the case ? sadly , it seems so the summary of their paper is this this article takes a critical look at three pervasive urban legends in education about the nature of learners , learning , and teaching and looks at what educational and psychological research has to say about them the three legends can be seen as variations on one central theme , namely , that it is the learner who knows best and that she or he should be the controlling force in her or his learning the first legend is one of learners as digital natives who form a generation of students knowing by nature how to learn from new media , and for whom old media and methods used in teaching learning no longer work the second legend is the widespread belief that learners have specific learning styles and that education should be individualized to the extent that the pedagogy of teaching learning is matched to the preferred style of the learner the final legend is that learners ought to be seen as self educators who should be given maximum control over what they are learning and their learning trajectory it concludes with a possible reason why these legends have taken hold , are so pervasive , and are so difficult to eradicate i disagree that these are common notions it 's only very recently that self directed education has become trendy again , and the vast majority of people still feel strongly that the way people learn is by being taught , by a teacher , in a school the authors of the above paper provide no new research , and simply quote research done by others , pulled specifically to make their points which are pretty clearly stated in the above summary i will point out that the slate article obscures the fact they 're talking specifically about the idea of self directed learning online , but then again , though that 's what the authors of the paper claim they 're looking at , they seem to lump all self directed learning together , whether online or not so i 'd say the slate article is a pretty accurate representation of what these authors are saying basically that they 're pissed that teachers might be losing power , and students gaining some , and they want it to stop , because they claim science is n't behind these changes , which is bad but back to the slate article according to the bio on the article , this story was produced by the hechinger report , a nonprofit , nonpartisan education news outlet based at teachers college , columbia university i think that really puts it all in perspective while they might be nonpartisan , i 'd hardly consider a teacher 's college to be unbiased when it comes to the role of teachers and schools in society their very livelihood depends on teachers retaining power , and students staying in school , listening to the teachers so that 's the reason this is a subject that seems so important to the author and the central point that the author seems to be attempting to drive home in protection of their livelihood is that self directed learning is n't for everyone most people ca n't do it only special people learn that way i grew up a life learner an autodidact , if you will i called the important shots in my own education , and still do today i did n't sneak out of my house as gates did to work on supercomputers , i do n't read texts on immunology and biochemistry , and i'm not a scientist , engineer , or academic by all accounts i'm not part of an exclusive autodidact club made up of the rich and influential what i am is a plain old run of the mill self directed learner the type who learned to read because i loved harry potter , who memorized old poems , wrote books reviews , studied world war ii , played for hours with my sister , and learned alongside my family as a child i'm the type of autodidact who spends hours in the kitchen working on a new dish , and tons of time writing about self directed education the type who reads books about living on less money and re imagining domesticity saved how i quit worrying about money and became the richest man in the world and radical homemakers reclaiming domesticity from a consumer culture , and on unschooling and alternative education i finished challenging assumptions in education recently , and am now in the middle of the unschooling unmanual i go to workshops and talks and conferences on my favourite subjects , such as unschooling and alternative education and preserving food how my life and education looks is intimately shaped by my own passions and interests and goals that 's how being a self directed learner works sometimes what you 're doing will look impressive , and sometimes it wo n't that 's perfectly fine we do n't have to be impressive and autodidacts as a whole are certainly not part of a special club i also think it 's important to recognize the role school and forced teaching play in killing motivation as unschoolers we end up repeating , time and time again , that humans are innate learners , that babies learn to walk and talk because they have a burning desire to learn , grow , and become a part of the culture they find themselves in humans are perhaps best defined by our ability to learn , our ability to adapt , our flexibility and busy minds so why does it seem so hard for so many people to grasp that learning is n't something that must be induced in someone ? it 's not something you have to make people do learning is something you need to support , to encourage , and sometimes just to keep out of the way of if supportive environments are provided , and people stop putting blocks in front of learners in the form of curriculum that must be followed , times in which learning must occur , tests and assessments and grading , then learning will happen enthusiastically and well we want to learn it 's in our nature which is why i'm an autodidact or life learner , as i sometimes prefer to call myself and you know what ? so are you embrace it , and enjoy your own uniquely individual self directed learning journey
