i was talking to my counsellor the other day about how i feel that i should have gotten over a traumatic experience that happened to me back when i was seven years old i kept saying that as a twenty year old , i should be able to have the strength to not let it affect me any more and i feel angry that it still manages to be present in my every day life my counsellor suggested an analogy and said for me to imagine a burn on my arm you would n't just put your arm in a box and ignore it , rather you would try to heal it and make it better and in the same way , when a piece of your past raises its head , you must n't put it down and feel bad for it appearing , but care for it and let the feelings flow although , this is important to do , i still ca n't help the feeling of frustration that the past still affects me so much to this day , i am still haunted by it because there has n't been a time where i have had a full and understanding closure , but rather a continuation of harm and hurt to which i cannot heal but , i had the choice from that day to let it affect me to the core , or to try and get through it and that 's what i 've done to this day , i have accomplished so much in regards to my anxiety , depression and other family issues that have made daily life an incredible struggle and i am proud on the other side , i know that the past will always be with me , as hard as i try to let it go or put it away if the person still acts in a way that is detrimental , it is still going to be with me but , this does n't mean that we have no choice you have the strength to get to where you want to be , regardless even though the traumatic events that i faced as young child have caused me problems and changed me for the rest of my life i know that the events have caused me issues with mental illness , with health anxiety , with relationship struggles , with trust and with shutting down to protect myself i know that and as much as i hate it , i must continue to battle to get where i want to be i want you to know , that you can do it too it may take everything in your power to get through it , but you have the strength to beat your past even if your past may be part of your journey , it does n't mean that 's the end amy xx
