so i'm going to share with you my very first baby related purchase as i promised yesterday it 's more for me , as i 'd said , but i'm getting more brave toward the idea of getting things just for baby i'm really waiting for after i know if we are having a boy or girl anyway , it 's a diaper bag by oioi called the giraffe tote you can find it here yes , it was a big splurge but i figure it will get a ton of use and after over a year and a half of researching diaper bags during each pregnancy this was the only one that screamed i'm yours ! to me i wanted to truly love the look of the bag and i wanted to make sure it came with everything it needed while still being stylish it fit the bill and is now mine mind you , i 've never owned anything with an animal print on it but , for some reason , this reads more as a general pattern for me i know the look is not for everyone , but i was thrilled to find it it 's made of a tough canvas material and the inner liner is waterproof the bag comes with changing pad , insulated bottle holder , wipes case , and dirty duds pouch it also features little straps you can attach as loops that can affix to a stroller you can see oioi 's other diaper bags collections and products here all images were pulled from babycenter com 's online store the svelte blonde model is also obviously not me i'm sure the baby is n't hers either save
