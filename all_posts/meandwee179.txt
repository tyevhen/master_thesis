hi friends ! i'm sorry i 've been missing in these parts ! the family has been sick with an evil virus and we 're just coming back to life that , and the day to day life doing stay at home mom things has been hectic and exhausting what else is new , right ? in truth , lately i 've been missing my work life my creative life i find myself trolling blogs , pinterest , and etsy admiring the work of others and how i 'd love to get back into making art again before i had the kiddos i had a decent business creating wedding invitations and letterpressed goods for clients as well as letterpressed stationery in my online store since i'm staying a home with the kids , i simply do not have any time anymore for a career at least , not now anyway after a long day of mothering , i collapse into bed at night exhausted i just do n't have it in me to sit down and commence a second job after the kids have gone to bed i need a break too ! child care is very expensive and i was n't making enough money to cover it the nature of my work does n't really allow me to work for minutes and stop which is also the nature of mothering young children working at home without help is out of the question add in the challenges of a special needs child and forget it ! i 've resolved to wait until my children are in school full time to pursue a full time business again but , i want to get creative again i 've been thinking about the goals i have for the future and what it is i really want to be doing professionally my dream ? to have an online shop where i sell whimsical art prints , original art , stationery , and other goods from illustrations i create myself i want it to be a cohesive brand a line of recognizable work i want to make a decent living off making art that people enjoy to do that , i 'd like to spend my nuggets of free time they do happen on occasion on developing my own personal artistic illustrative style i'm going to experiment with my art and try lots of new things and see what i like best i have a hundred ideas swimming in my head and they are desperate to come out now , to find the time to do it ! that 's the challenge for most sahms right ? i think my blog here will be a good place to share my progress and hold myself accountable perhaps i can share snippets of my work with you ? share what i'm thinking ? i'm willing to bet there 's lots of other people out there who are also sitting on a dream and wondering when the time will be right i figure i may as well start now that way , when the time is right i can act on it i started a painting months and months ago it 's the image i posted above long before noah was born i finally found a few extra minutes today to finish it it 's nothing fancy , but i'm proud i finally created something ! what do you think ? i do n't know what the future holds , but i do know it feels good to create again to experience that old familiar excitement in my stomach when i'm making something i like or have an idea i love there 's a rush of energy that comes with it that feeds my soul it reminds me that i'm a person too feel free to share your dream or wish here ! sometimes putting down into words can help make it come to life save
