i think you guys are probably used to my utter weirdness at this point at least i would hope so , most people outside of my family are n't it 's always nice to find people who are like cat , who when i saw her dreads and was like i must make you into a female jack sparrow she seemed unfazed and actually ecstatic about it the world needs more people like her thanks for the fantastic shoot , catherine also i stole this song idea from the hillywood show 's parody of pirates of the caribbean i'm sorry this post is so long , i had a hard time choosing the pictures this was a last minute shoot , we did a value village run , went home threw the costume together got starbucks and headed to the beach , really happy with how it turned out had an absolute blast !
