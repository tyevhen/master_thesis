in a decision which can only be described as baffling , the pentagon has decided that a purple heart shall be awarded only to those who suffer physical injuries during a war this is a slap in the face to our country 's military personnel who bravely risked their lives , shockingly witnessed violence , maiming and death , and then tragically lost their jobs , homes and families as a result of post traumatic stress disorder ptsd perhaps loss of function would be a better determinant of who should and should not qualify for one of our military 's highest honors is a traumatized soldier who ca n't sleep , ca n't work , ca n't sustain his marriage , and eventually commits suicide as a direct result of his war experiences less deserving of this medal than a soldier who takes a bullet fragment in the ass ? how can anyone , even a government agency , ponder such a comparison and still find justice in this decision ? stigma and discrimination rear their ever present , ugly heads once again to the u s servicemen and women belittled by this ridiculous policy , let me be the first to say , i'm sorry
