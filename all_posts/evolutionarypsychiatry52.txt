right on the heels of the little case study i wrote about last time came a paper in jama that made a bit of a splash in the news effects of fructose vs glucose on regional cerebral blood flow in brain regions involved with appetite and reward pathways i know sounds like a nail biter stone temple pilots pretty penny from ! ancient history i like the fresh time signature used in the song the paper is a tale of two sugars , glucose and fructose fructose is somewhat sweeter than glucose , and it is metabolized differently as those in the paleosphere are no doubt agonizingly aware fructose , for example , only causes slight bumps in insulin , which is known to work in the central nervous system to increase the satiety and decrease the reward value of food compared to glucose , fructose also does n't increase a satiety hormone glucagon like polypeptide , and fructose does n't decrease levels of ghrelin , an appetite stimulating hormone let 's translate into something simple rather than paperspeak glucose increases insulin , increases glp , decreases ghrelin all of which increase satiety and decrease reward seeking behavior fructose barely increases insulin , does n't increase glp , and does n't decrease ghrelin , so after ingestion you will presumably still be hungry and looking for the next bag of skittles in rats , if you inject fructose into the brain , it stimulates food seeking behavior if you inject glucose into the brain , rats decrease their food intake please do not inject fructose or glucose into your brain and while that rat factoid is certainly interesting , i'm hoping that when you drink a vat of agave nectar , much of the fructose does n't get past the liver anyway , as it is pretty oxidizing and toxic in the bloodstream in human and rat brains , appetite is controlled in the hypothalamus sleep kinda lives there too it 's also part of the hpa axis that makes up our stress response and the researchers hypothesized that if fructose stimulates appetite more than glucose , it will increase blood flow in the hypothalamus and other reward areas of the brain they rustled up some humans and stuck them in a functional mri to measure brain blood flow , and out came some data here 's another good stp song that you may not have heard , atlanta from no normal weight , non diabetic healthy volunteers were used , men and women , average age the women were all scanned during the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle each volunteer was scanned and blood samples were taken after an overnight fast then they drank a glucose and on a separate day a fructose sweetened drink and were scanned again after minutes the order of drinks was blinded and randomized the drinks are described as g of sweetener , plus cherry flavored water participants were asked to rate fullness , and serum levels of glucose , appetite hormones , insulin , etc were measured at minute intervals after injestion through the scanning serum levels of fructose were also examined , to see how much got past the liver in a complimentary rodent experiment , they gave rats fructose iv and then measured the amounts of fructose that were in the brain to see if some made it through the blood brain barrier interesting the results ! well , hypothalamic blood flow tended to decrease after ingestion of glucose within minutes ingestion wheras it did not with fructose at all time points , blood flow in the hypothalamus was decreased after glucose compared to fructose drinks presumably meaning that appetite was decreased after the glucose ingestion but not decreased with fructose ingestion glucose also decreased activity in the brain 's striatum , which fructose did not predictably , both plasma glucose and insulin increased with glucose ingestion , whereas there was very little increase with fructose ingestion plasma fructose in humans did increase after fructose ingestion compared to glucose scary , and , duh , but levels of ghrelin and leptin were not different in the two groups another hormone , pyy , and then lactate was higher in the fructose drinkers the glucose drinkers felt less hungry and more sated after drinking , whereas fructose drinkers still felt somewhat hungry and not quite as satisfied after the drink in the rodent study , fructose in the plasma did translate to an increase in fructose in the brain compared to a saline iv , and they found that the rna for fructose transporters glut were expressed in the hypothalamus , liver , and kidney so , for a small study , rather interesting big difference in straight up fructose vs glucose in how the brain and appetite centers react , and one would tend to think from the results that glucose decreases appetite and reduces food seeking behaviors , whereas fructose does n't really fill you up of course , no one drinks straight fructose unless you are glopping agave nectar into your tea , and it would have been interesting to see what the soda version of hfcs from memory , i think it is fructose , glucose did compared to straight up glucose and fizzy hard to blind that one ! and cherry flavored ! someone get me some healthy volunteers and an enormously expensive functional mri machine ! do n't drink a vat of agave nectar the typical oral glucose tolerance test is g of dextrose in an orange flavored concoction
