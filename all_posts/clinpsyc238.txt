over at furious seasons , philip dawdy has a long and highly recommended post on the latest in the child bipolar wars it is regarding the recent boston globe interview with dr joe biederman , who clearly believes that child bipolar is relatively common and undertreated background on child bipolar here and here i'm in firm disagreement with biederman , but am more than willing to change my position should the science start to improve what really concerned me was how biederman discussed his critics in the globe article biederman dismisses most critics , saying that they cannot match his scientific credentials as co author of scientific papers a year and director of a major research program at the psychiatry department that is top ranked in the us news world report ratings the critics 'are not on the same level we are not debating as to whether a critic likes brownies and i like hot dogs in medicine and science , not all opinions are created equal , ' said biederman , a native of czechoslovakia who came to mass general in after medical training in argentina and israel he now lives in brookline i really hope he was taken out of context and that he did n't get all braggy about his papers per year and about the us news rating of his department just because you 've published papers per year does not mean you 're right about child bipolar indeed , despite publishing a mountain of research , some questions still loom large does child bipolar really exist in substantial quantity ? does treatment help kids with this disorder ? why would a leading expert in child bipolar disorder say that up to of children who are bipolar become suicidal without citing any supporting evidence ? true , all opinions are not created equal in science but the idea that child bipolar is a hugely underdiagnosed and undermedicated condition is not backed by consistent data it would seem that biederman is confusing quantity e g , publishes a boatload of papers with quality of evidence again , please see my above questions if they can be answered sufficiently , then i 'll be glad to jump on the child bipolar bandwagon now , does this mean i'm not on his level because i have the audacity to ask questions and point out gaping holes in the so called evidence base regarding this purported disorder ? i suppose his opinion is more valid because he has published more articles than his critics ? i'm really hoping that biederman was quoted out of context , but if he was not , he looks pretty arrogant
