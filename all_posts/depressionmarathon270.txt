driving down the road , i lifted my right knee in order to move my foot from the gas to the brake pop ! ! i heard an audible pop in my right groin area followed by immediate pain the pain was so intense i became nauseous when i got home , i had to lift my leg out of my vehicle , and my right groin area had begun to bruise that was last friday evening i knew immediately something significant had happened i performed some diagnostic tests on myself i am a physical therapist , after all and determined that the source of the problem was likely muscular based on the popping sound , the area of pain and bruising , and the inability to flex my hip beyond approximately degrees , i figured i had possibly ruptured a hip flexor tendon this was not good news i was scared and discouraged over the weekend i rested , and iced , and took anti inflammatories i left a message for my surgeon monday , and when we spoke on tuesday he confirmed i had likely ruptured one of the two origins heads of the rectus femoris muscle part of the quads i still have use of my quadriceps , but my hip flexion may , or may not , remain weak long term there is no way to know at this time this injury may take up to weeks to heal , so i just have to wait and see the surgeon noted the muscle fibers were likely weakened during the surgical procedure i think he said he had to go through part of the muscle in order to shave the bone i figure the fibers must have been compromised , as the tendon ruptured with only a slight motion of my hip i was n't even doing anything stupid i e aggressive it has been a discouraging week over the past few days , the pain has diminished a bit , but i still have to lift my leg with my hands if i want to change positions i'm hopeful it will heal well the surgeon thinks i will regain my strength eventually , and i sure hope he 's right weak hip flexion is not conducive to strong or fast running and of course , that 's what i'm most concerned about at this time my level of overall fear and concern is decreasing i was really , really scared and discouraged a few days ago , but since then i 've tried to stay in today rather than projecting out into the future i ca n't control how this will heal , so worrying about it does me no good whatsoever i have to practice patience right now i have to do what i can to get better that 's the only thing of which i have any control so i'm resting , and icing , and gently exercising i'm following my restrictions and avoiding pain at all costs one moment at a time one day at a time that 's all i can do
