i was discussing the difference between self destructive behavior and suicide with a colleague they are quite different , although you would think that suicide is destruction of the self , but it is not at all like that to understand , we must go back to the imprint , as so many of my suicidal patients have done in many of these cases , the person has experienced an oxygen deficit , perhaps due to a heavy dose of anesthesia to the mother during labor , or being strangled on the cord during birth and after an agonizing attempt to get born , death approaches and there is a sense of impending relief that memory of possible relief is sealed in so that later , in the face utter hopelessness , an impending divorce for instance , death becomes the answer an attempt at suicide follows the memory of possible relief becomes stamped in , or engraved , and it endures for a lifetime it is the last link in the chain of pain , as it were , the logical denouement when current hopelessness can set off the primordial primal hopelessness where death lurks and where suicide seems the logical step you may wonder how is it that hopelessness today sets off the same feeling created during birth ? it is again the chain of pain , the descending links between levels of consciousness it is known as resonance , where one feeling , which evolved out of similar feelings at earlier stages , ultimately triggers the earliest related feeling that was originally imprinted at the start of life i have written that it may be a specific neurological brain frequency that sets off the imprinted counterpart each deep feeling , such as hopelessness , matures and evolves onto higher brain levels where there are more advanced levels of consciousness thus the deep imprint becomes reflected in the same or similar feelings higher up conversely , in our therapy we start at the top , the last stage of the evolutionary chain , and work down the chain of pain to those earliest imprints normally the gating system keeps the brain from evoking those deeper levels but when one has undergone years of neglect and lack of love , the gating system falters then , a current frustration can set off profound feelings of hopelessness impressed deeper the brain here we may see violent act outs as those more powerful feelings are elicited it is why , for example , a student s current fear of failing in class can set off a full blown anxiety terror attack the manifestation of the feeling in the present gets amplified through resonance thus , the current feeling sets off the same deeper feelings until the whole system is engulfed in utter hopeless feelings and worse , there is no scene attached to it , since it is pure feeling , naked and unadorned , the exact same feeling from gestation and infancy , rising again to smother the person and make her suicidal it is the most profound hopelessness the current feeling has triggered its progenitor with sensations of approaching death becoming paramount when that feeling becomes excruciating one may want to kill oneself , just as the fetus infant had no other options the accompaniment of this hopelessness is nearly always lower body temperature , the parasympathetic nervous system dominance that early hopelessness is later expanded and ramified as the whole system and brain mature as each new brain system comes on line , it adds its emotional weight to the feeling but it is the same feeling with increased neuronal development it is that feeling that is the essence of depression as i explain in my extensive article on the subject , the mystery known as depression , it is the system s effort to suppress the feeling that produces depression so depression is not a feeling it is what happens as that feeling is blocked from higher level access and when we unravel depression that is what we find utter , unarticulated hopelessness and as it is felt and experienced with all of its pain , the depression begins to leave , at last this means that we must not trump evolution and experience the deep feelings too soon in therapy this happens when gating is leaky or faulty and it is here that for a time the patient must be given pain blockers to temporarily hold back resonance we are not blocking higher levels of expression , only that portion of the feeling that might be catastrophic if experienced too early inadvertently , i think this is what doctors are trying to do with their drugs sever the possibility of triggering off deeper pains for a time they are attempting to block resonance , though they may not even acknowledge that it exists yet , painkillers that work on lower levels are targeted precisely for that we can only feel those deep hurts as the body and brain allow current hopeless feelings first , then those from childhood and finally infancy , where the deepest feelings always lie i use the word compounding , because these are not different feelings they are the same feeling compounded the child just seems unhappy and sullen and no one knows why and certainly the child has no idea at all , nor do his teachers he is in the grasp of that early primordial , devastating feeling that no one can say or name it is literally ineffable so deep and overwhelming as to defy description what has this to do with self destruction ? let s take a literal example of destruction , cutting oneself this is a later ploy , making hurt obvious it is a plea for help please see my hurt see that i hurt this in lieu of screaming out that hurt and the cutter is not often aware of what she is doing or why it was never acknowledged by anyone because perhaps the parents had no idea of that hurt , or even that such emotional hurt existed there are many aspects of this for one patient , the feeling was , i m trying to let the hurt escape , even when she had no idea what it was she just knew it was inside and it had to come out in therapy , that is exactly what we helped her do let it out in methodical ways , so she no longer had to cut herself examples of self destructive behavior are myriad , but all the manifestations come from subdued feelings there are people who set themselves up for certain failure , who always make sure things turn out bad , who drink themselves into oblivion or who repeatedly get involved with a low life they know is bad for them here the driving forces are nearly always deep seeded pain but in the strict sense , a sense not in the psychoanalytic lexicon , these are secondary effects of imprinted hurt an example one patient in graduate school could not get feedback from his professors for a paper he turned in after weeks of trying to get through he sent a most nasty letter to the instructor for that , he was delayed in getting his degree so he shot himself in the foot self destructive because he could never get through to his father and also because he literally couldn t get through in being born being blocked from getting what he wanted and needed had set off a rage in him , and as we know rage is first line , brainstem originated it is the seat of the most atavistic anger possible he was helpless before this surge of fury resonance reached down and dredged it all up , surging beyond control he knew when he sent the letter it was wrong this is what used to be called emotional his emotions got the best of him they weren t irrational they were real but buried deeply in the news , there is story of a man who went on another mass killing spree , this time at a supposedly secure navy yard in washington , d c the shooter walked through the facility with a shotgun and calmly fired at defenseless people , killing twelve somewhere he might have known that it was suicidal but that was a faint force against his feelings a month before the rampage , the killer had told police that he was being followed by three people who were talking to him through the walls and ceilings of his hotel room and sending microwave vibrations into his body to deprive him of sleep in this case , we see clearly that the killer s feelings are so deep and so remote as to seem like a machine controlling his brain otherwise he would know it derives from deep in the brain it has been discovered that when such disturbed people hear voices , they really do and what those voices really say is , i hate here is the important point this man did not suffer a thought disorder if it were a simple thought disorder then it might be treated with more healthier thoughts i e , cognitive therapy but to believe it is a thought disorder means to ignore the evolution of the brain , to deny that there are lower levels with their own characteristics and functions to believe this means that the thinking cortex arrived de novo with no antecedents , and that it was not anchored anywhere in the brain it is considered by cognitivists as an entity unto itself these are the deniers of evolution , the creationists of the brain they might not agree to this characterization but there can be no other it is feelings that drive thoughts , in the here and now and in the history of the brain the killer suffers from a feeling disorder until we acknowledge that we will go on treating the wrong thing in the wrong way feelings have that great power in history , and when it comes to the brainstem , unleashed , it can lead to murder ideas , remember , are the last vestige of brain tissue that we can resort to feelings slop over boundaries and surge into the ideational brain where we manufacture ideas to match them the most bizarre come from the earliest imprints where they provide a terrible neuronal force that the cortex has to deal with when ideas no longer do their duty , a stroke cannot be far off how can we be so sure ? we see this in our therapy as deep feelings rise they can sometimes provoke strange ideas when we give patients medication that addresses mainly the lower feeling centers , the paranoid ideas may disappear for a time we would not think of attacking the ideas head on we address the underlying feelings , but again , only when they can be safely integrated indeed , when a patient is on the verge of a deep , heavy feeling , she may get paranoid transiently they are trying to suffocate me we know immediately where it comes from and can treat it post haste once our patients begin to relive deep brain imprint those paranoid ideas disappear so what are the self destructive people among us doing ? what and who a re they destroying ? the feeling self , the one with all the pain , but they are not destroying it , they are keeping it from destroying them drinking into oblivion seems self destructive but it is the person s means of keep pain under control suicide and self destructive behavior , then , are indeed two different things even though suicide attempts to destroy the self it is not , oddly , self destructive suicide means one final act it is not anything in the present that causes it it is the result of a deep memory and yes , if one could , then screaming it out could help temporarily , since it would relieve the pressure there are some acts of suicide that are a cry for help taking a certain amount of sleeping pills , for example and there are others that say , i really don t want to live anymore that is a jump off a bridge that is final , no call for help it all seems so helpless and hopeless they want to die for relief no more pain that s enough that s why the theme song from the television series m a s h rings with a profound kernel of truth suicide is painless killing oneself is not meant to be self destructive , per se it s meant to kill the pain , which has come to subsume the self in primal therapy , we get patients gradually down to those deep feelings that are so disturbing it takes time , but when they get there , they discover real relief , the kind that lasts and lets them live
