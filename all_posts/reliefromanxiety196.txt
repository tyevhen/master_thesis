how many times have you thought of yourself as a 'failure' or 'weak' because of your mental health ? and how many times have people made negative comments or hold negative stereotypes about mental health ? the answer is probably , many i expect most of us have spent our days searching for a reason why we have such conditions and i expect many of us have been in turmoil because we struggle to take part in activities like those around us let me tell you , it is not your fault you are not weak and you are not a failure to get through a mental health issue , is one the hardest things to ever tackle to be in a battle with your mind every day and to keep going shows great strength please , please do n't go thinking it 's your fault , because it 's not do n't ever let the opinion of someone else phase you , even though i know this is easier said than done the majority of the time , mental health is an inbalance of chemicals and thus an illness like any other i 'd like someone to take a step in your shoes and see how hellish some days can be , to see how strong you were that you managed to get out of bed , or how brave you were to put up your hand in class people need to begin to understand that mental illness is not something that 's asked for mental health is something that can kill , just like any physical illness and just because it ca n't be seen , does n't mean it affects people any less as the quote goes you do n't know what goes on behind closed doors yes the person may look fine on the outside , but they may be really struggling always ask someone how they 're doing let this remind you to keep going and to have faith best wishes , amy xx
