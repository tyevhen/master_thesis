okay , you know that max and i have coffee every morning with our favorite judge in hair curlers i may have neglected to mention that we are often joined by carol and her dog , prize , and sometimes even maria and her dog , nelly from to am , i host a dog party , a big dog party , a little dog party , good dogs , bad dogs , happy dogs , sad dogs this morning , in honor of the holiday season , prize arrived all decked out i kid you not max would never tolerate such a costume , but prize did n't mind and carol came bearing gifts , so all the more fun i'm not sure shrink rap or my three shrinks will look like over the next few days hoping to be off somewhere warm sometime soon , and clink has gone skiing roy , perhaps can be counted on to put up the last of our podcasts not the last ever , just the last one we did , a new improved one with the new mics and firewire mixer i feel like we need a new sidebar poll , and i'm tired of meds , so i 'll try something else the question is for you , whether you 're a shrink , a patient , or anyone else from all of the shrink rappers happy holidays !
