it 's been a long , strange month july started with beauty and serenity in colorado , melded into eternal days of disinterest and gray , before it crawled slowly up the slopes of relative normalcy the peaks and valleys of july replicate the peaks and valleys of depression depression is not a straight line illness it is a sine wave illness considering that fact , i guess july was n't so strange after all
