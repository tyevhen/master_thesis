this blog just completed its best ever days for traffic , page views i 've tried to figure out why certain posts went semi viral and others did n't here 's what i 've learned the most popular posts from jan to feb were how to write an opening sentence , page views are placebos really sugar pills ? , page views the serif readability myth , page views riddles have no place in job interviews , page views are you a javascript guru ? try this test , page views that 's not including my jan , post , how i fell in love with a schizophrenic , which got , page views is there a pattern here ? yes and no while there does n't seem to be a magic formula for going viral , i have noticed some factors that appear to be important two of the higher traffic posts of the last days the riddles post and are you a javascript guru ? had special appeal for developers , and i 've noticed in years past that developer oriented posts often do quite well i think it 's likely the serif readability myth post appealed to a wide variety of audiences , including graphic artists , webmasters , developers , and perhaps bloggers and writers in general out of all the blogs i did in the last days , this was the only one i predicted in advance would do well i told a friend i thought it might get , hits i was off by a factor of six controversial blogs often do well , so i was n't terribly surprised about the popularity of the serif readibility post nor the placebos post but again i was n't prepared for the magnitude of the response in either case what was the appeal of the new year 's day post ? probably the passion that went into it and maybe the novelty factor the biggest mystery , to me , is why how to write an opening sentence did so well over the past month , i 've written posts on writing tips i did n't think any of them would get a ton of traffic , and indeed , the median traffic for those was only around hits but for some unknown reason , people really flocked to the how to write an opening sentence post i still ca n't figure that one out three of the six biggest traffic blogs since jan were fairly long , words or more so i guess one generalization that might apply is longer blogs tend to be more likely to go viral or semi viral as i look back on the posts i 've done in seven years , i do notice that the more popular posts tend to be longish another thing i 've noticed is that whenever i get , or more visits to a single post , the visits tend to be direct analytics reveal that the top five referrers seldom account for more than percent of visits , and the long tail does n't explain the rest because it tapers off to nothing very sharply when a post is popular , analytics ca n't explain more than about a third of the visits i take this to mean that on a good day , two thirds of visits or more come by word of mouth yet another trend i 've noticed is that the more visits a post generates , the smaller the percentage that comes by way of search engines this again fits the hypothesis that viral or semi viral posts owe their viralness to word of mouth maybe that should be obvious after all , the very concept of viral implies word of mouth , does n't it ? normally i get about a quarter of my traffic from search engines on a viral day , that falls to between and bottom line , seo never plays a significant role in viralness not for me , anyway i 've never woken up one morning to find , views , and then seen that of the traffic came by way of search engines just the opposite if a post gets , visits i can be pretty darn sure search engines accounted for only or of visits that 's what always happens i 've never been a big believer in seo , in any case until recently , a typical day 's traffic for me was , visits , with around visits coming via search engines if i were to pay huge attention to seo , it 's possible i could double the number of search visits to that would give me , visits instead of , that kind of boost might be important over the long haul if my blog were the kind of blog where i was trying to monetize traffic via affiliate programs or by selling my own e books , or whatever but that 's not the kind of blog this is if i were getting a million visitors a month , i might want to try to monetize this blog , but with the kind of traffic i'm getting now even in the last days , i 'd rather not junk up the pages with ads for the sake of earning a measly a month or whatever one other thing i 've noticed is that viral blogs seldom happen over the weekend if you want people to see your blog in huge numbers , post on a tuesday , wednesday , or thursday so where do we stand , after all this ? here is my best advice , if you want to get a blog post to go viral or semi viral choose a controversial topic write with passion do n't post the blog on saturday or sunday craft a snappy headline try to engage developers aim for a longish post , words forget seo totally promote your blog via twitter , facebook , and other social sites promote the blog via reddit and other link aggregators those last two bits of advice have n't been worth a huge amount of traffic for me , by the way , even though i have a lot of followers on twitter only a tiny fraction of twitter followers are online at a given moment , and unless you tweet your blog six or seven times a day which i refuse to do you wo n't catch the eye of more than a few percent of your followers , and out of those you ca n't expect more than ten percent to go check out the blog that 's been my experience , at least i 'd be interested in hearing from others who 've had a different experience
