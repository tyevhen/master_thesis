these are the days when we 're trying to find some sense of routine again it 's the in between time the holidays are not quite over yet , we 're not quite ready to jump back into our school studies , but i'm starting to feel that obligatory itch to get back to normal oh , but i 'd quite like another week or two of break i'm quite enjoying the lack of routine , the break , the pause in a more rigid schedule i'm sure the kids would agree however , i have found in our seven years of homeschooling , that a routine of some sort is quite essential to a successful learning environment now , how that routine looks and plays out has changed quite a bit since those early days of learning i 've definitely relaxed in my style , looking at life itself as one big learning experience , desiring to slash the boundaries between learning and living tonight , on new year 's eve , we will go to my parents' for our annual new year 's eve celebration i will try to remain awake ah , the older i get the more difficult this becomes for me was it not for this little get together , i believe brad and i would be in bed long before midnight i see a nap in the forecast for my afternoon , something that i fear is necessary especially as i'm still quite down with this nasty cold virus but we will enjoy these last days of festivities and rest and relaxation , and somehow muster up the strength to get back to real life with gusto next monday oh , i'm not quite ready for that so i think i 'll just enjoy these last few carefree moments bayberry candles a new year 's tradition from mulberry antiques getting ready to cast on this pattern yarn from yarns by design enjoying a quick , easy bulky yarn knit pattern
