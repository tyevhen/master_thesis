out the whole mental health journey , i 've found losing myself as the hardest part i am no longer the person that i was because my mental health slowly deteriorated and took away the girl i once was , and this holds a pain that is almost unbearable i used to be seen as a bright and hard working student the 'perfect' student who was always doing well and reaped the rewards from her hard work but as my anxiety got hold , the grades began to drop and people no longer saw me as this mary poppins the very thing i took pride in was my education and it was slipping through my hands as i began to lose my education , i began to lose any lust for life i stopped driving lessons , seeing my friends and even leaving the house i was always a person that loved going out and exploring new things , but the worse i got , the harder it became to accomplish even the simplest of tasks as a child , i was always told that i woke up with a big smile on my face i always laughed and enjoyed myself but as depression set in , i could n't laugh anymore , i could n't smile and i could n't see any positivity i was no longer the smiling and optimistic girl even though it pains me to think about this , looking at this from a stronger standpoint has made me review myself as someone that is in reconstruction perhaps , this had to happen for me to come out of my shell and to experience new things i may never be that person again , but i am slowly improving and i think it 's for the better i am proud and almost somewhat accepting of my journey i know without the tackling of my anxiety , i would still be the old amy , stuck inside her comfort zone and now , i am in a much better place even though it is really difficult to tackle the things that scare me and the journey has been hell on earth , i am experiencing and enjoying life like never before , and i know without my anxiety journey , i would still be stuck perhaps , after years of losing myself , i am finally finding myself again a new version of myself too for anyone else who feels lost , it 's important to remember that this is a journey that is making you stronger you are in it now and rather than anxiety robbing you from what you have , you are beating it with all that you have and you are becoming better from it i know it 's hard , almost undesirably hard but you can do it best wishes , amy xx
