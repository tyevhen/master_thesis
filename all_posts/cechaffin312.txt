the sun is just lighting the east side of the redwood trees on this overcast morning i prefer overcast when depressed the sun seems an oxymoron i wonder if i can write anything more about clinical depression it 's been a rough ride my shrink added antipsychotics last wednesday , so i'm half stoned most of the time , though i care less about my deeds and misdeeds than otherwise still my crying spells and interior self denigrating thoughts persist i know this is depressive thinking , but it is not without merit to believe i have wasted my life that thought brings tears to my eyes , bringing up the chicken and egg conundrum where the sad thought induces the sad affect we 've been over that already and you know that i believe it is the sad affect which generates the sad thoughts i 've had all these years on disability with dreams of being a writer but no practical plan for marketing and making money from it i would like to make money , a lot of money , and i can say that for the first time in my life , an ambition that most us come to in our twenties i'm only thirty years late for that train , although a bad long term marriage with a non working wife and three children took their toll in alimony and custody nevertheless i always took money for granted and lived hand to mouth , save a few years i had some equity in my home my interests were always beyond money but nothing 's really beyond money unless you 're a monk and by not paying enough attention , i'm now in a position where money controls me , not the other way around if the flow stopped tomorrow kathleen and i would have to move into a tent since my disability was yanked in the fall of subsequently restored in december , although in the interim all my savings were taken by my first ex wife , i have been understandably paranoid about having no income tomorrow , which does n't help premature old age is another symptom of depression you start dwelling on penury and poor health and how will you get your medications and where will you live and such things you wonder how you will die cancer runs in my family and my cardiac risk is now low without the smoking but instead of making plans for today and smelling the flowers , you can only see the brown blooms of winter on the denuded rose bush here 's a poem from my first and only book i have stopped writing poetry a time to uproot it shot forth one thin stem from the waxed , purple stalks suddenly they yellowed , wilted , a sickness had taken hold i waited but no new shoot grew fine and green between the thorns while weeding one day i placed my hand around the branches , testing them a little , when the whole thing sprang into my clutch i inspected the roots an army of translucent termites was feasting on the soft wood , each a hideous jewel of pale yellow the bush left a wound in the ground , dark and pleading , a crumbling mouth i salved it as best i could with powdery white pesticide i'm working on my airport book thriller again so that it 's ready for the writer 's conference in august when i 'll have the opportunity to meet with agents it 's designed to be a page turner , though i dwell too much on conversation and character , i fear i stopped revising the eliot book for now to revise the novel , as it has more potential for earning money i was going to write about dogs and how i did n't like them today how they haul in every burr and frond into the house , how a house is impossible to keep clean with a big , hairy dog , how i hate the consistency and smell as i mix the wet food in with the dry food in the morning before i have my coffee , how i wonder when a long hair squats how fecal matter can possibly be spared from hanging from its fur which helps me understand why they cut off some dogs' tails for cleanliness , among other reasons i hate picking up their poop in public places , i hate waiting around while they sniff in circles making up their minds where to poop i do n't like sticking my fingers down my dog 's throat to make sure he swallows his medicine dogs are gross messy , stupid , smelly , and they demand a lot of care i love kenyon but i do n't like him as a dog i wish he had scales instead , that he were as clean as a lizard there , i 've said it i'm more of a cat person at heart they 're cleaner and smarter but you ca n't have nice furniture around them , and if they get mad and start pissing on things you 're in big trouble , as the scent is impossible to remove one last thing i do n't know if i shall continue this blog after its two year anniversary on july th i do n't know how much good it does me or anyone else it helps most when i'm very depressed and the act of writing takes my mind off myself for a while but today it 's just making me cry kilorats , ce
