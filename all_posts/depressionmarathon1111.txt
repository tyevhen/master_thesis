it s am , and i m awake i m not typically awake at am , but these are unusual days thinking at am , after too little sleep , is an interesting adventure fortunately , sometimes adventures are interesting and fruitful let me explain yesterday , at the suggestion of myself , i decided to write a gratitude list i thought that was a pretty good suggestion from an alcoholic momentarily sponsoring herself ! last night at a meeting , i spoke about taking people and things for granted my sleep deprived brain must have recalled that conversation this morning i was jolted with the realization that i d left one large er , huge item off my gratitude list yup , you guessed it , i forgot to list my sobriety sobriety how could i have missed that one ? ? yikes ! i don t ever want to take my sobriety for granted like relationships last night s topic , sobriety requires vigilance , awareness , and work sobriety is not for the faint of heart rarely have we seen a person fail those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program from alcoholics anonymous , pg cannot or will not completely as one of my old sponsors used to say , sobriety is not for wimps if i am to stay sober , i need to work my program completely i can t pick and choose i can t do it half assed if i want to stay sober i must remain willing , stay open to direction , and be unafraid to work fortunately , the big book also states , we are not saints the point is , that we are willing to grow along spiritual lines the principals we have set down are guides to progress we claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual perfection from alcoholics anonymous , pg i don t have to do this program perfectly to stay sober what a relief ! ! i need to follow the suggestions of the program and my sponsor i need to be of service to my group and my community i have to focus outside myself , and i cannot take recovery for granted if i do , i may suffer the fate of an old timer who spoke yesterday he had years of sobriety fortunately for him , after relaxing and taking it easy , he returned yesterday from a relapse to start again at day one
