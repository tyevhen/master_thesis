friday entry it is done three simple words that convey so much for me at first i was writing a book on coping strategies using technology to deal with adhd when that proved to be too large a project for me at that time , i began to update my depression ten ways to fight it off article then that , too , proved to be too much as i ve written before , i had given myself a large carrot to get the book on depression finished i promised myself i would let myself get my next haircut at my favorite , pricey salon when i finished the book i had just received a bad haircut , so i figured i had about six weeks to wrap things up before i looked shaggy then i got into a car accident by the end of may my life was still upside down , filled with trips to physical therapy and the chiropractor my hair was well beyond shaggy into unkempt then my oldest daughter suggested i keep the promise , but write something else since i had intended to release two blog books with the book on depression , i decided to switch projects again this time to my book on dealing with suicide from june to today i squeezed writing time in between continued therapy and freelance work today i typed the last word it is done since large carrots are so effective for me , and since my hair was driving me nuts , i decided to set up an appointment last week for today the gun to the head , so to speak here it is am and i finally finished my other daughter swore she d kill me if i cancelled , something i was prepared to do if i didn t finish i guess i m beginning to look embarrassing my hair hasn t been this long since the long hair days of the early s , and i suspect it is even longer hair i realize most guys cannot fathom why this was a motivating issue for me , but i have issues with tactile distractions i knew long hair would bug me the longer it grew , the more irritated i would become i chose well , though i never planned on a car accident drawing the process out so long i was very , very irritated it constantly drove me to write , but it still wasn t enough finally , i felt i had written enough that i could schedule the appointment and finish the book i knew having the appointment scheduled would pressure me to finish then i got a week long virus so much stress ! but i persevered the universe may not have wanted me to write this book , but i did next step is to compile it in scrivener and bring it to second draft status then i can send it out to an editor for input i m already thinking of my next project adhd can give us boundless creativity , but unbridled and it will run rampant through the garden of your mind in the end , you accomplish nothing as silly as this hair debacle has been , i m glad i did it d you might also like i determine to not be depressed and therefore i am not writing in a fishbowl day two i will survive i always do adhd fearing failure linkwithin
