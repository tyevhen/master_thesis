when i was in grad school u c davis in the late s , the bacterial world was simply the prokaryotic world , and vice versa there had n't yet come a distinction between eubacteria and archaea but now we know , or think we know , that prokaryota come in two fundamental flavors the true bacteria eubacteria , and the archaea primitive extremophiles if you were to want to count organelles mitochondria , chloroplasts , others as a third fundamental grouping , i suppose you could , with some justification at this writing , about distinct archaeal isolates , belonging to around genera , have been dna sequenced you can see a list of them by going to http genomevolution org coge organismview pl ? org desc archaea and looking in the organisms box you 'll see over organisms listed , but bear in mind they belong to only about genera most genera are represented by more than one species and or more than one isolate per species , in other words salt loving archaea species have been found growing in borax saturated desert ponds the species growing in this small lake produce a carotenoid pigment that gives the water a pink appearance the archaea were once thought to be exclusively anaerobes , but it turns out there are a couple dozen aerobic or facultatively anaerobic genera in the group in my own spare time research , i 've found that about of the sequenced archaeons all of them obligate anaerobes have a catalase gene catalase is the enzyme that breaks hydrogen peroxide down to water and oxygen oddly , very few of the aerobic archaea except for the halobacteriaceae group show any evidence of having catalase this is exactly the reverse of what 's expected in the rest of the living kingdom from bacteria to higher plants and animals , aerobes universally have catalase strict anaerobes do n't have catalase or at least , they are n't supposed to but see this post for some surprising exceptions this is a hugely unexpected finding many anaerobic archaeons have catalase , but not all aerobic ones do some enterprising grad student should tackle this and make a thesis project out of it in case you 're that student , here are some additional clues let 's back up for a second and look at the big picture no matter where on the tree of life you go , catalases come in only a few major types see the excellent review paper by chelikani , fita , and loewen for details for example , there are heme containing and non heme catalases most of the time , what we think of as catalase is heme containing catalase and yes , that means it contains iron in the heme containing group , you have monofunctional catalase as well as bifunctional catalase peroxidases or hydroperoxidases katg the monofunctionals come in big and small subunit varieties the biggies have subunits of kda or more and comprise just over base pairs of dna the smalls have subunits under kda and typically top out at base pairs here 's what you really need to know within the monofunctionals , there are three clades major subgroupings of catalase clades and are small subunit enzymes clade is primarily of plant origin and is relatively rare in bacteria the best known examples probably being katx of bacillus subtilis and catf of pseudomonas syringae clade takes in a huge number of catalases from bacteria , fungi , and various eukaryotes for clade , think staphylococcus catalase clade is the large subunit enzyme think e coli kate catalase the multifunctionals tend to be large over base pairs of dna the non heme catalases contain manganese instead of iron and are not your typical catalases let 's leave it at that what do the archaeons produce ? from what little probing i 've done , it seems the anaerobic archaeons that have catalase use a modified clade type of enzyme that has little in common with other clade catalases a few of the methane producers show good sequence agreement with bacteroides fragilis catalase , but most anaerobic archaeal catalases do not show good sequence concordance with any known eubacterial catalases so it 's entirely possible that a fourth clade of purely archaeal small subunit catalases unlike anything else in the plant or animal worlds awaits characterization the aerobic archaeons that have catalase are all halophiles members of the halobacteriaceae , and all have large subunit multifunctional peroxidases similar to those of the cyanobacteria mysteries waiting to be solved why is it the aerobes sulfolobus , pyrobaculum , and aeropyrum do not appear to have catalase ? is it that they do n't have catalase , or do they have some as yet undiscovered new type of catalase ? why is it that certain methane generating anaerobes e g , methanosarcina have clade catalases but the rest of the methane producing archaea have catalases that do n't match anything else in the living world ? did the former group get their catalases by way of horizontal gene transfer from anaerobic eubacteria ? did the multifunctional catalases of the halobacteriaceae originally come from cyanobacteria perhaps by way of plasmids ? what overlap , if any , exists between archaeal catalases and the catalases of algal chloroplasts ? if you find the answers to any of these , let me know !
