over the last couple of years i have started biting my tongue on occasion about every weeks these bites are not like taking a nip out of the tip of your tongue these bites are in the middle third of the tongue and when i bite into it there is a crunching sound and some excruciating pain most of the time i take a hunk of flesh out of the tongue and it bleeds a little when i checked with my neurologist about this problem , he said my jaw and tongue muscles are atrophying my wife tells me i need to be more aware of my chewing habits i did notice that many of these times i am chewing on a salad since beginning to take warfarin for my blood clot , my blood has thinned to a point where anything a scratch or cut , for example won t stop bleeding unless pressure is applied well , when i bit my tongue last wednesday , it would not stop bleeding pressure didn t seem to help ice seemed to help a little finally , pressure with a tea bag finally worked two hours later , however , it broke open again more ice , pressure and tea bags a week later the tongue is still swollen a little , but everything else seems back to normal and , i am listening to my wife like i always do okay , my fingers are crossed being someone who is normally pretty optimistic , very little gets me down for long i seem to have a way of turning negative events into a learning experience and find something positive about it but , this incident has me concerned if it was a more serious wound , or internal bleeding from a fall , for example , causing a serious sprain or broken bone , the situation might require immediate attention when i discussed this problem of biting my tongue with another kd r about my age , he mentioned he is also having this problem now i am wondering if more people living with kennedy s disease have this problem as their atrophy progresses please let me know if you are also experiencing this issue
