we participated in a peace march today monday we may participate in an illegal sit in at our congressman 's office we are finding routes to oppose this insane occupation do not call it a war below , a chinese brush experiment , a poem in which you can go forward and never back admittedly , more substantive than poetic but it 's what came out i read a couple of anti war poems at today 's rally in fort bragg , villanelles posted here some time ago retreat all you who prize success above wisdom , the lottery ticket over emptying the bedpan of your ailing grandmother , the one who taught you origami oh it 's all too much to ask now , half of our taxes for the military , happy consumers irritated by requests for funds to fight our unintentional genocide , poetry should have more metaphor and music but war is fractious and filled with dirty bombs whose exploding shrapnel embeds itself in breasts , faces , eyes , asses , democratically we sell these bombs imagine ! and spend billion dollars a year on war and another billion maintaining the military , us , a country with friendly neighbors and oceans for borders i am tired of telling the truth i am tired of saying the same words in different contexts do not be deceived , god is not mocked whatever a man sows , he shall also reap we sow global discord in the name of peace we praise slaughter in the name of stability we kill the innocent because we cannot find the guilty how elusive our enemies have proven ! snakes colored like fallen baghdad bricks wolves the color of snipers' robes lions the color of dust in the streets jackals below the radar of the righteous tragedy is loosed like a virus that reproduces for no reason , no reason except to harm and propagate the origin of the same mindless virus we ought to die we ought to surrender and tell the arabs we were children , we did n't understand the wisdom of their past millennium they invented chess , discovered astronomy , produced mosaic towers we ca n't reproduce , conquered the clueless west and converted most to a faith less hypocritical than papism this is not a poem , just a diatribe the middle east is beyond our wildest approximations of logic or prediction , of peace or chaos we must surrender , we must depart we must embrace the wisdom of acceptance accept our idiocy in ever invading accept the meaningless sacrifice of our troops accept the great mistake of pride and fear that drove us to attack , attack anything remotely connected to the leveling of our pride , the world trade center as if we owned the world ! as if our consumer driven culture were worth preserving , not a disease driven by greed and advertising , a culture of anti culture , a whore 's bed of merchandise good bye america , we tried to liberate you from your hubristic vision there is no hegemony the dollar 's fallen long live the yen come down , rapunzel your hair is tangled with barbwire your gown is made of kevlar apes swing on your braid congress nods and passes the simian agenda everyone is happy ! america , you grieve me ce
