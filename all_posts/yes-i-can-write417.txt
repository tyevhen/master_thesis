i do n't think i 've ever really talked on this blog about why i'm an anarchist , or what lead me to agree with that particular philosophy i 've only ever said that i am an anarchist ! so now i want to explain why i'm not really sure how to go about this in a logical manner , but i 'll try i 've been vaguely interested in anarchy for at least a year i think even longer , but i never believed it was a real possibility , a valid opinion i always just believed the commonly held opinion that anarchy can never work i thought it was an amazing yet entirely unrealistic ideal but then , i came across an essay on deviantart of all places that was very much anarchist anarcho primitivist to be exact , and brought up some very interesting points i commented on it , not all that positively , and got into an extremely long conversation with the author pretty quickly , my arguments melted away what he had to say made sense , and i was totally drawn to the ideas he expressed wanting to find out more , i asked for book suggestions , and he was happy to oblige his top recommendation was derrick jensen , and so i read his book the culture of make believe , and it rocked my world if you 've read any of my early posts , you 'll know just how much i love jensen that book broke my heart , and made me incredibly angry but even more then sadness or anger , i felt determination i could n't really identify as anything but anarchist after that now , you may be thinking i was to fast to change my opinions , or that i did n't research the other side , and i 'd say that is n't true as for changing opinions too fast , i 'd believed , in my heart , that anarchy was the right way to do things for a long time , id just never had that gut feeling backed up by anything definite before and as for looking at things from the other side , that 's impossible not to do in this society my entire life i 've seen the other sides view , and i hate it that 's why anarchy has always appealed to me since the culture of make believe , i 've read several other books by jensen , and numerous essays by numerous authors online i'm still sure that anarchy is the only political view that 's right for me and the earth i should make it clear that although jensen is an anarcho primitivist , i'm not i'm certainly leaning in that direction , but i do n't believe that a complete return to the hunter gatherer lifestyle is the only sustainable way of life i'm also not convinced that agriculture and domestication are bad things , i just think they need to be completely re thought i'm honestly not sure what little sub group of anarchy my views fit into there are a lot , but i'm definitely a collectivist , one who sees a world of sustainable communities and mutual support , not an individualist , which seems like a pretty cut throat every man woman for themselves type setup i envision a return to nature , in small , self sustaining communities , communities that love and support each other , and live in freedom and peace idealistic ? perhaps but if you never go for the ideal , and make do with well things could be worse this will do i guess , then things will never change ! i do n't want a world that could be worse i want a world that i'm actually proud to be a part of , one where i can hold my head high , and not be ashamed of everything i do , since everything , from eating to buying cloths to peeing in the toilet harms others how can that be right ? the main reason i'm anarchist is because i genuinely believe in freedom and respect for all beings , and for the the land itself no human , creature , tree or plant is a resource , or there simply for their usefulness to us each is an individual , and each deserves respect i suppose all i 've done so far is say why i'm against industrialized civilization , not why i'm against government so , why i'm against government is simple although it sounds corny , i really believe the old adage power corrupts , absolute power corrupts absolutely i do n't think it 's possible for someone in a position of power and control over others to not abuse that power in one way or another , even if they 're ignorant of that abuse themselves i believe that people can never be their own bosses until there are no bosses other than themselves i always used to scoff when i heard our civilization described as a machine i 'd roll my eyes and think the people who were saying that were idiots but now , i really understand the metaphor each individual , no matter what position they hold , is in a neatly fitted slot the people , wether they 're in positions of seemingly high importance or not , can change so easily , someone else fitting perfectly into that same slot each person really is like a tiny piece of a huge machine , and , just like machines , parts are easily replaceable , and the machine keeps on working since i became anarchist , or more realized that i was an anarchist , i really do feel like my eyes have been opened , and like i'm seeing things for the first time i no longer look at things the same way the mainstream does i see so many things , commonly accepted , almost never questioned things , that are so wrong ! there is so much irony , and so much insanity in our culture it never ceases to astound me what 's even more astounding is that so few people see it but then again , it took me years to start to realize , so i suppose it 's not all that surprising it 's hard seeing things in a way that 's so very far from the commonly accepted normal views , and i think i 'd go crazy if not for reassurance from books , people online , and my sister that i'm not the only one to see the fallacy of our entire civilization also , something that really helps when i get overwhelmed with all the negative stuff people think and say about anarchy , when i start to question whether i might be wrong on this one , even though i believe it whole heartedly , i just have to think about the fact that everyone knows that you ca n't learn anything without school then i laugh and the doubt goes away wow , that 's long and rather abrupt and disjointed , i'm afraid i thank you very much if you got this far ! i hope that made sense , and was n't to all over the map as always , comments and opinions are much appreciated ! peace , idzie you might also like the interconnectedness of life anti civilization , and what that means green anarchy boxed in linkwithin
