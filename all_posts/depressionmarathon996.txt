why bother with these now ? that 's where my brain goes when i feel good , especially when i feel good on vacation i'm here in colorado the air is clear my brain is clear i feel happy and free , so why take my medication ? how about just taking a break from my medication ? yes , that 's it , a break these thoughts are subtly compelling , provocative it 's hard not to pay attention , and i'm not sure i wo n't pay attention like i said , the thoughts are compelling i take eight pills every morning not all of them are for my depression it 's appealing to think of taking fewer or none at all i mean if i'm better , and if i'm in a place where i expect to continue feeling better , why not take a break and clean these 'toxins' out of my system of course , i know why because these 'toxins' are likely responsible for my current state without them i may not be sleeping at night or staying awake for the most part during the day without them i may not be working without them i may not be socializing without my meds i may not have been invited on nor felt well enough to make this trip of course , i know that unfortunately , that does n't make the thoughts any less compelling
