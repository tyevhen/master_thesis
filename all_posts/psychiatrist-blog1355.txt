addendum here is an old post on no shows which is a completely different phenomena than leaving early i 've vowed never to put real patient stories on the blog tonight , i'm saying , what the hell the following is not confabulated over the years , i 've been stood up for oh so many reasons martial arts class sticks out among them forgotten meetings , forgotten dates , forgotten children they 've all been reasons to forget a therapy session no one that i'm aware of has ever canceled an appointment at the last minute for a hair dresser 's appointment , but maybe i just do n't know today a patient left early why ? had to get those fantasy sports picks in this was a first roy would have passed over the iphone and been done with it i'm not so accommodating and i do n't have an iphone , g , g or otherwise i hate it when patients simply do n't show up and do n't call when i spend an entire session pacing back and forth to the waiting room and ca n't use my time if people opt out because life is busy and the choices are too many , i ca n't say i mind it 's their life , it 's their right to define priorities , as long as my time is n't wasted or someone else is n't left wanting for that session , then hey , fantasy picks , what can i say ? i'm not one for being judgmental or shoving down someone 's throat that therapy needs to be their top priority that 's for them to decide , especially in a long term therapy with a stable patient sorry , there 's no pro rating for judo class , fantasy sports , whatever life is busy and we all have to make choices sometimes i think people should cancel their sessions get your hair permed at a different time , but for someone who 's had trouble finding or maintaining employment , well they should cancel therapy sessions or schedule outside of work hours for the first few weeks of a new job gotta blow this crab feast for an hour the first week on the new job just does n't feel wise well , i hope my patient got the good players
