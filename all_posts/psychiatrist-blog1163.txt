okay , so i'm behind the times , here 's a cool post from midwife with a knife from months ago an interesting post on fertility , stress , and psychotherapy oh , and lemurs and monkeys and all kinds of critters , fertile and otherwise i'm even stealing her lemur photos i ca n't quite get the link right but it 's the post called are you reading my blog ? mwak asks how to tell stress susceptible people they may benefit from psychotherapy without making it sound like you think they are wusses her word , is n't it great ? ! what do you think ? i 've never seen anyone for a primary complaint of i ca n't conceive but i face this problem regularly with pain patients i'm left to say that some people 's depression gets funneled into their body as pain or physical symptoms , and it 's remarkable how treating the depression can alleviate the other symptoms i could have sworn i once wrote a post called you need a psychiatrist about how to talk to people about getting care without sounding judgmental , but i ca n't seem to find it must have been a dream so for tags we have pregnant pigs , bears , turtles , vultures , fish , glow in the dark cats , but no lemurs or monkeys what kind of blog is this anyway ?
