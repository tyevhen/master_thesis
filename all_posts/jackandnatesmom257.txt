i was trying to make this evening somewhat productive after the last few days have been a wash we have been in lockdown basically since the dr brenner appt which makes me highly suspicious that this is where we picked up the bug , and i have n't had a chance to sort through all of the supplement medication changes we made i did get a chance to research them , verify doses , and order the best possible formulations , the ones that were not prescriptions anyway it was funny , when i took nate in to be tested for flu , i brought our regular pediatrician the note that dr brenner always gives me to give to her as communication and she said jenny , i'm a doctor and i ca n't read this one worst thing was i had had to call both the local pharmacy and our compounding pharmacy and ask about all of the prescriptions he sent in before i could decipher the word she was pointing to carnitor now if a nurse and a doctor ca n't read your handwriting that 's pretty bad i 'll cut him a break , he sends hand written notes to our primary pediatrician he gets major points for that so anyway , i started by just writing out exactly what i am expected to get into these boys and that is as far as i have gotten too overwhelmed i need a new plan had n't realized how much we were up to like i said , it just crept up on me and this is also with stopping things that did n't seem to be working here is our current list this is a good reference spot for me guarantee i wo n't lose this probiotic nate tsp qd jack tab qd calcium tsp qd msm grams day scoop pp nate mg tid zinc mg day cap gaba jack mg tid curcumin nate scoop qd miralax jack scoop day inositol jack mg tid scoop fluconazole ml qd clonidine jack mg qhs leucovorin mg x week carnitor tsp bid vitamin c tsp qd speak smooth fish oil vitamin e tsp qd methyl b shots nate x wk jack x wk transdermal glutathione ml x d gasp i gotta find me a schedule , or a way to sneak an ng tube in while the boys are sleeping every night seriously , is it just me , or is this just obscene for kids who do n't swallow pills yet ? well jack actually can swallow small ones now , but i am not pushing my luck actually maybe i should ugh help !
