you may have been wondering where i 've been i was hospitalized wednesday night i did n't want to go i did n't want to be there , but it was the safest , most sane place for me to be while inpatient , i had no access to a computer , so no updates for you and no therapeutic writing for me i got out of the hospital yesterday just in time to drive to my boyfriend 's home for his family christmas party it was a huge affair with too much food , lots of people and an equal amount of revelry it was very fun , albeit a bit overwhelming but it was a great distraction from the misery of the past few weeks the plan is to return home tomorrow and begin outpatient ect treatments on tuesday i will likely end up doing treatments , just as i did last spring again , this is not where i wanted this relapse to take me , but it is the only option left to deal with the pain i 've been in unfortunately , ect treatments will put me in a world of hurt financially , as i will not be able to work for perhaps up to weeks i'm going to be a rebel and try to get in a few days here and there , but i do n't yet know if that will be possible i am also not allowed to drive , and therefore i will need to negotiate rides everywhere there are many other issues , including telling my work and explaining things to d , but i 've only got time for the above update right now as usual , i will appreciate any prayers and support during this incredibly difficult time
