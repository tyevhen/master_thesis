many people ask where the name kennedy s disease came from i found an updated explanation recently on medscape that you might find interesting kennedy disease kd is named after william r kennedy , md , who described this entity in an abstract in the full report followed in the history of this entity is summarized briefly here by way of a personal memoir from dr kennedy to the author three months after completing his residency in neurology at the mayo clinic in , dr kennedy examined a year old man of french and native american ancestry from minnesota who had been having problems with weakness for over years at that time , dr kennedy had just taken a faculty position at the university of minnesota where he has remained for his professional career other affected family members were identified , and an extensive pedigree developed dr kennedy recalled , this was an exciting patient ! as a resident i had reviewed the entire mayo clinic film collection of patients , and every muscle and nerve biopsy taken before , but i had not encountered this disease i thought i knew how to document this patient but i had never performed a muscle biopsy , had never photographed a patient , and had never used a motion picture camera two months later , a similar patient , a year old man from iowa , was referred for evaluation again , the patient 's family history was positive , and dr kennedy noted that this patient 's clinical picture closely resembled that of the previous patient evaluation of both families included his loading an electromyograph emg into a car and driving to iowa the present author had a similar experience when evaluating another affected family with dr kennedy in northern minnesota in performing clinical evaluations and emg in the field is challenging work dr paul delwaide , a belgian neurologist , first used the appellation kennedy disease in a paper in the author 's discussions over the years with dr kennedy , he tended to downplay the use of eponyms for diseases when the author recently asked him again about his disease , he admitted that now , as he grows older , it feels kind of good in , harding et al reclassified the disease as x linked bulbospinal neuronopathy to reflect the sensory conduction abnormalities noted in several of their cases although the concept of the disease has been broadened , it remains an x linked disorder with the hallmark of progressive weakness of the limb and bulbar musculature additional neurologic features include sensory abnormalities , tremor of the upper extremities , and a quivering chin a number of patients also have various endocrinologic abnormalities , such as diabetes , testicular atrophy , gynecomastia , oligospermia , and erectile dysfunction in , fischbeck et al reported the genetic defect to be at the dxys marker on the proximal long arm of the x chromosome this was later characterized as an expanded tandem cytosine adenine guanine cag repeat in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene
