tastes great , less cancer the scientific literature unequivocally shows that menthol cigarets cause less cancer than ordinary cigarets , and yet this information which could save lives , obviously is being withheld from the public by fda , which conducted some of the research nci estimates that , americans will die of lung cancer in about of those deaths will be smoking related if the scientific studies are right , around , lives per year would be saved in the u s alone if smokers converted to menthols for the past two years , authorities in the u s and the european union have been trying to vilify menthol cigarets in preparation for pulling them off the market there 's only one problem the scientific literature shows that menthol cigarets are less hazardous than non mentholated cigarets in a paper in the journal of the national cancer institute lung cancer risk among smokers of menthol cigarettes , researchers found in multivariable analyses adjusted for pack years of smoking , menthol cigarettes were associated with a lower lung cancer incidence or , ci to and mortality hazard ratio of mortality , ci to than non menthol cigarettes or means odds ratio and ci is confidence interval in another recent study involving , smokers , reported in nicotine and tobacco research , oct , fda 's own brian rostron concluded we found evidence of lower lung cancer mortality risk among menthol smokers compared with nonmenthol smokers at ages and over in the u s population the mortality risk was n't just slightly lower for smokers and older it was lower the fact that mentholated cigarets do n't cause more cancer is n't by itself surprising since menthol is not carcinogenic the protective effect of menthol is what 's surprising but even that is n't hard to figure out inflammation is known to play a role in the development of cancer and there is good evidence that anti inflammatory substances like ibuprofen have cancer preventive properties menthol is strongly anti inflammatory , especially for lung tissue fda is killing people by not disseminating this information the fact that menthol cigarets are to less cancer causing than regular cigarets the food and drug administration is essentially letting people die needlessly it 's fair to ask why the most likely answer is that it 's politically incorrect to say that one type of cigaret is safer than another it goes against the government anti smoking agenda but fda 's mandate is to protect the public so there 's little justification for withholding information from consumers about products that are known to be less deadly than other products sure , the information is technically public but how many consumers take the time to dig through the scientific literature ? should they even be expected to ? fda has an obligation to tell people which cigarets are safest especially when the toxicity difference is significant up to , according to fda 's own research but will menthols be banned ? it does n't appear menthols will be banned any time soon in the u s on march , , the tobacco products scientific advisory committee an advisory panel to the fda concluded that removing menthol cigarets from the market would benefit public health in the united states but stopped short of recommending that the food and drug administration take any action , probably to avoid stirring racial tensions the congress of racial equality , the national black chamber of commerce , the national organization of black law enforcement executives , and the national black police association have all urged the fda not to ban mentholated cigarets , based on fears that such a ban would only create a vibrant underground market in illegal cigarets , sending more african americans to prison menthols are known to be more popular among african americans than among whites europe is a different matter it appears increasingly likely that the eu will succeed in getting menthols and slims and vanillas taken off the market by in december , the european commission put forward a proposal that would ban all flavored cigarets as well as packs containing fewer than the usual sticks the new measures would also require pictorial and other warnings that cover of the surface area of every pack of non flavored cigarets as i reported yesterday , lung cancer rates among smokers have soared at such a rapid rate in recent decades specifically , from on that scientists are now at a loss to explain the increase lung cancer rates among u s smokers went up fold from to in the same time period , per capita cigaret consumption only doubled researchers have tried but failed to explain what 's going on we do know one thing for sure , though menthol has nothing to do with it
