hi friends ! sorry i 've been missing we are busy battling colds here ugh ! i was hoping we could avoid the common cold during these first few months of paige 's life no dice ! chris is almost done with it and i'm in the middle of it paige had the lightest case of it , but there was still a few days of suctioning out her nose with the bulb syringe and letting her sleep upright on my chest or in the vibrating chair i was so paranoid and scared she would choke on her mucous ick she seems so much better now and i got a little more sleep last night as did chris ! grandma carty came by to help for a few days which was heaven ! i got lots of little things done while she doted on little p and took good care of her grandpa carty joined in toward the end and put in lots of good quality time with the li'l schnook too chris and i even made it out on saturday night to the wedding of a friend ! i had the worst hormonal pull i felt like i would cry toward the end of the dinner that night because i felt this need to rush home to her i missed her terribly it hit me like a ton of bricks but , we made it through most of the evening and she was safe and sound at home last week she went to the month doctor visit and she measured over rd percentile in height and th percentile in weight her head circumference is tiny , so i guess they are going to keep an eye on it looks like she 's taking after her daddy more and more he 's very tall foot inches and his head measures a bit smaller than mine that is no reference to his brain size , mind you , he 's a smartie so , that 's the news here ! hopefully i can share more soon , especially when we are feeling better ! i at least wanted to update you and say hello ! i hope everyone is doing great ! save you might also like before and now couch potato hello linkwithin
