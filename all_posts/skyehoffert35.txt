i just found out yesterday that , the five enchanted rose 's contest will be announcing the winners february st instead of march st i panicked a bit , i feel equal amounts of excitement and dread i must admit that i really want to win , but then again what contestant 's does n't , at the same time i am having crippling self doubt that tells me there is no chance for me so while i battle my own mind i thought i would share some snippets of my entry because with this contest i will either lose the rights to it , or my ability to even look at it without contempt i know i need to learn how to deal with defeat , but probably not today hell 's teeth , do you always talk this much ? william aka the beast you shall be paid in gold , from a brief stint into the craft that is alchemy , i have more than i shall ever have want i held the shimmering coin up to the light , a cheap parlor trick i'm sure i refused to be impressed by him , his pride was already equal to that of two men william and belle he merely nodded in return , i thought you could join me for tea he gestured to the bench and i sat on the other end leaving a noticeably large space between us a teapot appeared in the air , followed by a small china cup steam dissipated as the tea was poured by invisible hands i looked to william but he had n't moved he held his book up , unbothered his gaze slid my direction and his lips quirked at the corner , sugar ? he asked in all innocence william and belle his pupils had grown nearly taking over the green in his eyes his skin was unnaturally pale he flicked his tongue over his teeth and groaned , bloody hell , am i a vampire ? i was speechless he snapped his fingers and a scone appeared in his hand , he took a bite and spat it , ash , it 's ash ! he sniffed the air and his eyes flicked to black then back to green it 's a lucky thing for you that we had tea first , your blood is ever so enticing darling william that 's not how it is supposed to go , i said looking up at him with a tearful smile quite , he said , pressing his lips to my forehead belle and william i suppose i should tell you that we lived happily ever after , but ours was never a fairytale belle fun fact , i tried pickled herring to day and despite it 's name and appearance i like it , it 's actually fairly sweet well i'm off to try and distract myself from the idea of losing ta , ta
