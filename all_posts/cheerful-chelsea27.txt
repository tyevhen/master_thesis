i'm always anxious when attending any kind of doctor , dentist or optician 's appointment however , i used to find it a lot easier to get through them when they started asking their seemingly endless list of personal questions they used to be able to look at my age and assume that i was a student , which for many years was correct i can no longer give myself that label without being a fraud , and lets not get started on how uncomfortable and flustered i feel when they ask if i'm a graduate ! nowadays i seem to choose one of a few responses what i say usually depends upon the kind of mood i'm in and is based on how confident i'm feeling that day i might say that i'm a writer which tends to prompt the follow up question of what do you write about ? or who do you write for ? someone once assumed that i wrote manuscripts ! sorry pal i'm not all that showbiz i usually feel fairly comfortable saying that i write about mental health more often than not the conversation will end there , a lot of people clam up and find it awkward to talk about on some occasions i'm not quite confident enough to say that i'm a 'writer' , it sounds strange to me yes i write , but can i call myself a 'writer' ? it 's not my occupation , it 's more of a hobby and self help method for dealing with my past problems , current feelings and experiences with mental illness even being honest and saying i'm a blogger can cause some people to recoil , as if they think oh here 's another wannabe writer trying to earn a quick buck or anyone can create a blog these days , no biggy you 'd be right to think that those are just assumptions i 've made , but bloggers do receive that kind of feedback regularly journalists and writers often see bloggers as a modern form of competition i just think it 's a fantastic platform to share opinions , help people and potentially launch careers from on the days i'm really feeling down and feeling particularly useless in the world i 'll say i'm un employed at this time it 's easier and provides an immediate end to that topic of conversation companies must love me messing up their records as it 's likely that over the years i will chop and change my answer depending upon how i'm feeling perhaps one day i 'll be able to confidently say that i'm a writer i'm definitely not saying that bloggers are n't 'writers' , if you believe in yourself and are happy to declare yourself as such , good for you ! personally i do n't think it matters if your answer varies so long as you are n't pretending to be a doctor , attempting fraud or meddling with your taxes simply answer in the way that makes you feel most comfortable afterall , those dentist check ups are only once a year do n't sweat it !
