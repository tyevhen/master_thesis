i need to de stress , big time lately , i 've been extremely negative , tense , anxious , and angry the latter is troublesome , as i'm lashing out over the stupidest things like my dsl being down i 've been way too high strung , and that certainly is n't helping me to be less anxious worse , i 've been so busy at work , putting in to hour days , that i simply have n't found time to relax tonight that 's the priority !
