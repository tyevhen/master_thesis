i ve been taken to task on occasion by readers leaving comments who simply can t believe the advice i give they ve accused me of not really having any problems to deal with in the first place , or of being deluded into thinking i ve actually conquered some of these issues , or they ve left happy little comments then blogged about how insane i am it has always made me a bit sad not for the usual reasons , mind you , but because these are the very people i m trying to help out through sharing my life experiences instead , they have their hands over their ears shouting i m not listening ! my cognitive behavior therapist assures me that is a very common thing for analysts to hear that s too hard i can t do that other people may have told you they could do that , but they re lying it s all bush s fault fortunately , most of the commenters have not been of that variety and in fact have been fairly receptive to these ideas , but what i say flies in the face of a lot of people then again , who am i really ? i m just this blogger well , i m going to work through a problem today right here on these pages to prove my technique works i m ticking that slow sort of tick today where i can t connect my lips to the thoughts racing in my brain i m speaking in slow motion , actually , which would make home schooling my daughters comical if it wasn t so tragic what s funny is that i can still type at wpm i bet i could type my comments to the girls and have my computer read the comments faster than i could say them neurological problems are so weird at any rate , i m not typing here to prove how sagacious i am instead , i m trying to follow point of depression ten ways to fight it off let s begin i ve got these bone growths in my mouth that i want checked out they re like a second set of teeth growing sideways on the inside of my lower teeth things get stuck under them all the time chips , really large peas , awkward sentences it can be quite painful so i set up an appointment with a specialist sometime last century finally , the time for the appointment came and he rescheduled that s ok i could wait another week then i discovered i was doubled booked ok , another week dutifully my pda reminded me of the upcoming event the specialist s office dutifully reminded me of the upcoming event then i awoke this morning with poor equilibrium , my right leg marking beat to unheard music , and my head in a fog i didn t realize i had missed my appointment until minutes past , not that i could have done anything about it had i remembered in time one phone call later and i have a new appointment one month away embarrassing frustrating then i felt it my old friend , mr depression sometimes he just pays me a visit out of the blue he likes to drop by , sit on my couch , and take over the remote control most of the time he just drops by after i ve screwed up having ad hd makes that a common enough occurrence , but in the past , however , he d stay for weeks having evicted him already from my life i couldn t afford to let him back in so i did what i always do i fought him off first , i said no , out loud i don t really believe there is a mr depression , obviously if i did then this blog would be about a totally different spectrum of problems i couldn t call it a beautiful mind perhaps manky mind would suit better but i digress shouting in the face of adversity steels my resolve it s silly , but it works so i don t knock it then i need to find something constructive to do i chose to dive into home schooling while simultaneously writing this very article it was just the sort of sensory bombardment i needed to send mr depression packing better yet , i never even answered the door now , i ve spent years developing this technique so some of you may boggle at such fortitude the ones who don t suffer from depression will wonder what i m going on about and the ones who do suffer from it may very well think it s impossible to do i promise you , it is not but it s not easy , either yesterday my five year old had to come with me to my cbt appointment i tried to keep her set up with a pair of headphones , a disney movie , and my ibook , but it was still hard to focus my therapist , who has ad hd , commented on how it took some doing but he could now play the tv in the background to keep li l tikes busy while he counseled somebody i just shook my head i couldn t imagine doing that in fact , i had to ask him to shut off his screensaver because i couldn t stop seeing it out of the corner of my eye but with practice i know that one day such things won t trouble me wow , just think in another twenty years i can filter out background noise if i work really hard at it it s so depressing no , wait , somebody s at the door again it better not be who i think it is
