ok , so today he said waffle clear as day , to the point that john and i went running down the stairs as fast as possible to make said waffle happen his babbling is sounding more like words a lot more i want , i do n't want , go often we ca n't understand the end of the phrase , but the intent is certainly there , this evening i took his desk dungeon as i like to call it because there is no escape , so he has to focus to his room i feel guilty making him do more structured activity after he is gone from until almost in structured settings , but sometimes mama needs to do a little checking up of her own i smell some major progress in the last month we have a color sorting peg board and he was definitely sorting them appropriately by color , with some complaining in between he was doing pretty well matching bears thanks jo and was doing really well with his m d shape puzzles as well he 's pretty good with puzzles in general once i freed him , he played with me pretty appropriately with his elephant ball popper and car ramp it was what i would call productive play time , aka i did n't have to barricade him to make him play maybe this video will give you a bit of an idea of the improvement in his interaction since about a month and a half ago i 'll put the old one first , then tonight 's today
