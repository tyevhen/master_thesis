sally satel is a psychiatrist who has strong , and sometimes controversial , opinions she has a terrific article in monday 's new york times to fight stigmas , start with treatment she talks about a reality tv show i 've never seen one of the many called how mad are you ? the premise ten people , with psychiatric disorders and without are put together for a week and pushed to the brink psychiatrists reviewed the tapes and could n't tell who had psychiatric disorders and who did n't this is a surprise ? some people are obviously psychiatrically ill they behave in disruptive ways , do n't attend to their hygiene , respond to stimuli that are n't there meaning they 're obviously hallucinating and responding to those hallucination , but , as dr satel points out , often they are untreated or sometimes their treatment has side effects that are visible , such as tremors , or with the older medications , parkinsonism this is n't the majority of people with psychiatric illnesses go into any gathering of normal looking people and take a poll i assure you that some if not many of them will have had some type of treatment with either a psychotropic medication or psychotherapy at some point in their lives people with psychiatric disorders just do n't look different from others and people with a past history of psychiatric disorders are not necessarily fragile human beings this is something i tell my patients when you 're better , you 're better , you do n't need to live a sheltered life and people do n't have to protect you from every little stress yes , there are some people who are fragile , and some people who need sheltering but not everyone so dr satel tells us that public service campaigns to destigmatize mental illness do n't work what does work ? she writes if how mad are you ? improved viewer attitudes , the credit should go to treatment , the most effective destigmatizing force there is imagine poor psychotic souls cowering in doorways , shuffling along in stinking rags or arguing loudly with themselves in the park no public service announcement will make the public less fearful of them or reassure prospective neighbors when a group home for the mentally ill wants to settle on their block altering public attitudes toward the mentally ill depends largely on whether they receive treatment that works this , in turn , sets in motion a self reinforcing momentum the more that treatment is observed to work , the more it is encouraged thanks to kelley who sent the link to this article
