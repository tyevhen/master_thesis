rules each blogger must post these rules first each blogger starts with random facts habits about themselves blogger that are tagged need to write on their own blog about their things at the end of your blog , you need to choose people to get tagged and list their names do n't forget to leave them a comment , telling them that they 've been tagged and to read your blog ok i was tagged by smorgan , so here goes ! i'm often more comfortable around people slightly younger than me , not because i'm young for my age or anything like that , but because i have this huge fear of being judged by people , and somehow that feeling is stronger with people my own age and older like somehow i'm expected to get along with them since they 're my age , so there 's more pressure makes no sense , i know p i stay up super late , even when i'm really tired , just because i really do n't want to go to bed there has only ever been one person outside of my immediate family who has seen the real me in my entirety , and i do n't think that person even knows they have ! i'm extremely honest i'm not trying to brag or anything , i just tend to be really honest and very straightforward that 's gotten me in trouble more than once i find people absolutely fascinating , and even though i'm an introvert , i love being around them as long as i'm with at least one person i know and trust , i'm happy i no longer use make up i went through a stage where i always wore it , but now i feel i'm comfortable enough to not i'm extremely protective of my sister i will kick the ass of anyone who dares to mess with her ! i sing very often and none too well , as i'm sure my family will tell you i mostly sing punk songs , and my voice is totally not suited to that p now i'm supposed to tag people hmmm i ca n't think of , but i 'll tag as many as i can emi mom aka debbie sheila stella rochelle signe hannah yay ! nearly anyway , i'm planning on a big post with tons of getting ready for christmas photo 's tomorrow , so stay tuned for that ! peace , idzie you might also like i was tagged , so photo tag trips and ukuleles and anarchists , oh my ! the year linkwithin
