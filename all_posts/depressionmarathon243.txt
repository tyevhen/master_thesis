my big news today is i ran miles this morning it 's below zero here , so i ran it on the treadmill i focused on running it one mile at a time , with one minute walk breaks at each mile with a minute warm up and cool down , i was on the 'mill for minutes and while it was tough , i actually felt pretty good ! i was quite pleased my right hip did get sore , but it was muscular soreness , which does n't concern me as much as joint soreness would i know my hip muscles are weak i 'll keep working on that my hip joint felt good though , and it still does hours later that pleases me , too i really did n't know what to expect when i got on the treadmill i worked two long days on friday and saturday , and i was totally wiped out last night i slept fairly well overnight , but my energy as i stepped on the treadmill was still pretty low nonetheless , i knew i wanted to run long i had a plan , and i stuck to it i'm so glad it worked out well i'm grateful to be running again starting over after my three month layoff has not been easy i knew it would n't be i'm trying to stay positive through the tough , heavy runs having a quality run like i did today , with my legs churning and my breathing controlled , is medicine for my soul i am a happy soul right now
