if you follow my blog , you know that finding acceptance is why i started writing these articles and continues to be what i am searching for today acceptance , in my opinion , can take many forms what i am writing about today will use the serenity prayer for the basis of my thoughts god , grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change , courage to change the things i can , and wisdom to know the difference accepting that i have kennedy s disease was easy dna tests confirmed that i had the defective gene and , because i had two brothers already diagnosed with kennedy s disease , denial was out of the question accepting that i cannot change what kennedy s disease does to my motor neurons and muscles was more difficult and cost me earlier in life how much it cost is still up for debate , but there was a cost in those days i was unaware that over exercising can do more harm than good i felt that if i worked even harder on weight and cardio training that i would be stronger and the atrophy would be less noticeable boy was i wrong changing what i can took me several more years in fact , i am still changing things it all began with my smart exercise program it changed my life for the better , but i was still missing something later , a physical therapist who had experience with degenerative disorders designed an even better exercise program that i am still using today beginning to take dutasteride was a shot in the dark i went with the recommendations of a neurologist and researcher who i respect , but did not have a clue as to what the results would be positive and negative fortunately , the last fifteen months have been very positive and possibly the best year of my recent life in regards to managing and minimizing the progression courage is a good word to explain my journey , because making these changes did not come easy fortunately , i keep a journal and this helps me review and understand what works and what doesn t wisdom to know the difference is what i am still working on today there is a fine line between accepting and giving up or in to something i never want to give up or give in i want to go down fighting in fact , i need to go down fighting but , i need to be smart about it also for example deciding to use a wheelchair as my primary mobility device was difficult , but necessary when i learned what might happen to me if i had a bad fall again it took courage to make that change , but i believe it made a major difference in my life living in fear that the next fall might cripple me for life is no way to live as this health condition continues to progress , i need to continually review my capabilities and the options available to me fortunately , i have an understanding and smart wife who continually challenges me to be consider the options and encourages me on she is a blessing in my life
