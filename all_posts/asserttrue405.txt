the question of how organisms develop entirely new genes is one of the most important open questions in biology one possibility is that new genes often develop through accidental translation of antisense strands of dna an example of this can be seen with the s protein of the s bacterial ribosome if you take the amino acid sequence for an s gene and use it as the query sequence in a blast p protein blast , you 'll mostly get back hits on other s proteins , but you 'll also get minor low fidelity hits on polynucleotide phosphorylase why ? when you do a blast search , the search engine , by default , looks at both dna strands of target genes sense and antisense strands to see if there 's a potential sequence match with the query if there 's a match on the antisense strand , it will be reported along with sense matches in the case of the s protein , blast p searches often report weak antisense hits on polynucleotide phosphorylase in addition to strong sense hits on ribosomal s ribosomal proteins are , of course , among the most highly conserved proteins in nature it turns out that polynucleotide phosphorylase pnpase is very highly conserved as well it 's an enzyme that occurs in every life form bacteria , fungi , plants , animals , absent only in a scant handful of microbial endosymbionts that have lost the majority of their genes through deletions while the chemical function of pnpase is well understood it catalyzes the interconversion of nucleoside diphosphates to rna , its physiologic purpose is not well understood , although recent research shows that pnpase knockout mutants of e coli exhibit lower mutation rates hence , pnpase may actually be involved in generating mutations the bacterium rothia mucilaginosa , strain dy , has a putative pnpase gene at a genome offset of when this gene is used as the query for a blast p search , the hits that come back include many strong matches for the s ribosomal proteins of various organisms by strong match , i mean better than sequence identity coupled with an e value expectation value of zero recall that the e value represents the approximate odds of the match in question happening due to random chance if we use the genome viewer at genomevolution org to look at the pnpase gene of rothia mucilaginosa , we see something extraordinarily peculiar look carefully at the graphic below click to enlarge the following image , or better yet , to see this genome view for yourself , go to this link notice the presence of overlapping sense and antisense open reading frames on a portion of dna from rothia mucilaginosa the top reading frame contains the gene for polynucleotide phosphorylase the lower strand reading frame contains ribosomal s to see this in your own browser , go to this link notice that there are overlapping genes on the top strand is the gene for pnpase on the bottom strand , in the same location , is a gene for ribosomal s these are bidirectionally overlapping open reading frames , something occasionally encountered in virus nucleic acids but rarely seen in bacterial or other genomes how do we explain this anomaly ? it could be just that an anomaly , two open reading frames that happen to overlap but that are n't necessarily translated in vivo or it could be that at some point , many millions of years ago , the ribosomal s gene of a rothia ancestor was erroneously translated via the antisense strand , producing a protein with pnpase characteristics we do n't know why pnpase confers survival value its physiologic purpose is not fully understood , but we do know , with a fair degree of certainty , that pnpase does , in fact , confer survival value because every organism , at every level of the tree of life , has at least one copy of pnpase once rothia 's ancestor , through whatever process , opened up a reading frame on the antisense strand of ribosomal s , the reading frame stayed open , because it conferred survival value in this way , the first rothia pnpase was born arguably at some point in its history , rothia duplicated its pnpase gene and placed a new copy at genome offset over time , this second copy diverged from the original copy , becoming more like e coli pnpase which is also to say , less s like rothia 's second pnpase shows a blast p similarity of in terms of aa identities to e coli pnpase , with e value e it shows a blast p similarity of aa identities with e coli ribosomal s e value e neither e coli pnpase nor rothia pnpase overlaps an s gene however , both are colocated with the ribosomal s protein gene and you 'll find if you look at lots of bacterial genomes that pnpase is almost always located immediately next to an s ribosomal gene rothia pnpase is an example of an enzyme that may very well have started out as an antisense copy of another protein the s ribosomal protein of course , the mere presence of bidirectionally overlapping open reading frames does n't prove that both frames are actually transcribed and translated in vivo but the fact that blast p searches using pnpase as the query almost always turn up faint s echoes in a wide variety of organisms is highly suggestive of an ancestral relationship between the two proteins
