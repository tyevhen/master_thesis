yesterday i blogged about this blog , in my th post , and today i want to take a temporary detour i 'll get back to more serious fare soon to add to the chatter about blogs in general by addressing the oft asked question is blogging dead ? my first reaction is to ask , semi facetiously was it ever really alive ? paul krugman makes the case that bloggers still serve critical roles in politics , for example , and other niche knowledge domains kevin drum gives a good overview of what i call the conversational theory of blogging , which to me is just theory , because most blogs have no comments and no conversation but drum 's bigger point is that the conversations have all now moved to facebook and twitter which we all know being a natural born heckler , i 'd make the point that there 's little real conversation going on there , either was the web ever really about conversations ? that 's the question it seems to me if we 're going to take the pulse of blogging , we might want to take a look at the term blog on google trends while not a definitive proof of anything , this graph does seem arguably to show interest in blogs peaking in and trailing off since then if we go to alexa com and look for stats on blogspot com , we see this shows that blogspot com which is google 's blog platform , of course a platform it bought in was ranked for web traffic a year ago and is now ranked in the same time frame , wordpress com has gone from to again , not definitive , but suggestive of a possible downward trend in blog traffic investors in google stock might want to consider if blog traffic is down , what does that portend for google ad revenues ? if blog traffic has siphoned off into facebook traffic , which is what everyone says is happening , then that ca n't be good for google no matter how you look at it another bad sign for google is the loss of mozilla as a partner when firefox switched to yahoo and bing , i did n't notice , at first after firefox updated itself on my machine then when i noticed , i did n't much care turns out bing image search is pretty damn good , and bing itself is n't exacly a huge downgrade from google , at this point true , i eventually switched my browser back to google , but imagine all the grandmas out there who are n't going to bother doing that bottom line , google is in the midst of serious brand erosion and soon revenue erosion the blogging downturn is a key leading indicator social killed blogging , and it 's killing google , too when larry and sir gay wake up and realize the wings are coming off because of their failed social strategy , they will have to buy twitter in an emergency move to convince shareholders that someone is awake at the wheel but knowing google , they 'll screw that up too blogging has morphed it 's not what it started out to be which was some fairy tale about conversations it 's now two things team blogs run by big commercial sites , and scads of individuals running individually owned sites , writing their own articles for their own constituencies there will always be a place for the latter the traffic may be slim , but that 's our own fault it 's us , using twitter and facebook indulging our short attention spans , when we should be spending more time on the long form web
