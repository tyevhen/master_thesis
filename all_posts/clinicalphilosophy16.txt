merleau ponty 's principal treatment of hallucination comes pp of phenomenology of perception so far as i know we yet lack a comprehensive exposition of it cf romdenh romluc benvenuto here at least are the main themes as i understand them a the hallucinator can often tell the difference between his hallucinations and his perceptions merleau ponty gives dozens of examples of this which basically seem to involve a bunch of early twentieth century french and german psychiatrists playing tricks on their psychotic patients with mock ups of their hallucinations , and reporting how taken aback the patients were , and how differently they related to their real and hallucinatory experiences with the same object b hallucinations cannot be understood using either intellectualist or empiricist philosophies intellectualism hallucinations are faulty judgements response no , they 're not the hallucinator may or may not judge that their hallucinations are veridical experiences , but the hallucinations themselves are not judgements c empiricism the mind relates to the body as follows physical stimuli affect the sense organs , give rise to neural excitation , this travels to the cortex , and then at this distal end arise sensory experiences , sense data hallucinations are the inner sensory experiences without their normal causes response no , they 're not as in a above , the hallucinator often readily distinguishes the two d we need to understand to 'live' hallucination without explaining it , where by 'explaining it' he means reducing it to further items e g to judgements or to sensory experiences which simply happen to obtain in the absence of their typical objects e genuine perception has built into its structure a large array of 'promises' here merleau ponty seems to draw on husserl that if i move over there , and my vantage changes , or if i pick this up and turn it over , that i will encounter this or that this interconnected protentive structure of experience constitutes our normal perceptual world real objects also offer us what gibson later calls sensori motor affordances contrast hallucination , where there are not the same expectational pathways leading from the hallucinatory experience to other real or delusional experiences , and not the same affordances for action provided 'i can feel swarming beneath my gaze , the countless mass of more detailed perceptions that i anticipate , and upon which i already have a hold' f so , following minkowski 'hallucinations are played out on a stage different from that of the perceived world' 'the world has lost its expressive force , and the hallucinatory system has usurped it ' they 'lack the fullness , the inner articulation which makes the real thing reside 'in itself' , and act and exist by itself the hallucinatory thing is not , unlike the real thing , packed with small perceptions which sustain it in existence it is an implicit and inarticulate significance ' g 'the illusion of seeing is much less the presentation of an illusory object than the spread and , so to speak , running wild of a visual power which has lost any sensory counterpart there are hallucinations because through the phenomenal body we are in constant relationship with an environment into which that body is projected , and because , when divorced from its actual environment , the body remains able to summon up , by means of its own settings , the pseudo presence of that environment ' h in real experience , the perceptual landscape 'opens on to a geographical world and tends towards absolute plenitude the normal person does not find satisfaction in subjectivity , he runs away from it , he is genuinely concerned with being in the world , and his hold on time is direct and unreflecting , whereas the suffered from hallucinations simply exploits his being in the world in order to carve a private sector for himself out of the common property world , and constantly runs up against the transcendence of time ' i underlying our experience of the world is a 'momentum' or 'faith' or 'primary opinion' this deeper functions gives perception its reality quotient the schizophrenic lacks this so too is this faith insufficiently established in the child who 'attributes his dreams , no less than his perceptions , to the world he believes that the dream is enacted at the foot of his bed' j 'the illusory thing and the true thing do not have the same structure , for the patient to assent to the illusion , he must forget or repress the true world , and cease to refer back to it , and retain at least the ability to revert to the primitive confusion of the true and the false '
