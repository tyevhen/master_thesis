back in november i updated you on my life in general plus then on my diet , cfs and anxiety i will link them all below i have spent the last two months trying to find the courage to update you on my depression i have always been open on here about having depression i just haven t shared much about it that is because i find it the hardest thing to open up about and that is because it is the toughest and loneliest of my issues to deal with i also frankly don t understand my depression i have suffered on and off for over twenty years and , yet it remains a mystery to me and i feel no better qualified to offer help , support or advice to other sufferers than a non sufferer would i will at some point post about my depression story for today i will concentrate on how i have been for the past few months my depression has always been biological or chemical , as opposed to situational in other words , nothing need be wrong in my life for me to suffer , it is simply the result of a chemical imbalance in my brain for the last few months of last year my depression symptoms were present and i believe in this instance this was the result of a few factors the chemical element was in play as i had been on a new type of ant depressant for over a year and it had never suited me also , situationally i had been under an immense amount of stress for two years in addition to that i was also trying to manage and come to terms with my cfs , although it had been two years since my diagnosis i was still only just accepting it i was also struggling with increased anxiety and i could tell i was going to crack completely if i wasn t careful , so i asked the doctor to change my medication i have zero faith in doctors but that could be a post in itself ! he explained i would have to stop the old pills fluoxetine then have a week with no pills before then starting the new ones citalopram i knew citalopram suited me but also knew they always disrupt my sleep for around six weeks initially so , i knew i would be worse before i was better , especially with the week of no pills the stressful situation seemed to be reaching a conclusion so rather than risk making myself worse during it i battled on but the situation dragged on and on in the end i felt no choice but to change the pills almost immediately after stopping the fluoxetine my anxiety felt improved this gave me a high and i decided stupidly to try to cope with no pills at all unlike when i had stopped citalopram i found with fluoxetine i got no nasty withdrawal symptoms and could just stop without weaning myself off them after a few weeks my anxiety remained manageable , but my mood was getting lower , so i started the citalopram as expected my sleep was badly disrupted and this in turn aggravated my cfs and lowered my mood , i find not sleeping so demoralising i coped by once a week taking an over the counter sleeping pill and once a week not taking the citalopram this is all my own trial and error , the doctor shows little if any support , sympathy or advice after weeks i was sleeping again , and the stressful situation had been concluded yet my mood was still very low , so i asked if i could double my dose of citalopram that was around weeks ago my mood has greatly improved however i am still not sleeping unless i miss a citalopram pill or take a sleeping pill i normally take my anti depressant medication first thing in the morning as this seems to disrupt my sleep marginally less the other day i took it at lunch time and only slept for two hours all night i usually need at least nine hours to function and manage my cfs it is frankly a nightmare finding a solution that suits all my conditions ! yet i would always rather have good mood over the rest as i am not currently working i can rest enough to compensate for the lack of sleep and thereby manage my cfs symptoms to a point however , i achieve little and that is becoming increasingly frustrating i just keep hoping i get used to the pills and my sleep evens out soon it usually does around this time but that is with the lower dose anyway , not my most upbeat or entertaining post but i truly hope this is relatable and helpful to fellow sufferers and maybe informative to those who either don t suffer or maybe considering a medication change themselves feel free to get in touch through my social media if i can help further thank you for reading kelly x previous update posts catching up with kelly cfs update anxiety update diet update
