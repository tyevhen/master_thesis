as it gets steadily colder and more winter like well , not steadily , but generally colder , the cats start sleeping even more , and being adorably cuddly minni orange brown tabby and henry black tabby and white truly are marvelous critters i 've been spending a lot of time on the computer lately probably too much but part of what i 've been doing is researching i want to know what i want to do ! the thing that appeals to me most is an herbalist , or natural healer of some sort i do n't want to be a naturopath , because all that really is , is a doctor without prescription meds , and that 's not what i want i envision a much more earthy approach , if that makes sense i want to apprentice , not go to university for four years the thought of spending years in a classroom makes me shudder i 've also been looking into midwifery , but again , that needs four years of university what ever happened to apprenticeships ? ! ? i'm feeling slightly discouraged i think i might know what i want to do with my life , or at least i know that i want to try and do certain things with my life , i just do n't know how to go about doing them arrgh ! peace takes deep breath , idzie you might also like earth day an interesting excert in honour of international women 's day pride linkwithin
