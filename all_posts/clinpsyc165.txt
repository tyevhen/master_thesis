wow i 've recently seen a study on aripiprazole abilify that boggled my mind it was in the category of godawful i 'll be writing more about it , likely within the next few days stay tuned it goes to show that bristol myers squibb will stop at nothing to market their product , but i suppose their recent large settlement for naughty marketing of abilify already indicated they had no qualms in how they pimped their product the atypical antipsychotics keep taking a beating on this site , lots of hype for these medications treating , um , everything , yet little supporting data
