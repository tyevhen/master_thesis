blogging was the last thing on my mind this past week my wife s father unexpectedly passed away on thursday with his loss i am once again forced to consider the fragile nature of life you just never know what will happen next and , you can never count on anything it also reminds me to live for today stop harboring resentment choose my attitude rather than let it control me release any anger that i am holding on to count my blessing every day stop clinging to unrealistic expectations accept who i am with my current capabilities and , most importantly , i need to always be there for my loved ones some might consider this article a little negative , but it is not meant to be in fact , it is uplifting for me the loss of a family member and friend is a wakeup call to live more in the moment
