i ve thought a lot about lenny over the last few years since his death i ve thought about writing his story on this blog for a long time i feel that i need write about him , since otherwise , lenny and people like him tend to get forgotten , as if they had never existed but lenny did exist , and so this is his life story this is too long for a single post , so part will follow in a few days i can t really say much about his early life , as he always refused point blank to discuss anything about his childhood , and would become agitated and distressed if he was pushed about this all i know is that his parents separated when he was after his parents divorce , he lived with his mother lenny first became a patient of psychiatric services at the age of , when he was assessed by the child and adolescent mental health service camhs was there a connection between his parents divorce and the beginning of his mental health problems ? if so , it was not identified they diagnosed him with depression , noting that there appeared to be an unhealthy relationship between him and his mother , but at the time no further treatment was offered when lenny was he was admitted to psychiatric hospital , again with a diagnosis of depression , and was followed up this time after discharge when he reached the age of , he was transferred to adult mental health services that was when i first met him by now , he was living with his father , who had remarried , after his mother went off to find herself in some sort of therapeutic community the main reason i was asked to see him was because things were becoming increasingly difficult at home , as he did not get on with his step mother , and this was affecting his mood i arranged for him to move into a hostel in charwood lenny lacked skills in making friends , and remained quite isolated within the hostel he found it difficult to fill his days , but was reluctant to engage in activities that might improve his self confidence he refused to have any therapy , and used to blow his benefit money on alcohol each week , and spend the next day or two drunk during these times , he often also took fairly minor overdoses , which he would then tell everyone about , or would try and provoke other hostel residents at that time i was on the management committee of the hostel , and the committee members used to have regular fortnightly dinners with the residents i came to know lenny quite well , although he always remained suspicious of everyone , and never allowed anyone to get close to him in any way over the years i knew lenny , i had to assess him under the mha on a total of occasions initially , these were following overdoses the first two assessments did not result in an admission there was no real suicidal intent , and hospital admission would not have achieved anything therapeutic this behaviour continued , but was generally tolerated by the hostel staff , the committee and the residents it was simply what lenny did one day , however , when he had been at the hostel for years , and was approaching years of age , he went to a day centre he sporadically attended armed with a large knife and threatened to kill himself in front of the staff and other service users he was arrested by the police and i then conducted my third assessment under the mha this time i somewhat reluctantly concluded that i had no option but to detain him under sec for treatment he remained on the ward for several months , but would not engage in therapeutic activities , and resisted other treatment but he remained a significant risk if he were discharged for several years his main diagnosis had been that of depression , but his consultant at that time concluded that he had a personality disorder , and that the only suitable treatment was enforced psychotherapy in a secure unit i was not sure about this not that i did not think that he probably did have a borderline personality disorder , but my concern was whether it was either ethical or possible to engage someone in psychotherapy against their will nevertheless , funding for this was agreed , a suitable hospital was identified , and lenny was transferred there lenny hated it he hated being forced to conform he hated having to attend therapeutic groups he hated having to attend sessions with clinical psychologists and occupational therapists in fact , he hated everything and everybody although i had had no control over this transfer , he blamed me he appealed against his detention the tribunal was interesting his charwood psychiatrist presented a report and attended the tribunal hearing but he had made some errors in his report he had stated that he could find no evidence of formal psychiatric disorder , but also stated that lenny had a borderline personality disorder both the tribunal and lenny s solicitor picked up on this if lenny did not have a mental disorder of a nature or degree sufficient to warrant his detention for treatment , then the tribunal would have no option but to discharge him so how did this statement accord with his diagnosis ? the psychiatrist tied himself in knots trying to justify the contradictory statements but he was sinking without trace the tribunal were from the beginning sceptical about the idea of enforcing psychotherapy , and the inpatient psychiatrist was unable to state that this treatment was making any difference to lenny s mental state so what justification could there be for continuing to detain him if treatment was not alleviating his problems ? lenny s solicitor was pushing at an open door the tribunal discharged him , leaving just enough time to identify an address to discharge him to lenny stated that his sister , who lived in charwood , would gladly offer him a place to live a week later , he moved in with his sister i visited him at her home he had used his new freedom to begin drinking again his sister did not like this behaviour in front of her children she wasn t prepared to keep him there happened to be a vacancy at the hostel , so he returned there he refused any further contact with the cmht , although i continued to see him from my involvement with the hostel committee something had changed about him although his sporadic alcohol abuse continued as before , he became even more suspicious and reclusive for the next couple of years he remained at the hostel , where he started to make odd allegations about other residents , sometimes usually when drunk alleging that people were contaminating his food or his drink , or were trying to poison him to be continued next time lenny 's incarceration in a secure unit for three years and eventual freedom
