originally published at absentminded author , v in the back of my mind i know i am supposed to be doing something very important it niggles at me like a midge around my nose , but i swat it away my afternoon has been spent preoccupied with the google app for the iphone notifications in sync with the web service , sharing photos finally from my camera roll , huddling with strangers in warm circles , notification badges letting me know when something 's been updated it 's been a geek 's paradise there are a few reefs to navigate on our way to paradise island we ca n't reshare any items , making this social networking app almost useless for social networking we ca n't copy text from other g posts in order to quote or share with others we ca n't tag people with a unless they are in our address book , as opposed to our g circles which would be arguably more useful , thus further severing social connections we ca n't re edit posts people such as myself need a magic eraser to redo most mistakes in life because we make so many of them lastly , the nearby timeline is jumbled up oddly , a post from days ago will be followed by a post from minutes ago , followed by a post from days ago , followed by days , hours , minutes , days , etc if you like to see your local social networking history served to you like scrabble tiles dumped on a board , then google is for you if you were hoping to find out what 's going on around you right this very moment , it is less than helpful the jumble is n't any different than what users of the mobile web interface see , but i had hoped that was due to poor gps support through the browser now i know differently it 's very beta all in all , though , i can see myself using the service more now that i can share photos with it it 's snappier than the web version , and offers more features , but i will likely only use google when i'm at my mac in my studio the lack of resharing means g will only be a platform for self broadcasting for the time being and i already do that with my two blogs , two twitter accounts , facebook , etc wow , that sounds pretty pathetic , does n't it ? at any rate , i ca n't see myself abandoning facebook as others have done , or deleting my blogs and pointing my domains to my g homepage the service is a geek 's paradise only for the moment others will find their way to paradise then there will be billboards , and scooter rentals , and traffic jams if you are on g , drop by http gplus to cootey and toss me in a circle give it a name like obviously distracted from important matters say hi we can be distracted together meanwhile , there 's that midge again d follow me on twitter for my adhd escapades at splinteredmind or my novel writing over at douglascootey and if you 're a glutton for punishment you can friend me on facebook as well
