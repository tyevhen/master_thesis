back in i wrote articles on two important kennedy s disease studies for my newer readers , these two studies are still important reads to help understand kennedy s disease and its effect on anyone with the mutated gene the natural history of kennedy s disease i believe this is one of the most complete studies on what happens when it happens to a patient with kennedy s disease i summarized the report in my original article fortunately , this study is well written meaning i could understand it this is the only study that i am aware of that focuses in on what happens and when does it occur it is based upon data provided for up to twenty years of a patient s life this study is different than most , because of the number of patients so often the patient base is substantially smaller i would recommend reading the article if you want to learn more about the onset and progression of kennedy s disease little time is given to the cause of kennedy s disease or current research if that is your interest below are the links to my articles on this report http kennedysdisease blogspot com natural history of kennedys disease html http kennedysdisease blogspot com being is not excuse html http kennedysdisease blogspot com natural history of kennedys disease html the key findings in this study were the greater the size of the cag repeat expansion cag count , the earlier the onset the study used nine adl s activities of daily living for milestones in this study the rate of disease progression was not dependent upon the number of cag repeats the researchers commented that the most striking observation was that the cag repeat length did not affect the interval periods between the individual adl milestones in other words , the progression of the disease is not influenced by the cag count the most common cause of death was pneumonia due to aspiration and dysphagia even though these two bulbar symptoms were relatively mild when first manifested , they were serious issues in the later phases of the disease creatine kinase ck averaged in these patients with a range from to the normal range for ck is to serum testosterone levels were relatively high even with older patients , although the levels did decrease with age clinical features of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy the other recent study goes in a somewhat different direction , but is also very helpful in understanding the disease i summarized the report in my original article in october of last year , a paper was published on the findings of patients with kennedy 's disease here in the united states it is somewhat different in scope than the natural history of sbma report i discussed in may the information provided in this report was obtained during the last nih clinical trial the title of this report is clinical features of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy in today 's article i will highlight certain findings that i found interesting i would recommend that if you are interested , please follow the link above and read the entire paper below is the link to my article on this report http kennedysdisease blogspot com clinical features of kennedys disease html this report concluded that the longer the cag repeat length number , the earlier the onset it also commented that the longer the cag repeat length , the greater the abnormalities in motor and sensory nerve conduction to of the patients had some sensory problems they reported that there was a significant difference in the mune motor unit number estimation between sbma subjects and the control healthy group this sensory nerve issue nerve conduction has been one that has bothered many of us with kennedy 's disease for some time the tingling or numbness in the feet , hands or other parts of the body has been frustrating , because it had not been reported as a symptom until recently if you haven t visited these articles or read the actual reports , i would recommend that you take the time to do so
