it occurred to me the other day that cmis content management interoperability services , the proposed oasis common protocol for enterprise content management is actually a document management standard , not a content management standard its name should therefore be dmis for proof , one need look no further than the data model document and folder are the principal first class objects in the cmis model thus , content the 'c' in 'cmis' is assumed , by the authors of the standard , to mean document the cmis data model is also rdbms centric and sql friendly as it is in all good dm systems it follows the tried and true relational model of every respected legacy dm system i might add that the authors of the standard have basically declared wcm to be out of scope basically , anything that does n't fit the everything is a document or a folder model is either out of scope or will be extremely difficult to force fit into the cmis mold at least , that 's how it 's starting to look to me i ca n't see wcm or dam fitting easily into the cmis worldview which is a worldview , in terms of content being nothing more than documents and folders what do you do with xmp in a cmis world ? indeed , what do you do with unstructured content , in general ? cmis looks for content that 's structured that 's not today 's world sorry so cmis is , for all practical purposes , a document management standard a way to let dm systems mostly legacy dm systems talk to each other there 's nothing at all wrong with that dm is still a critical piece of the ecm puzzle but it 's important not to mistake cmis for what it is not and can never be a universal content management api
