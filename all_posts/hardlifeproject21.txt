ragnarok , motherfuckers ! thank god the holidays are almost over just need to get through new year 's and then we can put this fucking cocksucker to bed ! sucked ass ! speaking of life sucking ass , aka the human condition , no one speaks more eloquently and poetically about life 's basic fucked upedness than e m cioran since i'm so goddamned pissed that i 'll probably start throwing things and screaming if i have to somehow keep forming coherent sentences , i think i 'll let good ol' cioran speak for me take it away , you cynical romanian fuck , god of my dreams , poet of my soul ! to be is to be cornered it is not worth the bother of killing yourself , since you always kill yourself too late my mission is to suffer for all those who suffer without knowing it i must pay for them , expiate their unconsciousness , their luck to be ignorant of how unhappy they are nothing makes us modest , not even the sight of a corpse suffering makes you live time in detail , moment after moment which is to say that it exists for you over the others , the ones who don t suffer , time flows , so that they don t live in time , in fact they never have when we have glimpsed , by an overwhelming and readily renewable intuition , anyone s own uselessness , it is incomprehensible that everyone has not done the same to do away with oneself seems such a clear and simple action ! why is it so rare , why does everyone avoid it ? because , if reason disavows the appetite for life , the nothing which extends our acts is nonetheless of a power superior to all absolutes it explains the tacit coalition of mortals against death it is not only the symbol of existence , but existence itself it is everything and this nothing , this everything , cannot give life a meaning , but it nonetheless makes life persevere in what it is a state of non suicide a sudden silence in the middle of a conversation suddenly brings us back to essentials it reveals how dearly we must pay for the invention of speech god a disease we imagine we are cured of because no one dies of it nowadays if each of us were to confess his most secret desire , the one that inspires all his plans , all his actions , he would say 'i want to be praised ' if we could see ourselves as others see us , we would vanish on the spot
