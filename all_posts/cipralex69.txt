had a meeting with a property owner , new situation new people , got little bit nourves before , but nothing to compare with what i use to feel before new events like that a month ago , i wonder how i will handle it eventually i decided to not give a f about it , just flow and see what happens , just came back , it all went good , i talked a lot , i think i controled the situation well , did some nlp stuff which worked nicely if you have the time learn it later on went to an art gallery , and to a pub , first few minutes were wierd because i got so used to the anxiety and when it did not appear i was not used to it but it also went ok , in a cool way i could be myself again its a shame i drank some beers in the pubs , could hardly finish the nd glass never happend before i guess its cipralex trying to tell me something stop drinking email this blogthis ! share to twitter share to facebook reactions
