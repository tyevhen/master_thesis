i recognized his lackadaisical stride and hunched shoulders despite my distant position atop the grandstand zoom in with the camera yup , definitely b , the young man i 've mentored since he was sixteen he 's now , and the sight of him in his cap and gown brings a surprising tear to my eye i realize i am beaming the wide , proud smile of a parent , and i chuckle to myself with no kids of my own , this may be my one time moment of beaming pride i follow his progress all the way to his seat thousands of onlookers prohibit him from spotting me in the crowd , and i am sad i think he trusts that i am there , but i know he 'd feel better if he was sure i wonder if his alcoholic mom even made the one mile trip i find out later she did n't bother he says he does n't care , but deep down i know he 's hurt he 's very sweet with me his smile as he approaches is perhaps the most relaxed on him i 've ever seen we hug the first time ever , i believe a stranger kindly snaps a couple of pictures of us he thanks me over and over for being there i tell him i would n't have missed it for the world i feel so honored to be included i tell him i'm proud of him we talk about college and whether he will attend the overnight grad party as usual , i find myself encouraging him to go , to get out of his comfort zone , and check out the party he thanks me again , and then quietly thanks me for the past two and a half years we chuckle as we review all that we 've accomplished together he jokingly says , when i'm famous , you can say you knew me when i flunked my driver 's test we laugh out loud , and i hesitantly take my leave he 's going away to college i pray he will be okay i'm so proud and yet also sad i will miss him when he 's gone , but if he 's willing , i hope never to lose track of him our relationship will change , as he will need less assistance from me perhaps this is just what it feels like to be a parent love him and let him go it 's so cliche , but graduations truly are an ending and a beginning , are n't they ? congratulations , b , and good luck !
