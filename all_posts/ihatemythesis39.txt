by yesterday , all of my problems had built up until i was completely overwhelmed and depressed this was not some sort of ha ha mock depression made for blog audiences this was true physical anguish i could feel the unhappiness weighing down my extremities and curdling my stomach maybe leaving the house would help at starbucks , all i could do to keep myself together was lean my head against the wall and eat a chocolate chunk cookie the cookie helped , but only temporarily by telling myself , you 're going to be miserable either way , so you might as well get some work done , i was able to make a little progress this phrase became my mantra maybe going home would help then i went home for the hiding under the covers form of therapy i guess it worked i fell asleep but then i woke up maybe exercise would help feeling a little better , i opted for an exercise class studies show that a good sweat is about as effective as antidepressants do n't quote me on this but all i could force myself to do was follow along in little half movements , and tears kept welling up in my eyes maybe going home would help so i left halfway through the only other time i 've left exercise early is when i had just been hit by a car and my ribs were hurting the wettest of my tears dribbled below my sunglasses and then evaporated in the wind as i biked home home was no better note painting is yet again by banksy who knew that a london street artist could understand the pain of a thesis writer so eloquently ?
