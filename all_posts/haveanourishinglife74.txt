welcome to my mind it is difficult for me to act all merry and cheery when i don t feel like it yet , at the same time , i hate being the debbie downer even more so , i usually just pretend like i m having fun and most people don t notice the small family parties are usually ok each of them knows my struggles and understands to a certain degree i feel no pressure to be anybody i m not , and i feel no pressure to do something i m not comfortable doing it s the larger extended family things that get me in a tizzy the anxiety i experience beforehand is overwhelming i get caught up in thinking about what i will say , what i will wear , and what i will eat the ceaseless worrying takes over the enjoyable anticipation i am so insecure about not working that when it comes to these kinds of events , i am tempted to make up a flashy career just so i will have something to say when people ask , so , what have you been up to lately ? i love staying home but i feel guilty when i talk about it with other hard working people sometimes , i don t think others understand why i need to stay home are they judging me ? in the end , even if they aren t thinking it , i still feel lazy and bum ish because , deep down inside , i feel like if i try harder i could be more normal in addition to the work thing , i get so worried about my weight in the days and weeks prior to the parties i often focus all my anxious energy on body bashing and negative self talk in the past , this is when my eating disorder would be the worst now , i understand that what i am really worried about is whether or not i will be accepted if i am truly honest with myself , i don t think i am good enough the way i am in my mind , if i was skinny and pretty , it would make up for my lack of social skills or interesting talents when the party turns to feasting , it is really difficult for me to eat in front of people i don t know that well i feel like i am being judged for everything i put in my mouth it s like i can hear what people are thinking , you shouldn t be eating that , it s bad for you or it s fattening or you shouldn t be eating anything you should run around the block to try to lose some weight i hear other people s insecurities or justifications when they say things like , i guess i can eat more dessert since i ran six miles this morning or i better work out tomorrow after all i ate today ! i know where those words are coming from because i ve been there myself once upon a time when all is said and done , things usually turn out ok but needless to say , being at parties with this kind of anxiety is no fun so , this year , to make the holiday parties more enjoyable , i m going to try a different angle who cares what other people think ? if they don t think i m good enough , then that s their problem by the way , they re probably not thinking about me anyway they re probably thinking about how they look to other people if i spend my whole life worrying about what other people will think of me , then i will miss out on the beauty of my own unique individuality be a smiling face even if i don t feel like it , try to smile more than not fake it till you make it not that i am trying to be fake or someone i m not just that if i want to possess a virtue i don t have , then i must imitate that virtue i want to be positive , uplifting , and share the joy of christ there are other times and places to express the sorrow of the soul eat what i want if i am hungry , or even if i just feel like eating , i must remember that i do not have to earn the right to eat food i can enjoy a good christmas meal and seconds and thirds if i want i ll eat slowly and savor all the flavors that only come around once a year i ll be a good example of eating normally and i won t regret it after ! embrace the awkwardness every conversation can t be enlightening and at the epitome of class and grace i am not perfect sometimes i say stupid stuff who cares anyway ? everybody does it from time to time laugh it off and move on stay away from mirrors during the party and beforehand since i am more tempted to beat myself up this time of year , it would be helpful not to put myself in situations where i have the opportunity right now , i m at once a day while i brush my teeth but if that proves too much , then i don t know , i ll have to cover it up with a poster or something i am amazed at how much stronger my self esteem is when i am not fighting with the mirror every day if i go into the holidays with this kind of attitude , i will be more likely to enjoy myself i am also hoping that , by telling myself these things now , i won t have the debilitating pre party anxiety i hope you found these tips useful as well may your christmas be filled with true joy and authentic peace have a nourishing holiday !
