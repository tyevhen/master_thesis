a lot of things going on in my life right now , and there are a few things that i m still waiting for an affirmative on if those things come about , there s a worry going in the back of my mind that i will snap not enough to hurt myself , but since i don t know what will happen , i want to have information available to me please don t give me lectures because i m only doing the best i know how to do as a young adult trying to figure out my place in the world i have already sought out supervision and minor help from an older friend that i would trust with my life i just want to have more available in case something goes wrong answer there are already a few things in use that give at least a little relief , such as omega fish oil or st john s wort and valerian tincture liquid i find is very good for anxiety others will probably give you some other alternatives all of these you can buy over the counter there will be quite a few free online or phone services available to you that are specific to young people sufferring from depression a google search should give you the info one of the keys to getting through this sort of crisis is taking individual things that are part of the build up and trying to minimise their impact on you , or remove the source of the worry stress this helps to reduce the overall load a technique that can help is writing everything down either a list of the things worrying you or keeping a daily journal it is amazing how much relief you can get just by getting it out of your head into the world it may also help you see things more clearly you can also try figuring out the worst case scenario for each worry and imagine how you might cope with that , and again writing it all down one of the problems with worrying over things in your head is that they can grow into monsters and facing the worst case scenario often shrinks that monster down to real life size most of us are actually stronger than we perceive ourselves to be , but to realise that we need to look at the problem and it s possible consequences head on yoga and meditation , or even just lying down to do some deep breathing can be very beneficial with the breathing , putting your concentration on your body and focusing on slowly breathing in and out can give you some instant relief and also help with perspective if you find yourself being a bit too hard on yourself , even if just because you worry that you cannot cope , remember that pretty much everybody struggles from time to time some people all of the time , even if you can t see it most people are not confident , most people have times of feeling like a scared little child , most people think they re not good enough or strong enough they just cover it up , or pretend they re not hurting , or smother the feelings with drugs or other addictions so , in admitting that you re feeling this way and taking steps to help yourself , you re actually ahead of most of the pack i wish you a safe and happy journey question buprenorphine treatment refractory depression ? does anyone know anything about buprenorphine use for treatment resistant depression ? i am years old , i have been on many different antidepressant medications over the course of my life with little to no success i have major depressive disorder and feel like my life is slipping away from me i can t hold a job , i have little to no ambition , i am constantly achy , tired and cranky i was prescribed vicodin for a few months for ingrown wisdom teeth and it was one of the few times of my life i wasn t depressed , i actually felt okay , i had ambition , i wasn t thinking about death , i felt better since then i have been trying to find out as much as i can about the correlation between antidepressants and opiates , i have read about buprenorphine suboxone being used as a experimental treatment for treatment resistant depression , after reading this i am very interested in trying this for my depression , unfortunately buprenorphine is only approved for treatment of opiate addiction despite it s potential i feel like i am at the end of my rope , i am no longer suicidal because i care to much about my family to hurt them like that , but instead have resigned myself to the idea of waiting for death to come to me i desperately need a change in my life , i can t keep going on like this i am not trying to get high or abuse this medication , i just feel like i have run out of options if anyone has any information about the use of buprenorphine for treatment resistant depression please let me know answer i really can t answer your question , but i too have depression , and i have felt all the things you mentioned depression is a horrible illness , and it does zap you of your life i m on amytriptiline spand respiridone , i m bipolar , so the depression comes and go right now i m feeling pretty good but i have to be careful i don t become manic look your question up online at md com i m sorry i don t have any answers for you sources my own depression question depression ? does anyone know of any radical or experimental treatments for depression any clinical studies going on anywhere i thought i could handle this by myself but apparently i can t i am so messed up its not even funny i tried praying to jesus and everything i really need help i can t go on like this anymore any suggestions would be very appreciated thanks answer dear disturbed not for long , this may not sound radical but , the very first thing you should do is call a friend on your cell phone for your mental heath support system and while you re receiving moral support take a minute brisk walk or use a cross trainer etc to increase your endorphin output into your bloodstream the longer you do any type of aerobic activity , the more endorphins will bath your body from the inside ! just doing these two things will take the edge off your feelings of depression , but won t cure it you need a medical professional to seek a cure either through www clinicaldepressiondirectory com or nimh clinical trials depression clinical trial and brain imaging in adults adolescents with depression treatment study http www nimh nih gov studies mooddis we re all pulling praying for you don t give up ! ! ! i gave you a thumbs up for being so proactive reaching out for help continue your proactive behavior check out web sites below you ll feel better soon sources clinical trial national studies information about current clinical trials http www clinicaltrials com
