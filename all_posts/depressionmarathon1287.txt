yesterday , puck and i ran in one of our favorite mn state parks it is beautiful ! did n't encounter another soul during our seven mile run through the tall trees , under the bright sun , on the often muddy trails the park is a sentimental favorite for too many reasons to get into there are a lot of memories there good memories that made me a bit sad to remember , but in a good , okay way if that makes any sense ! i love running the rolling hills there the deciduous trees are so tall it allows me to let puck run free and still keep him in sight i love watching him bound around he is at his happiest out there the trip to the park was my reward for the difficult trip to my family member 's home by the end of my run , i was tired , and muddy , and filled with fresh air i'm so glad i went it was a good decision , to go , and it reminds me i need to go there more often today , i spoke for a small college class about my journey with depression i enjoy speaking i have a basic routine , but i never do the same presentation twice i felt a little off today , but the feedback was quite good there are so many things to focus on with this illness , it 's hard to narrow it into one cohesive story sometimes i like to hammer on the stigma , the difference between depression and feeling depressed , and the fact that i have a biological , treatable brain disorder today , i also chatted about loss , isolation , relationships , consumers ugh ! , medication , ect , finances , and i'm sure a few other topics i do love the opportunity to educate i also ran miles today ! yippee ! that was cool ran , with hills , yesterday and today , i'm pretty happy with that so a decent day always more to do , but i am trying to stay in the moment and be okay with what i 've already done hope all of you may do the same !
