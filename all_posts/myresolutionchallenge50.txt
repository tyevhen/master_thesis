as we start a new year the smell of possibility and new challenges are in the air it s amazing to think that three years ago , i wrote my first blog post a post that was to be the beginning of a new chapter in my life and one that would be the catalyst for a life changing experience i have learned so much over the past three years , not just about how to blog , but about myself and who i want to be , and it all began with a list of new year resolutions what is a resolution ? the english oxford dictionary describes it as , 'a firm decision and the quality of being determined ' it was on new year 's eve when i set myself a challenge sick of setting resolutions and breaking them before the mince pies ran out , i decided to set a better example and so i wrote a list of twelve resolutions one for each month of the year this list included the usual suspects lose weight , get fit , iron less and laugh more but i also wanted to challenge myself i included things like , 'do something new' , 'give up alcohol' , 'give up facebook that one was tough ! and many more having never blogged before i thought it would be a fun way to keep me motivated it also forced me to be accountable for my actions a bit like having a diet buddy but i knew that i wanted to keep it real and blog the lows as well as the highs throughout the year as i ticked the months off , an amazing thing happened people from all over the world began to comment on my feeds with messages of encouragement readers were being inspired to start their own challenges , and i made some wonderful new friends , all from my kitchen table making that decision to step out of my comfort zone and start a blog , while tackling my resolutions in the public eye , changed my life i had to jump and grow my wings on the way down i realised that blogging was a huge amount of work , but it was also great fun , and as a first class procrastinator i found myself settling into a regular weekly writing routine and suddenly my twelve challenges became fifty two one for every week i succeeded in completing all the resolutions i set myself that year and a few more that i hadn t thought about , and so my blogging path was set here are just a few of the things i found out in that first year regular posts are vital to keeping you visible in the blog o sphere , but also , help you to establish a regular writing schedule planning out your blog content takes away the stress of wondering what to write about i plan out every blog post twelve months in advance now , but allow myself some wiggle room in case i need to share some important news interacting with other bloggers is one of the most important things to do i have made some incredible friends online , and i continue to read and comment on their blog posts blogging is a community activity and being a part of that community is an honour i allocate time in my diary to create my blog content , post my articles and for promoting i take my blogging seriously because i know i get more out of it that way my blog has become an important part of my life , and it continues to evolve thanks to the thousands of people who pay it a visit i have always suffered with low self esteem and self doubt , as do many people , but blogging has helped me to face these fears head on i 've grown stronger and are less critical of myself i used that initial challenge , and my blog content , to write my first book that book is currently sitting in the top of amazon 's best seller list for self help without my blog i may never have had the courage to follow my dream and accomplish so much last year i started a second blog , this one is for my writing , books and reviews it means double the work but also double the fun feel free to pay it a visit at http www shelleywilsonauthor com i am so excited about the new year and look forward to sharing some inspirational posts with you all i have a new feature to introduce , real women , real lives where we meet some incredible ladies who are changing their lives or doing amazing things for charity in the spring , i will be concentrating on personal development and writing about how to empower yourself i love hearing from you , so please keep the comments coming wishing you all a happy , healthy and abundant with love , shelley xxx
