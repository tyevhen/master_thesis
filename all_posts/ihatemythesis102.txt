study tip above all , the internet is the arch enemy of thesisizing if after many joyful hours of learning the concept of infinity through google , you actually want to get some work done , the only answer is to escape ! just make sure not to do it cold turkey or you are in danger of severe withdrawal symptoms however , it 's not that easy to find a place that does n't have wireless my local grocery story just added it , though i cannot see how that is practical i 've debated asking my roommate to block me from the router , but the image of me begging him to reconnect me at a m is too embarrassing the only place i know of that does n't have free wireless is and i hate to promote chains starbucks so as soon as i finish this post , i'm ungluing my self , not to return for several hours , at least thesis progress of pages written that 's only for chapter , the full thesis is much longer
