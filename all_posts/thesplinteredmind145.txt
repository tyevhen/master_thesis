probably a short post today we 'll see how it goes today was my wedding anniversary my wife and i have been married for years now in addition , my oldest daughter was performing at a talent show at the county fair so this would be a bad day to have a ticking episode of course , my body mind had other plans by the late afternoon , i was ticking so badly that i could n't walk i even fell at one point i have never done that before now i ca n't say that anymore i'm not sure what was worse , the ticking , twitching , stuttering , and clenching or the looks in my daughter 's faces as they watched me struggle to do simple things like speak i received a heartfelt hug from each one of them today , but i felt like such a loser i did n't want them to see me that way at one point , my wife took a turn hugging me and i stuttered why does it have to affect my speech ? i'm a proud man and value my ability to express myself when i sound like porky pig on a cold winter 's morning i do n't feel so proud truth is , though , that i would n't have been happy whether i was stuttering or not i simply wanted a return to the days when i seemed to have control over things like fingers and feet frustrated with my condition , later in the day i chided my wife for not scheduling me an appointment with a neurologist and she chided me for not remembering , and it was really a stupid little argument to have on such a day when we both have been so busy the neurologist was busy , too he could n't see me until november good thing it 's not life threatening but it was i had a clench tic today where my body sort of bent into itself as if i were trying to imitate a fruit roll up my neck was compressed , i was near the top of the stairs , and i banged my cane on the wall to get my wife 's attention thank heaven i could do that much i was having a hard time breathing the tics have gotten worse over time , much to my chagrin and denial falling down unable to use a cane pretzel tics hey , i was ready for a night out on the town watch out salt lake ! duck for cover all week has been this bad i 've never seen anything quite like it and though i tried to make jokes and find humor in it , i finally broke down i could n't laugh at it too intense so what do you get out of reading this ? let me tell you coping strategies the first coping strategy was to swallow my pride and schedule an appointment with a specialist i stopped snapping at my family i had n't realized i was cranky , but once it was pointed out to me i had the sensibility to take a few deep breaths and give my family a break then i stopped fighting myself and raising my stress level and simply sat down in front of the boob tube with my ibook and tried to be as productive as i could possibly be i wrote this blog entry i will now got to bed i 've been pushing my time back and , believe it or not , this is progress sleep is important i say this at am as a raving insomniac i 've been raving for a few months now have n't been able to draw much i 've missed church every week all summer it can all be traced back to my terrible sleep i ca n't say that i'm happy now i missed going out to dinner with my wife on this special day i missed my daughter 's performance the ticking eventually stopped , but returned again later but i was less stressed about it not accepting of it no , i do n't accept this at all but i was n't full of self loathing anymore i 'll take my victories where i can get them so if you are feeling overwhelmed by neurological tribulations , or if life is simply getting you down , check yourself do n't take your frustration out on everybody around you try to relax you may not be able to fix the problem , but you can fix your attitude about it
