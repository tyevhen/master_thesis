this is the inaugural post of a project that i 've been thinking of for a while now here 's my story i'm fighting depression right , see ? i'm already rolling my eyes at myself i'm embarrassed and a bit disgusted about all of this the blog , my condition ugh , that i have to write publicly about it , everything but let 's get back to it i'm fighting depression i 've always known that i was n't as happy as others or , more importantly , as i should be then , in a story that i 'll tell later , i got diagnosed with depression brought on by social anxiety foolishly i said thank you very much and never again darkened the otherwise sunny doorway of that particular clinic since then i started a home business and had to go out and find insurance for myself in order to get a package i could afford i had to take one with no mental health benefits besides , i suppose when it comes down to it , this is a preexisting condition so it would n't have been covered predictably , if i have to take the cheaper insurance package then i ca n't afford to go looking for professional help to be paid out of my own pocket i 've been working at home for almost three years at first it was heaven , given the social anxious aspect of my psyche the depression was still there but a wonderfully supportive wife and a fulfilling job kept me above water but now i'm starting to drown circumstances that will be fully explored in later posts are conspiring to to pull me under completely i really need help i 've been self medicating with bourbon and comedy central but these are only temporary fixes and they 're starting to have their own detrimental effects on me so , i ca n't afford the professional help that i know i desperately need what to do ? i'm trying an anonymous blog i 'll blather on here about whatever is bothering me , the memories that haunt me , and how successful my self help remedies are this blog is my therapist its anonymous because i work in a pretty happy industry and i do n't want to advertise this depression also , i'm terribly embarrassed by this and were i reading an in kind blog written by someone else i would lose all respect for them finally , i want to confess without worry and bitch about whomever and whatever i want i feel restricted from that when i do these things under my own name this blog is n't going to be my only therapy i'm also going to try some herbal remedies i 'll be reviewing these in futures posts
