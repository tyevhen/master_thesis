pretend there 's a photo of the u s capitol here blogger is not cooperating let me first send you to pete earley 's blog to read about the murphy bill , hr , which was passed by the house of representatives with a vote of the helping families in mental health crisis act had bipartisian and broad support , but not until it was sanitized of it 's controversial issues patient advocacy groups remained funded , outpatient commitment was de emphasized , and the right of a patient with a psychiatric disorder to refuse release of their health information to family caregivers remained intact at least for now honestly , as a psychiatrist i was perplexed that these things would hold up the bill access to good or any psychiatric care is a huge issue in our country civil rights are important , psychiatry has a history of abuses , and patients should have access to advocacy hipaa rights and outpatient commitment pertain a few patients and while these may be pressing issues in the lives of the parents of the sickest of the sick , they are issues that do n't come up everyday for your average psychiatrist so was i pleased when the act was sanitized of some of the more controversial issues and i 've deemed the newest version of hr the vegetarian version not enough meat for the carnivores and too much for the vegans and p s , none of these issues were going to prevent mass shootings anyway i just hope that if the legislation goes through , it leads to meaningful change in access to good care for the patients so a vote of to it seems we have a pizza bill with bipartisian support and little opposition all but two vegans knocked off the cheese and voted in favor surely , such a bill will pass in the senate , but if you read pete 's blog post , you know that the bill has hit a wall because senator john coryn of texas wants to tack on a gun issue to the legislation pete has gone into the details of the gun legislation coryn wants to add , and i wo n't , because really , does it matter ? it 's a mental health care bill it 's not a gun bill it 's time to separate these issue , and it 's not the time to throw a bunch of controversial pepperoni on legislation that has finally gotten agreement after three years of debate can we go home now ? oh , wait , congress left already
