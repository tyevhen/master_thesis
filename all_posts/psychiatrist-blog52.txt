oh my , time has been getting away from me and it 's been a bit since i 've written a blog post on shrink rap ! first let me steer you over to clinical psychiatry news where clinkshrink has written an article called new mexico high court states that assisted suicide is not a right if you surf over , you 'll also note that clink has a lovely new head shot up next to her article as i 've mentioned before , the boston globe 's famed spotlight team is doing a series on the trouble public mental health system in massachusetts the second installation went up on july th and discusses the roll of the police , and police training , in handling psychiatric emergencies it read just a little like the chapter from our forthcoming book , committed , only i liked our chapter on the police and crisis intervention training much better perhaps i'm biased ? in writing our chapter , i was privileged to have the help of montgomery county pd officer scott davis and he is a treasure also , our chapter had more meat to it , so you can check out the globe 's piece and when committed is available , let me know which you like better otherwise , i have to say that the news is leaving me rather despondent i tend to be an optimist , to have at least a little trust in the system and in the goodness of people , and it 's all being tested million people in this country and we ca n't find two smart , honest , kind , capable and energetic people to run for president the stories of police officers shooting people leave me ill , and the mass murders in orlando which now seems to be old and forgotten news and dallas , are just horrific baltimore has always been a dangerous city , and the freddie gray trials are wearing on us all there are protests , sink holes , random murders of children in the last two days , a former hopkins professor was murdered while walking her dogs the assailant remains at large and a year old young man in the suburbs was shot and killed while walking his girlfriend home between the election and the crime , i may be due for a social media vacation i'm sad ca n't we make america kind again ?
