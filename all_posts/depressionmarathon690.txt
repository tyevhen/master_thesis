after another rough night last night , my social worker and therapist suggested that i go into the hospital today i checked in with my friend , cindy , too , and she agreed it appeared it was unanimous everyone i trusted suggested the same resolution hospitalization i guess it was somewhat of a relief to have the decision taken out of my hands , and so i agreed after a hour wait in the emergency department , my admission was finally cleared i 've been on the inpatient psych unit since shortly before dinner time but before i made my way here , i had to call two different bosses to break the news i feel so guilty about missing work we are so busy , there is no way for the other therapist to cover my patients , which means loss of income for my company not to mention loss of necessary treatments for my patients and never mind the horrid stigma that still exists regarding residing here i hated having to tell my current boss what was going on she was kind and fair and said all the right things but you just never know you know what i mean ? nevertheless , i needed to make those calls i needed to make my way here probably , this is at least one week overdue so here i am , inpatient psych damn it 's been more than years since i 've been here and i was fairly proud of that fact , that stability i 've had plenty of dips along the way , but nothing came close to landing me back here until today i'm trying to let it be okay i'm trying to allow myself the room to just be , to be helped and supported and learn maybe it 's working i 've already shed some tears , and as you know from previous posts , that 's not been possible throughout this episode maybe it 's a sign maybe i'm safe enough here to just let go maybe , but who knows ? besides , my tears tonight were more likely the result of missing puck , missing bill and cindy , and just wanting to go home but i'm not going home i'm staying here i want to get well , and i want to get well quick and once i do , it will hopefully be at least another four years before i 'll ever need to come back right now , i could use your prayers pray for healing pray for energy to fight the demons of this terrible illness and pray , please , for my willingness to continue on regardless of my current willfulness to stop i am safe , and perhaps safety is what i need to get over the hump thank you for joining me on this long journey i 'll keep you up to date as best i can
