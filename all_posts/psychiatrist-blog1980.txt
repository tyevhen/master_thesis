is it okay to say that mostly i try not to think about the terribly sad things ? i had a group of friends in high school , some closer than others i had not spoken to carlos in many years he was very smart , had a warm heart , and he and steven nursed me through calculus and chemistry i always suspected that he had a crush on our friend igor her real name is diane , but somehow the nickname stuck mostly , i remember that he was n't a stylish dresser , that he carried a brief case to class ! when he went off to college at rensselaer , i teased him rpi where the men are many , the women are few , and the sheep are nervous i remember talking to him on the phone once a few years later he had a girl friend , a woman he later married i heard they had two little boys , but knew little else about how his life had gone igor and i had been exchanging phone messages for some time nothing urgent , just to say hi after september th , there were a flurry of messages on our high school list serve where was sam ? sam chimed in , he was fine , he 'd stayed home from work that day where was carlos ? someone else chimed in that they thought carlos worked for port authority on the new jersey side , he was presumably fine i walked in the door a bit late that evening and my husband told me to call igor right away my heart sank , i dialed and simply said , carlos carlos worked in the world trade center , he died in the disaster it was a horrible , anxious time , all the more so after i had a face and a family to place on the tragedy please no sympathy comments for me carlos was remote from my day to day life , and so many people lost loved ones who were integral to their lives i just wanted to say that for so long after , i thought about him everyday , and i'm thinking about carlos again today
