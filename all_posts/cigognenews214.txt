i have said it many times most of our lives is a rationale for our biology years ago i thought that meant genetic tendencies now i know better most of our lives is a giant rationale for our epigenetics and that is set early on why not genetics ? because early experience messes with the gene and alters its genetic destination and in my experience , which is now years of therapy , it is epigenetics that really counts , building on the crucible of the genes the genes do respond but they are usurped by experience and their evolution is diverted it is the detour that remains and controls it looks like genetics and in some sense it is on the other hand , it is not and what kills so many of us is epigenetics you fate is sealed in the womb and at birth that seems exaggerated , hyperbole , but i think it is true , which is why we have to reorient everyone to much better gestation and birth practices for example , there is more and more evidence that some cancers and alzheimers derive from womb life and infancy and if those early experiences are so strong , they most certainly drive behavior hence , neurosis so what are these experiences ? i have written long and hard about them , but let s take one two being stuck in the womb first , a mother drinks and takes drugs and or is excessively hyper the fetus cannot escape this he is stuck , undefended and unable to run away and escape you may think this is rare but a speedy carrying mother is not rare there are studies that show that speedy mom translates to speedy child just as a depressed mom leads to a downer child these experiences eventually take precedence over pure genetics and determine our lives now , we compound this with a birth where the baby is drugged or blocked cannot get out and into life on this planet he is stuck and blocked again compounded so what does he do later on in stalled traffic or long lines for a theater he has to move , to steal a place or find a way around he is driven by experience , very early experience that is ineluctable and later , he gets married and his wife won t do he wants immediately he goes into a rage he cannot through to her she is blocking his way you get it , epigenetics these are not genetic tendencies but they do play on the genes already in place another example a mother takes tranquilizers because her doctor says it cannot hurt her baby so he learns a depressive suppressive lifestyle and when he tries to get born the mother is heavily anesthetized because she wants no pain at all but , alas , the baby is also anesthetized his being constantly drugged during gestation with the mother s tranquilizers already sets up a biologic tendency then he cannot help himself to get born because he is so drugged the whole biologic balance shifts so that he is moved to dominance of the parasympathetic nervous system he is a drag in every way he is not a self starter because he could not be he gives up easily because he had to in order to save his life too much exertion when there was so little available oxygen made things dangerous his blood circulation was compromised the blood vessels severely contracted to conserve oxygen and now we have the beginning of a life long migraine or high blood pressure , as everything had to be internalize and repressed and so he doesn t like exercise , doesn t like to go and do has little energy so that every little task is overwhelming now this does like genetics but only if we discount experience and if you leave out epigenetics you have no other choice but to choose genetics guess what happens in psychotherapy yep , no focus on epigenetics because no awareness of the role of very early life experience so what happened when you were six ? is about as far as they go , and they leave out , what ? epigenetics
