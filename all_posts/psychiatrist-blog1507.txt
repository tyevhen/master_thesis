since there 's been so much interest in hbo 's new series in treatment , i thought i 'd put up a post about the psychiatry related dramas i 'd like to see some network do someday let 's face it , most television networks only think of psychiatry in terms of a private therapist 's office there 's more to it than that , and i think the public has a right to know mobile treatment a psychiatrist , nurse , social worker and psychologist team up to provide on site mental health care to the chronically mentally ill , on the streets and in the community they respond to police emergencies involving the mentally ill and showcase the problems in our current care delivery system the show addesses ethical dilemmas , legal and financial barriers to care and how people living on the margins work around them is there a shrink in the house ? a spin off from the series house , this psychiatrist starts out as a consult liaison doc in the series house i know , dinah hates house , but you have to start somewhere there are clashes and confrontations right off the bat as house 's brash , sarcastic style comes up against the psychiatrist 's more thoughtful , measured approach the show addresses the intersection of psychiatry and medicine as the consult liaison doc teaches house how the brain affects the body , and vice versa emergency ! an er doc and an on call psychiatrist handle the quirky , spooky and overtly odd cases that only seem to come in after am on a friday night the latest hit comedy series which will finally put an end to all the reality show shlock pimp my meds an nimh research pharmacologist presents a weekly review of psychopharmacology in development , with optional references to pharmacogenetics and neuroimaging insurance court judge judy takes on the insurance industry as denied , delayed and neglected psychiatric cases appeal to the insurance commissioner in lieu of payment , insurance companies found liable for care may choose from a variety of publicly humiliating punishments by the way , the picture at the top of the post looks a lot like my actual tv , rabbit ears and all
