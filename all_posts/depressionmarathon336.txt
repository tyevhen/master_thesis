i'm not sure if it 's a weekend hangover no worries , i do n't mean the alcohol induced kind ! , or if it 's medication side effects , or if it 's secondary to marathon training , but i have been wiped out this week while i 've been getting my training runs accomplished , i 've not had the energy for much else , and in fact have been sleeping a ton day and night i have not been able to keep my eyes open it 's been strange and a little concerning i did see my doctor yesterday , and she confirmed some of the fatigue might be due to medication side effects , but she did n't want to change anything at this time i understand that the decrease in the fat med that is , the medication with the weight gain side effect a few weeks ago has made a big difference i lost more than two pounds in the last ten days that 's exciting , but now it appears we may have to deal with fatigue , too we 'll see how the weekend goes i actually have a race scheduled for this weekend i will be off to run a half marathon early tomorrow morning it 's part of my marathon training schedule i have no idea what to expect , as i have not raced since august , and i 've certainly been through a lot since then ! despite my anxiety about racing , i'm also looking forward to it , as it will give me a lot of information about my current level of fitness i 'll let you know how it goes in addition to my return to racing , i have another big return to report i was given the go ahead yesterday to begin my return to work my doctor and i discussed a gradual return , hopefully a couple of four hour shifts per week i'm looking forward to getting back at it i miss my co workers and my patients and i miss the meaningful activity work provides i'm looking forward to my return
