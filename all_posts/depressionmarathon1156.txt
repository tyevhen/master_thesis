i went to the funeral thank you to those who offered advice you were right after the wake last night , i was n't sure i needed to attend today i dressed appropriately , just in case , and drove to my class early this morning from the moment i entered the class , i knew i would be leaving in two hours to drive back to jeannie 's funeral it was crystal clear a class meant nothing in comparison to saying goodbye to my close friend so , i said goodbye with a few hundred others , balled my eyes out , gave and received a lot of hugs , laughed through tears , ate ham and scalloped potatoes , and then drove the hours back to my class i am so glad i went the service was beautiful the priest captured jeannie perfectly , exhorting us all to follow her example and give , give , give in doing so , we allow jeannie to continue living through each of us he captured her wit , magnetism , self sacrifice , and generosity i am so grateful to have known her one last tidbit i 've told you how amazing this woman was here 's an example when her doctor told her she had inoperable , terminal cancer just two months ago , jeannie got up , said , i love you , and then gave her doctor a hug she was a role model of recovery , acceptance , and living well i ca n't even imagine that response ! jeannie , i will miss you
