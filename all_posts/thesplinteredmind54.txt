monday entry spring has finally arrived like a snail crossing the highway there have been quite a few near misses , a casualty or two , some serious setbacks , and weeks where i never thought it would make the journey across at all fortunately , the snail persevered and i'm typing this on my balcony with comfortable f weather and a cool breeze life is good unfortunately , i have depression and life is not always so good the black mood settles in like a stain and can often require serious scrubbing to remove it depression can be treated without medications , but sometimes it requires a lot of work then there are days like last thursday i woke up and could tell immediately that i was feeling far too down for the morning , so i thought through my set of coping skills and decided to take a walk the sun was up , but not too hot there was a breeze , but not too hard i had things to do , but not at that moment it was a perfect goldilocks opportunity , so i took it i 'll allow the photos i'm posting to tell the rest of the story i am just relieved that i have good weather finally , and very glad that a brisk walk in the morning sun could lift my spirits so effectively i realize that not all of my readers have access to sun dappled fields of desert greens and flora , but there is usually nature to be appreciated even in the most concrete of environments i 'll make it a goal next time to seek out urban beauty i find the presence of green amidst the concrete usually very affirming nature struggles to fight the encroachment of development the way i want to struggle to fight the encroachment of depression and just like spring pushing back winter , i usually succeed in the end d
