in my last post i talked about a family bbq that i was preparing for since that is a potential trigger situation for an anxiety attack it turned out to be very casual and people were eating on and off whenever , so i was very comfortable i sat next to my niece who was all alone so she wouldn t feel left out part of me wonders if i did that so that i wouldn t have to eat around everyone else , and it might have been i was able to eat a lot of good food , and even compliment the chefs while i was eating because i felt that no one was monitoring me or judging what was or wasn t on my plate besides eating , i also opened up to something i normally wouldn t have done and played a little volleyball i didn t do all that bad and i had a lot of fun normally i would have worried too much about embarrassing myself , but i think i am feeling very accepted by my in laws and i am not caring if they see my flaws as much as i used to also , one of my new hobbies is photography , and so i spent a lot of time focusing on others instead of myself and what might be going on in my own head i was able to get some great shots of the kids which makes me happy overall it was such a fun party and i wanted to do another one again , rather than avoid it , which definitely is progress ! anna my year old niece ava my newest niece months old the grill master harrison my little nephew heidi and dakota my sister in law and year old niece
