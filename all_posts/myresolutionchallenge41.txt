project you ! week don t feel so guilty last week we looked at how to stop trying to please everyone else and to take time out for yourself , you can read that post here today , i want to talk about guilt we all carry a certain amount of guilt around with us it s healthy to feel a small portion of responsibility or remorse telling your kids you can t afford an ice cream because you re secretly saving for a spa weekend comes with only a small sliver of shame but what about the guilty pleasures ? no , i m not talking about johnny depp for once ! , i m referring to the duvet day you dream about , or that unscheduled pit stop in life when you binge watch all eight harry potter films we long for space in time to read a trashy celebrity magazine , or re watch a favourite friends episode for the millionth time perhaps our guilty pleasure is a large slice of victoria sponge cake that goes un pointed or syn free what i want you to do is stop for a moment and ask yourself why these things make you feel so guilty what s wrong with relishing those stolen moments ? in the distant past , i put off reading for pleasure because i knew my ex husband believed i should be cleaning , cooking or seeing to our children yes , he was that kind of man ! taking an hour to read a book couldn t be justified , so it was swept aside as a frivolous act today , i not only read voraciously but i am also a member of a well known book review team i no longer see time spent with my nose in a book as frivolous , i see it as essential your mental and physical health centres on your personal needs being met whether that s having a creative outlet or being in a relaxed environment , either way , it s an essential part of your well being allowing yourself small pleasures such as a slice of cake or a chick flick is vital to your state of mind so , bin the guilt , switch off your phone and claim that small pleasure your family , friends and inner self will thank you for it because you ll emerge from your guilt free cocoon renewed and raring to go enjoy x
