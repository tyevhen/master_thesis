guys , i'm joining the hype fenty beauty is here and it did not disappoint ! when i heard rihanna was launching a beauty line , i was one of the few who was n't initially going insane i like rihanna , but i'm not a die hard fan , and as with all celebrity beauty lines i was skeptical but i'm prepared to hold my hands up and admit i completely pre judged and i was so wrong ! whilst in harvey nichols , i picked up a few bits from the collection and i wo n't lie , when i saw the counter , i was hyped i left with a foundation , match stix and a killawatt highlighter duo i 've had a good old play and been wearing the products every day for the past week here are my thoughts pro filt'r soft matte longwear foundation anyone who knows me will know i am not a matte foundation gal i am all about that dewy glow and even with a slightly oiler completion i like my skin to look wet ! so when i saw that the only foundation option was matte , i panicked but , i must say , if i was ever going to fall in love with a matte foundation , this would be it although it 's matte , it is n't overly thick , or drying , and still leaves my skin with a nice glow the finish is gorgeous i 'd say it 's more of a satin finish than truly matte not powdery or cakey and the coverage is fantastic medium but could definitely be built up to full i 'd say i got about hours of wear before i felt like i had to touch up , but it wore well throughout the day without going patchy or crumbly although this will be a great everyday foundation for some i think this will be saved as a night out foundation for me , purely because of the thicker consistency and matte finish overall , this product gets a massive thumbs up ! match stix matte skin stick designed to contour and highlight the face , these little gems are such a dream on appearance , the sticks look hard and dry , but i was so surprised at how creamy and blendable they were on the skin i 'd go as far as saying this is the best cream contour product i 've used the wide range of shades is also ideal with contour , there is such a fine line between too ashy and too muddy finding the perfect shade is hard , but with different shades , riri makes it easy ! i am so impressed with how intense and long lasting both the contour and highlight sticks are , once set with a powder bronzer , these did n't budge from my face all day i apply the contour shade with the portable highlight brush also from fenty beauty , and blend the highlight shade under my eyes and cheekbones with a beauty blender dream combo ! if your a newbie to contour and highlight , i honestly think these products are a great starting point killawatt freestyle highlighter duo mean money hustla baby highlight of dreeeaams ! this duo is absolutely stunning both of the powders are finely milled , so no chunky glitters or sparkles the duo i picked out has a warmer tone , because personally i do n't like a chalky ashy highlight i prefer something still striking but with a more natural finish hustla baby is the more intense colour of the two , definitely a bold hi look at my cheekbones they're glowing type of look , where as mean money is a lot more subtle , almost like a soft sheen on the skin if i'm being honest , i reach for hustla baby much more than mean money , but i love that the duo caters for both those who love a bold highlight and those who prefer a more natural finish for everyday like the match stix , the formula of the highlighter duo is extremely long wearing after a full day of wandering edinburgh and a minute intense workout , this stuff was still on my cheekbones sorcery ! i definitely want to try out more colours from the range okay , those are my thoughts have any of you tried fenty beauty ? what do you think ? are there any products i have n't mentioned that you think are real stand out products ? let me know until next time , s b x related posts things i 've learned in years suzyblue i want what she's wearing croatian inspiration suzyblue a year in pictures suzyblue fotd mini tutorial kylie jenner suzyblue my evening skincare routine suzyblue
