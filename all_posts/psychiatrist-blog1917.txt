another post inspired by a new york times article , 'yours truly , ' the e variations the article talks about how one signs off on their e mails , what 's warm and fuzzy , what 's a cool blow off so sometime ago , i received an email from a colleague that was signed simply b b ? i knew who it was from , and in fact , the yours truly closer was very friendly , but i was left to wonder , why b ? b is an important and busy man and maybe he signed b because he was too busy to type out his whole name b , i will tell you , is short for for bob , and just how busy could he be ? does it really take less time to type b then bob ? around that time , another friend wrote some newsy e mails addressed to d and signed off by c another soul too busy to type out his own name ? ? ? i was a bit put off i always have time to spell out my own name and i began to feel that to do so sends out the message that i'm not that important , i have all the time in the world , everyone else is working harder than i am finally , i got an e mail from t now t is a long time good friend , she was a college housemate and a bridesmaid at my wedding at last , i had an 'in' into the workings of the mind of someone who signs with a single initial so i asked , and t sent me a long reply , noting that signing with an initial could indicate someone too busy to type their whole name , or it could indicate a friendly informality i know you so well that my whole name is n't necessary this cast an entirely new light on things , and i no longer felt that b and c were flaunting their busy importantness , now they were my good friends ! the e world was suddenly a friendlier place the article in the nytimes , well , it did n't say much new other than it 's uncool to sign off with do n't let the bedbugs bite , but i was pleased to see that someone else in the world obsesses about these things cheers , dinah
