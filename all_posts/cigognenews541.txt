i saw a tv special on group therapy they filmed a weeks s worth of breakthrough therapy and allowed us to see the progress before i say it is all bullshit , i shall refrain from that word and say that it has value , only not the value they see basically it is a one week group therapy where they are instructed to pound the couch , yell at your mother and then cry while those around you become a family , and hug you like brothers and sisters i hope this does not sound snide because i think that anything that helps open up people is good so this is a good third line approach that gets people to consider feeling they can cry and hug each other experience an emotional closeness , perhaps for the first time but don t see this as therapy see it for what it is a first step , a baby step toward feeling in the future i guess their idea is that once there is a breakthrough of feeling crying the patient is one her way to progress i never see any science in all this it is doing what you feel comfortable with it can last a short while and that s that the problem is that the ragefull guy will recidivize , and he will be disappointed cause he thought he cured it if they knew about levels of consciousness they would know that they only touched the surface , and that there are months ahead of feeling above all , the patient should know this so they won t be surprised when their symptoms and old behavior returns i have written time again that to do something like pound pillows at the behest of someone else is useless that is going through the motions of getting better without getting better again where is the science ? it is sorely lacking in almost every approach i have seen i don t mind people declaring themselves therapists but at least have some kind of qualification here the patient is again a dutiful obedient child who takes orders there is no sense of what feelings really are , even though they are supposedly a feeling therapy the therapist says over and over again how proud she is of the addicted , rage case he pleased her , and i suppose that is good ? but all this current therapy approach is a do gooder , liberal one but if you asked them what makes for progress in their therapy , they would be hard pressed to answer you cannot love pain away if the pounding does not come out of a feeling it is just an exercise , no better than appealing to a higher power you know , god loves you and is proud of you i really don t know how any approach can eliminate history and expect progress in their patients unless we know how deep in the neuraxis rage lies we can never integrate it at one point the group was asked to draw their early family home , and then they cried about it fine but what then ? how is that different from explaining to a relative about your childhood home and then shedding tears is crying in the present enough ? it is helpful , nothing to do with cure in all of this there is no sense of evolution how the brain and consciousness unfold it reminds me the courts sending ragefull people to anger management what they do is get the rational mind to suppress feeling isn t there a better way ? let those feelings up to conscious awareness , to be expressed and resolved ? it is not a plug for primal therapy it is a plug for science in therapy if we don t do it this way then we are candidates for heart attacks , strokes , hemorrhoids and pure misery as we can never feel totally comfortable in our skin remember , managing anything including feelings leaves a powerful residue in the system , grinding away below the surface in the breakthrough approach there is a decision by the therapist on what feelings will be addressed today is shame day we can all get to shame what if that is an irrelevant feeling for the patient ? again , no sense of evolution , no sense of letting feelings come up in proper evolutionary order i know they all want to do the best they can but there needs to be some thought out approach which is also lacking in every booga booga new age approach in addiction therapy i am appalled by the total lack of structure and understanding there is as an example of this , there is then a role playing in breakthrough therapy where you become my mother and i become your father and we express feelings does anyone ask themselves , what is the history of role play ? did it ever help anyone ? if so , how ? this is a spin off from fritz perls and gestalt therapy it is a kind of anything goes whenever a doc runs the show , shades of albert ellis there will be problems we are again his children and we obey he is not learning about his patient we are learning the rules of the game the patient does not do what he feels like he does what is required of him in the name of feeling it is just so mechanical do this and then do that ! don t think having a doctor s degree is any better it just gets fancier , with more high falutin language , vis a vis cognitive therapy let me offer a solution a solid , scientifically based therapy about feelings
