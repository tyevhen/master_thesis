if there was an award for sleeping , i'm afraid i 'd be wearing a crown right now i'm glad there is n't an award , because i'm not really crown material baseball hat , maybe , but not a crown i digress i'm tired ! i was planning to write an amazing post this past weekend , but i could n't get off my sofa long enough to do so i promise , though , it would have been amazing ! not only did i fail to write , i failed to clean my house , play with my dog , go to my meeting , or even watch a historical program i 'd been planning to see activities i espoused , in my most recent post , as essential to maintaining my mental health fell by the wayside instead , i slept i'm not sure why i was so somnolent after sleeping in , i napped three times on saturday i alternated between my bedroom and my sofa nothing , and i mean nothing , got done it was as if i had the flu , but i did n't i just could n't stay awake , and even when i was awake , i was sleepy motivation was non existent on sunday , too , as the somnolence continued at some point , and i think this actually happened early saturday , i gave up fighting i slept as long and as often as needed i just let it be my week got off to a better start yesterday i actually felt somewhat rested when i got out of bed work went well i was busy but not overwhelmingly so i felt productive by the time i got home , i did need another nap , but that 's pretty routine for me after napping , i even had enough energy to exercise last night i actually figured out how to ride my stationary , recumbent bike with my boot as i sat down to ride , my mom , who was visiting , exclaimed , i thought you were n't supposed to do any activity with that leg is n't that going to be bad for your achilles ? i replied , it will be bad for me if i do n't exercise she understood exactly what i meant and let me ride i'm tired again today i 've been sleeping a bunch maybe work followed by an hour of riding last night was too much i 'd hate to think so , but who knows ? for whatever reason , i 've been tired as long as the fatigue abates soon , i'm not going to let it worry me for now , i'm going to keep letting my body be my guide and my body is saying , sleep !
