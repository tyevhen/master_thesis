it 's baaaaack ! a reader informed me that the astrazeneca supported sponsored editorial which appeared earlier in the journal of clinical psychiatry has now reared its ugly head in the january issue of current psychiatry as i 've pointed out earlier , a sponsored editorial should never be allowed in a journal if a journal is supposedly independent of its advertisers , how can an editorial which reflects the opinion of the journal 's editorial board be sponsored ? this same seroquel advertorial has also appeared in the journal of clinical psychiatry and , i suspect , in other psychiatry journals
