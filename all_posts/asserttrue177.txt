in january , my twitter follower count passed the , milestone every time i pass a milestone , i like to reflect on it , to see what if anything i 've learned every day i get about new followers and about unfollows i decided to list some of the things i 've learned on the path to k followers here below is what i came up with take from this list what you will this is what i 've learned mostly add value be original be honest be unexpected be spontaneous automate nothing be who you want to see in your own timeline if a story is already going viral , do n't be the umpteenth person to retweet it break the preceding rule if the item is stupendously hilarious in general share high value , unexpected stuff that has n't made the rounds if irony is core to your personality , use it it will resonate what 's your personal code of ethics ? how is that reflected , consistently , in your tweets ? you 'll make mistakes own up to them if you have second thoughts about a tweet , delete it as soon as possible thank people it costs you nothing and builds good will you wo n't be able to please everyone do n't make doing so a priority it s okay to take a break from twitter your followers wo n't mind and they 'll value your tweets even more when you come back analytics prove this is so be positive negativity is a turn off and encourages trolls trollers gonna troll do n't engage with them tweets are headlines , and headlines , like any other form of high impact writing , need to be crafted write , rewrite , polish , test repeat only a fraction of followers will become hard core fans supporters find out who those folks are and interact with them only to of your followers are online at any given time a really popular tweet deserves to be repeated a day or two later , but word it differently you may be surprised to find that the second or third ! or fourth ! version gets more impressions than the original people wo n't kill you if you tweet the same thing twice in hours just do n't do it times in hours try to determine if your bio is appealing to people tweak it perfect it use an interesting background photo put links in your profile so people know where else to find you follow high quality accounts create lists to manage high quality accounts some lists can be private , some public thank people in public for bestowing the ff hashtag on you bestow the ff hashtag on others add images to tweets text gets boring if you never follow any celebrities , none will follow you well chosen quotations can be immensely popular favorites have no cash value retweets are golden ignore dms and send none some hashtags have value most do not when you mention a company walmart or a person morgfair , use the twitter handle with a person , consider using the person 's full name morgan fairchild and the handle morgfair , both , if the name is n't already clear from the handle you 'll get more followbacks and retweets from people who are avid twitter addicts than from people who have n't tweeted in a month follow twitterholics never buy followers that would be , you know , kind of dumb do n't follow someone who has ten followers follow twitterholics but do n't favor someone who has , followers over somebody who has the person with k followers may have an audience of sock puppets twitter ceo dick costolo 's follower list is mostly full of dead accounts if a tweet strikes a chord with people , blog about it then tweet the blog reward retweeters by periodically mentioning some of them at the end of your blog your timeline never dies some new followers not many , but some will read screen after screen of your old tweets when your audience is global , there is no best time of day do n't tweet random , low value fluff unless that reflects who you are no one cares what you think about politics if somebody else could have said it , let somebody else say it it 's okay to unfollow people who are n't tweeting , are n't retweeting , are n't providing value in their timelines it 's okay to block haters it 's okay to follow people whose politics do n't match yours you never know somebody might learn something from somebody eliminate needless words if something goes without saying , do n't say it provide the link an explicit call to action produces better results than just providing a link everything you say and do in life is part of your personal brand that includes your twitter timeline that 's my list of learnings from twitter what does yours look like ? for more twitter learnings , see this post i did for authors who use twitter i want to thank the following great tweeps for retweeting me yesterday may you all live long and prosper please follow these guys they retweet ! pssst ! have you added your name to our mailing list ? what the heck are you waiting for , a personal invitation from thetweetofgod ? also please visit hackyourdepression com when you have a chance , and share the link with someone !
