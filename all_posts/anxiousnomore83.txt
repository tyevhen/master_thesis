the limbic system is all about forming emotions and memories various structures make up this system and they are located in the center of the brain the names of the parts of the limbic system are thalamus hypothalamus hippocampus amygdala let 's take a closer look at each one thalamus the thalamus receives information outside of your body through your senses and then passes that information onto different parts of the brain , such as your cortex or your amydgala so that they can take action on it hypothalamus the hypothalamus receives information inside of your body to and from your organs it starts your stress response by telling your adrenal glands that you are under stress so your glands can get you the energy you need if your hypothalamus has too many neurons that respond to stress , you may be the type of person that overreacts emotionally and physically to normal , not so big stresses hippocampus the hippocampus records details , but just facts and data no emotion is involved it sends this data to your cortex to be processed amygdala the amygdala registers tone and intensity of emotions and notifies your brain , specifically the hypothalamus , immediately if it should prepare for problems it registers all emotions , but prefers to notice the scary threatening ones it 's like a smoke detector for your body and brain it does n't respond to the yummy lasagna baking in the oven , but if the lasagna starts to burn than it will sound the alarm ! you do n't have to be alert to joys in order to survive , but if you are threatened , you want your amygdala working to keep you alive once your amygdala learns what is dangerous , it tries to protect you from whatever scared you in the future this is how triggers are born and anytime you avoid your fears , it lets your amygdala know that its right and that it is a dangerous thing , which makes the trigger worse interesting stuff , huh ! something i have found that is really helpful for me i have read over the information from my book several times , but i find that it really does n't sink in until i have to explain it in my own words when creating these posts so , find a good friend or even a journal , and try to explain these things to them you really have to understand it in order to repeat it what have you been learning about ? i have loved the comments left on the forum for this challenge parts of this post were paraphrased from the best ever anxiety management techniques by margaret wehrenberg related posts anxiety and our brains part the stress response system anxiety and our brains part the nervous system anxiety and our brains part neurons and neurotransmitters monthly challenge october let 's get educated ! if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email
