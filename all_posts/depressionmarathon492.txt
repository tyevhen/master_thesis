it 's sunday afternoon , and d has just departed for home i'm a little sad and i'm very tired d arrived friday around pm i was anxious prior to his arrival , but once he was in my house , i felt better we ate out both friday and saturday nights , went to a pumpkin patch for some fall activities saturday afternoon , visited with my parents , and visited with my good friends bill and cindy in between , i ran miles he ran saturday morning we drank coffee , read the paper , walked puck , talked a little politics , and just hung out the subject of my depression did n't come up , and that also felt totally okay it was a nice weekend now i'm sitting here watching football and wishing we had more time after all , he was n't even here for hours it was too short , one week would have been better but that 's not realistic at this time we 're both busy with our lives in fact , it may be mid to late november before we even have a chance to see each other again that 's a long time life it is what it is the real news is we had a nice time everything went well we were comfortable with each other december , , was the last time we spent a weekend together , and this felt just like old times i'm happy
