life is busy no , priorities are different than they were months ago so no pretty pictures this time , but i hope i can convey exactly how much contentment there is in my life at the moment again , i just want to capture how good i feel at this exact moment and document how i feel like i 've finally got my groove things i am thankful for this week a home concert as in a concert in someone 's home from the lovely sam buckingham if she 's touring near you soon , which she probably is if you live in oz , check her out , she 's well worth it another gig at my favourite underground bookshop cafe music venue , beyond q by the tiger me another great act i'm so glad that i 've been able to catch so much excellent live music lately canberra and all it 's wintery loveliness the people who inhabit it who love to do weird and wacky things the people who do n't mind having a little bit of stillness which others might interpret as silence at gigs , savouring every last whisper trying out bikram yoga and discovering that while it makes me super tired , i actually quite like it and love how flexible the hot room makes me weeks of practice at regular yoga would n't have gotten me that bendy starting running again because i found out that my ski neck warmer doubles as ear protection so i do n't get those pesky ear headaches from cold air while running being able to walk the mins to work on the coldest day of the year anyone ? and yet somehow not notice that it was freezing until i got to work and had chilblains all over my hands ouch clearly i 've acclimatised basically having the motivation and good health to exercise pretty much every day for the last few weeks having cravings for healthy foods , and having a good attitude about food because of that i have always been one to crave crappy sugary foods , but lately i 've realised just how much they affect my moods and i am have been reducing them and i am so much more stable as a person because of it ! realising how strong i have become as a person in the last year , and the huge leaps and bounds i have made not just in my physical health , but also my mental health finding a masters course in durham as in in the uk that pretty much looks like the answer to all my prayers i 've had so much fun daydreaming about it it 's basically all i can think about at the moment my family i really miss them sometimes like tonight when sam buckingham played joelene which my dad always sings to me but i like that they are just at the other end of the phone if i need them ok maybe one gif i 'd say i'm about this contented at the moment if you do n't get it , go watch black books now you might also like thankful thursday thankful thursday thankful thursday thankful thursday thankful thursday endometriosis edition linkwithin
