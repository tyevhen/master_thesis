lately , i 've become a bit of an ai fan and by that i do n't mean artifical intelligence , but amy iris , whose blog i added to the blogroll today if you spend a lot of time on twitter , and especially if you read write eat dream python , you 'll probably find amy iris 's blog interesting it 's a treasure trove of thoughtful social web musings accompanied by a lot of really great python sample code and real world data from ai 's experiments in twitter hacking amy is extraordinarily generous with ideas , code , and insights , and the blog is refreshingly personal i 've benefitted enormously from it and i do n't even speak a word of python disclosure i do n't know amy iris , and i have no idea what her affiliations or background might be , or whether amy iris might in fact be a pseudonym , or an anagram is my air all i know is what i read in the blogs and tweets , and so far , it 's all good very good
