the sun came out from behind the winter today finally it 's been winter around here for far too many months now ! it 's late april , yet it 's been cold and gray and snowing and it 's been gray and snowing and cold and on and on and on it 's been just a bit demoralizing running outside , not once since november without maximum coverage of all four limbs , has been challenging but here i sit , reclined in my chair , sun shining on my face , fresh air breezing through my open windows , hydrating for my mile run tomorrow morning i'm actually worried about getting out early so i do n't wilt in this new found heat ! i'm even going to get to wear shorts ! i'm actually anxious to do my first miler tomorrow morning the change in the weather will just make it more relaxing and fun since beginning the iron supplementation a few weeks ago , my running has gotten so much easier i 've been able to do speed work , tempo runs , and long runs without muscle cramps or breathlessness feeling like i'm putting in a hard but appropriately tiring effort sure makes running more enjoyable at this point , you might be thinking , this chick is strange ! how can running a mile training run be enjoyable ? well , i have several friends and coworkers who would agree with you running provides me with so many positives , it 's difficult not to enjoy it just breathing fresh air and soaking in some sun for three hours is a huge motivator to keep moving forward with a smile on my face sure i 'll be tired afterward , but the endorphin buzz will keep that from being a lasting memory maybe i am strange , but i'm okay with that
