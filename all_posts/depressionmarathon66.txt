i began a new treatment yesterday at pm , monday through friday , for the next weeks , i will be receiving transcranial magnetic stimulation tms i am hopeful it will bring me some relief for those of you unfamiliar , as i was until yesterday , tms works by placing a magnetic coil against my head the magnetic coil alternates between active electrical pulses for seconds followed by a second pause for a total of minutes the pulses feel like being hit by a tiny hammer , quickly and heavily it 's uncomfortable but tolerable according to a study of patients who received weeks of tms treatments , reported at least a improvement in their depression symptoms fifty six percent is not as high a percentage as i would like , but it 's certainly worth a shot i ca n't continue to live the way i'm currently living this illness , at this rate , will kill me that 's just a fact i'm continuing to put one foot in front of the other after two days of hardly being able to move , i was satisfied to be able to run this afternoon i 've been feeling really agitated , so i ran really hard it felt good , a different kind of pain for minutes the physical pain of a hard run makes so much more sense to me than the mental anguish of depression anguish which wasted no time re enveloping me within minutes of completing my run this afternoon that just baffled and demoralized me this is a baffling illness i'm so tired and demoralized and confused i just want to feel better i need some relief hopefully tms will be the beginning
