last night as paige was on her changing pad after bath and getting her diaper on she grabbed my hand and said hug ! and pulled it to her chest heart this was the first time i 've heard her say hug she proceeded to snuggle it with both her arms tightly and rocked her body a little to the left and then a little to the right a sort of hugging sway she had a big smile and held my hand so close it was so sweet and i almost cried she then did the same to chris' hand paige had never been much of a snuggler always preferring to be on the move or doing something else but not for lack of effort on our part to get snuggles ! she 's been becoming much more affectionate in the past couple of months and i'm loving it ! i was lucky enough for her to do the hand hug with me again this morning after she ate her breakfast in her high chair she suddenly grabbed my hand , said hug ! and did the same thing i about melted into a blob right there that would have been a good time for her to ask me for a car she missed out on that one ! save you might also like treasured moment treasured moment treasured moments linkwithin
