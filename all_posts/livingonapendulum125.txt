i want to take a nice relaxing vacation i want to take trips , visit places , enjoy myself i want to be able to put on a bathing suit , go lie down in some hot sand with lots of sunscreen and fall asleep in the nice cocooning warmth i want to walk in historical places that are not the city where i live i want to see things that were build a very long time ago i want to see the pyramids the ones in egypt where the pharaohs are interred the ones in south america i want to visit crumbling castles , and some that are not so crumbling i want to see the outbacks and kangaroos i want to see the forbidden city and the great wall i want to see the eiffel tower and big ben i want to see the leaning tower and the colosseum i want to see so many things i just may never see i know they say i made this choice i say my choice does not have the same consequence for all i did not choose to be ill , but maybe i choose to be this limited i want so much more from this life that the hand i 've been dealt and that is probably my biggest problem a psychologist told me to stop setting my sights so high , to learn to want less , to be satisfied with less but if you stop dreaming , do you not stagnate and die ? i 've become old , maybe by the time i am truly old , once retired , maybe i will travel , if i can afford it by then if i have not died before retiring they say do not put off to tomorrow what can be done today they say live your life so you have no regrets i have way too many regrets well thanks for reading
