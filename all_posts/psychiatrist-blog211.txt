in case you 're interested , i hate to exercise i mean i really hate it i do it anyway , in what 's hopefully not a misguided belief that this is good for me , but i will be very unhappy if they ever decide that exercise is bad for you , having already devoted so much of my time to something i dislike in any event , i 've asked friends for suggestions for ted talks that i can listen to while i exercise , something to help the time pass as painlessly as possible i was told to watch einstein the parrot , and if you have n't , einstein was very entertaining , and i'm told i was cackling on the elliptical today here is a link for that short and amusing ted talk http www ted com talks einstein the parrot talks and squawks html the other ted talk i listened to today was given back in by surgeon writer dr sherwin nuland when he talked about his own experiences with major depression , psychiatric hospitalization , and electroshock therapy i 've embedded the talk above , and i hope you find it as moving as i did finally , if you 've never heard elyn saks talk about her struggles with schizophrenia , i highly recommend elyn saks a tale of mental illness from the inside and by all means , i 'd love to hear which talks you enjoyed there are many more hours of exercise to come
