to my readers before reading this piece please refer back to my recent article on add we understand how very early experiences even in the womb leave a trace , something engraved in the entire neurophysiologic system an imprint the imprints send information to higher levels of the brain as it evolves the information that sends is loaded with a force , an energy or valence the earlier the imprint the more loaded the information because it is usually a matter of life and death not enough oxygen , for example or a mother taking drugs or drinking alcohol , or just being totally depressed the severity of the experience taxes the strength of the gates that is , in order to relay information often via the thalamusto higher levels there needs to be a smooth flow of information what helps keeps it flowing and not overloading higher levels is a system of gates thus , we produce chemicals such as serotonin and others that impede the flow of information when it is too much early trauma can overtax the gating system producing either faulty gates or what i call leaky gates thereafter those feelings and sensations intrude into our mental apparatus , and cause us to feel miserable or unable to concentrate as lack of love , neglect and abandonment continue it weakens the gates so that we are chronically anxious or upset we no longer produce the chemicals we need to hold back pain and keep the gates functioning properly all this i have made clear what that intrusion also does is make us seek out those chemicals that were weakened or depleted in the service of repression early on we are looking to be and feel normal so we thrive on pills that enhance serotonin prozac , zoloft , etc or other drugs affected early on so of course someone with a parasympathetic imprint takes cocaine or even coca cola and suddenly feels better and energetic the adder often needs a boost for the prefrontal cortex , and so they are prescribed adderral or ritalin which is an upper that makes those neural cells more efficient or when there are leaky gates there is trouble sleeping as the deep imprints surge upward and force the prefrontal area to churn and ruminate and there are many of these non sleepers but if the pain is great but the defenses hold and the gates are not leaky then we can look forward to cancer , or at least a shorter life this is only an assumption but based on decades of clinical work it is when repression is most massive and blankets feelings that our lives become shorter if one can see the pressure in a primal one would know immediately what happens to the cells from early pain it is not simply a theory it is observable every day in our clinic so once we know what happened in our womblife was the mother a smoker , a pill popper or drinker we have a good idea why we need the drugs we do or to put it differently , once we know what we get hooked on we can estimate what happened to us during womb life and at birth it is all no longer a mystery so if you drink coca colas four times a day it may well be because you mother was depressed and down she also depressed you contrarily , if you need to slow down with tranquilizers it may be because your mother was speedy and anxious while carrying we are always looking for the other half of our nervous system gates are good because they keep us sane and functioning , but they are not great when we lose access to ourselves and our feelings they those gates are dangerous it is usually a matter of too tight gates or leaky gates , and we can make our diagnosis and prognosis for therapy from there leaky gates puts us over the primal feeling zone , while dense gates often place us under the feeling zone a truly loved child lives in the primal zone all of the time
