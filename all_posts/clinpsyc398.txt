i d like to thank psychsplash for the friendly review of my site at one point , he wrote cl psych writes with raw yet controlled frustration , that borders nicely on sheer disbelief and intellectual curiousity do not get me wrong , clinical psychology and psychiatry a closer look is not an open diatribe on drug companies or psychological treatments , rather it is a realistic appraisal of the claims made by companies with vested interests in good results thanks mate ! psychsplash is a site that , among other things , reviews psychology related sites for my psychology oriented readers , it s a nice gateway to a variety of interesting sites and blogs
