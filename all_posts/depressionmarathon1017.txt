it 's been nights of c pap for me , and so far i ca n't say i feel more rested maybe the sleep i'm getting is of higher quality , but i think i'm actually waking up more that 's been annoying i'm wearing a nose mask , which is comfortable if i stay on my back , but i sleep on my side the straps which hold the mask in place are uncomfortable when i lie on them , as i do when i lie on my side , and that discomfort awakens me i also wake up every couple of hours or every time i change position because the mask shifts and causes leaking air to blow on my face that 's not a pleasant way to be awakened , and it 's frustrating i'm also disappointed i do n't feel miraculously better at this moment , i'm just annoyed
