hi curtiss hope you keeping well now i see how depression is different from feeling of unreality or anxiety i was having trouble getting mixed up between them i see now how human being needs to assure himself deeply in order to fix feeling of unreality i understand now how having some kind of faith or religion is important to help reaching this assurance or confidence i am still suffer from breaking down nerves which causes the fear but not the fear that i used to have it thanks curtiss r dear r , first , give yourself a lot of credit for communicating with me in english which is not easy for you yes , you are right , everybody , at times , has insubstantial , crazy thoughts of unreality what helps is to label them right away as bizarre , unusual thinking and turn your mind to something you know is real and abiding for instance , last night my husband had gone to bed aboaut and i wanted to see the last of this movie shutter island it was so horrible , about an insane institution , and i did n't realize it was going to end so badly when it finished i looked around the empty house and this terrible feeling of unreality seized my heart maybe i was going crazy , too , i thought the feeling was terrifying i immediately insisted on turning my thoughts to one of my favorite meditations it 's an old hawaiian mediation called ooponopono and concentrated on that i insisted on thinking that no matter what i was thinking , my bizarre thinking could n't be trusted at that moment because i was very tired i also concentrated on the ordinariness of the familiar things around me and i said to myself that i would place my trust in the grace of the creator and it was time to go to bed and rest a b curtiss
