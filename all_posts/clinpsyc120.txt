i 've monitored the issue of psychologist involvement in torture on and off for the last few years honestly , if i was n't spending my spare time writing this blog , i 'd probably be following the issue much more closely the american psychological association , easily the largest organization of psychologists in the nation , has never really forbidden its members from participating in some practices that many would consider to be tantamount to torture sound strange to you ? i 'd like to write in more detail on the topic , but a group of concerned professionals is far ahead of me on the issue , so i 'll refer you to a couple of spots stephen soldz 's blog in particular , this list is instructive a document that examines in depth what appear to be some tricky moves on the part of the apa to give a wink and nod to some of its military members that participation in some forms of , um , enhanced interrogation might be okay i 've only followed the issue sporadically , unfortunately , but the evidence i 've seen lends much credence to the position of those who claim that apa is unwilling to take a strong moral stand on this issue keep this in mind this post is not meant in a disrespectful manner toward psychologists serving in the military providing mental health services to members of the military is laudable engaging in torture , however , is not acceptable professional behavior , regardless of what the apa might think the good majority of psychologists are ethical professionals who would not engage in torture , but when you place a decent human being in a situation where he she is expected to engage in ethically dubious behavior , then all bets are off hat tip mind hacks
