my school days are long behind me , and yet , even as an adult , whenever autumn rolls around , i feel the same type of anticipation i felt when i was a student autumn and new beginnings i can still remember the excitement and anticipation about starting a new school year and everything involved with preparation for the new year getting new outfits for school , buying new pens and pencils , and wondering what my teachers would be like and who would be in my class to this day , even though i have a smart phone where i could schedule my appointments , i still use an academic appointment book that runs from august to september because that 's how i still experience the year to me , september feels like the beginning of the new year not january as a child , i experienced that last day before going back to school with a sense of wistfulness i still feel that way as summer ends and autumn begins up until that last day , summer seemed to go on forever it 's interesting how we experience time as children as opposed to how we experience it as adults now , of course , each summer seems to go by faster and faster i had a cousin who would lay around brooding all day long on the day before school started because she wanted to make that day feel like it lasted a long time autumn new beginnings somehow , for me , autumn still feels like it 's the time for new beginnings after taking it easier during the summer , autumn brings a sense of starting something new , whether it 's new projects , new commitments that we make to ourselves or a new perspective that we hope to develop starting therapy after being away for all or part of the summer , along with all the other changes that people anticipate , many people consider starting therapy in the fall if you 're considering starting therapy , whether it 's for the first time or you 're returning to therapy , i hope you will enjoy reading some of these articles and that they 'll be helpful to you the benefits of attending psychotherapy common myths about psychotherapy going to therapy means you 're weak common myths about therapy therapy takes a long time how to choose a therapist overcoming your fear of attending therapy starting therapy with a sense of curiosity and openness starting psychotherapy it 's not usual to feel anxious and ambivalent psychotherapy and beginner 's mind a strengths based approach to therapy why is it that it 's usually the healthiest person in a family that goes to therapy ? getting the most out of your therapy sessions psychotherapy and compassionate self acceptance about me i'm a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist who works with individual adults and couples to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at or send me an email
