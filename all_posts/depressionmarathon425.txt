after my miler yesterday morning , i was relaxing in the shower when it occurred to me i may have made a terrible mistake d 's birthday is in early may , but for the life of me , i could n't remember the date ! i just knew his birthday was in early may , and i was fairly certain i had forgotten it ! oh my by the time i exited the shower , my heart was heavy i could n't believe i could do something so dumb i knew that if he had forgotten my birthday , i would have been devastated but i do n't know how men tick , exactly , so i quizzed the guy working in my house and i quizzed my male co workers i even quizzed some of my elderly patients they all made me feel a little better the consensus was it would be no big deal to a guy but i still felt bad i mean it 's bad enough i forgot his birthday , but i did n't even know exactly which date it was that i had forgotten ! my co workers and i , and even many of our patients , had a good laugh over the entire situation ! it made for good humor throughout the day in the therapy room nevertheless , after i left work , i called d to apologize he did n't answer , so i left him a message apologizing profusely for missing his birthday i was honest i had no excuses i told him so , and then i went home and googled some manly flowers to be delivered the next day , today i was looking at various flower bouquets when i heard back from d it was late last night , so he sent a text it ended with , birthday is tomorrow in other words , his birthday was today , may th ! i laughed out loud ! after all that worry and fret after admitting to everyone , including d , that i was kind of an insensitive dope , at least on this day and issue , it was all for naught ! i had n't missed his birthday after all ! my boyfriend , d , received a lovely bouquet of manly flowers , wishing him a happy birthday , at his office today he was touched by my thoughtfulness he told me it was a very nice thing to do of course , i'm still a bit of an insensitive boob for forgetting his birth date , but i do n't think it fazed him a bit and the resolution of my dilemma made for another lively , laughter filled day in the therapy department ! sometimes , it 's best just to laugh when i see d this weekend , i have a feeling more laughter will ensue and that will be just fine with me i like to laugh , even if it is at myself
