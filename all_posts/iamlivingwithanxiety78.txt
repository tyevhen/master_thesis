for a long time i thought nobody suffered like i do my distressing symptoms made me feel very alone and isolated although i clearly knew that other people have anxiety problems , i usually mused that no one had them as bad as i did through my recovery training i ve learned that not only is that belief false , but that my symptoms are average dr low wrote at length about nervous people s desire to be exceptional my take on his philosophy is that if we consistently give our feelings and sensations power and duration , they will become stronger , tighten their grip , and essentially control our lives instead , we need to acknowledge that what we experience are average symptoms for nervous people and not blow them out of proportion of course , some will have more intense symptoms than others , but there s no need to consider ourselves different from our peers with mental illness thinking that way can lead to a senseless of hopelessness , and that certainly will not help us improve and there s something comforting in being average i don t feel so different i don t feel so alone reference low aa mental health through will training glencoe , ill willett publishing co
