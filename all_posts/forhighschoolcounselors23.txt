the first time i ever experienced someone who had autism was in the early 's when i was a young teenager my first cousin , a beautiful little boy , began to show the inability to communicate , made peculiar sounds , and had some unusual gestures my family , not aware of his condition , always had advice for my aunt on how she could make him normal however , his condition never changed i ca n't imagine the difficulties my aunt has experienced with my cousin over the years later , my family noticed some similar , but not as pervasive , patterns in my sister she had peculiar mannerisms we now refer to as stimming , repetitive behaviors , and she often blurted out for no apparent reason it was not until much later after she graduated from high school that she was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder so , to say the least , i have had some experience with autism in my family fast forward years later as a school counselor , i experienced life with my first autistic student this student had parents who were professionals mom was an attorney and dad was a psychologist and they let me know very early in his th grade year that their child had special needs , but he will go to college ! ! ! although i was familiar with my autistic family members , i was still very unfamiliar with the autism spectrum at this point in my career , i never had to try to come up with strategies for working with a student with autism and i often felt unprepared in helping him to become college ready for four years , i sat through contentious iep meetings with the parents these meetings often lasted three to four hours , met with special education advocates , and tried to work harmoniously with his often anxious parents on post secondary plans although he graduated and went to a two year school whew ! , i think i could have done a much better job of working with the family to assist the student in his post secondary plans since it 's autism awareness month , i wanted to provide some information for school counselors who may not be confident when working with students who are diagnosed with autism , like me ! what is autism okay , let me preface this by saying i am not an expert and i am sure i have left out some important information so , please be gentle now , let 's define and understand the diagnosis with my emerging knowledge if you have ever been in an iep meeting , you may have heard the word autism used to describe a student 's behavior many educators , who are unaware of the diagnosis , often have preconceived notions which can negatively impact their perceptions about the student as a school counselor , it is important that we understand the definition of autism and how it may impact the student 's educational experience from our understanding of autism , we then can educate our colleagues in layman 's terms okay , here is the definition according to autism speaks , autism spectrum disorders asd are characterized by social interaction difficulties , communication challenges and a tendency to engage in repetitive behaviors in fact , one out of every children are diagnosed with asd american counseling association conference paper , also , asd now poses a significant public health risk as males are three to four times more likely to develop asd than females cdc , with increasing numbers of students being diagnosed with asd , school counselors must have an understanding of the disorder and develop best practices for helping students in their educational plans want to know more about autism ?
