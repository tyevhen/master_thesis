oh , a while ago i wrote up a review of a book by gina kolata , a new york times science writer i never did anything with it , so why not , i 'll post it here rethinking thin in the mid s , i worked as a research assistant at the university of pennsylvania s obesity research group it s been a long time since i ve had any interest in the details of obesity research , but it got my attention when i saw that gina kolata , a new york times science writer , wrote rethinking thin this is a book which pulls together decades of human and animal research on the causes , treatments , and repercussions of being overweight in the book , she followed four patients enrolled in a two year research study at penn s obesity research group , now called the center for weight and eating disorders the group s name has changed , some of the researchers however , have not , and it s always fun to read a book when i can put faces and stories to the names the book itself is the history of obesity research , coupled with glimpses of our views about weight in the last century or so is it complete ? i really don t know what i do know is that as i read the book , i was inspired to reconsider certain beliefs i d held about weight and weight control i also , however , could think of many examples of people who defied the principals that the author puts forth as new truths kolata begins with the discovery of jean anthelme brillat savarin , a french lawyer , who published the physiology of taste in brillat savarin wrote that the treatment of obesity mandates , a more or less rigid abstinence from everything that is starchy or floury this was a preview of the atkins diet , nearly years ago , and perhaps the start of an endless series of diet fads kolata moves on to discuss the practice of fletcherizing , named for horace fletcher , also known as the great masticator , who advocated that chewing food one hundred times per minute was the key to the perfect weight and all around good health after years of chewing , america was introduced to calorie counting by fisher and fisk in their book how to live around this time , americans became consumed with being thin and young girls started to diet and exercise to lose weight the stories continue the first obesity surgery occurred in when a philadelphia surgeon removed pounds of adipose tissue from a patient s abdomen the s saw skinny flappers and the first bathroom scales and full length mirrors the diet club , tops , was started in there were diet drinks , diet pills , diet contests kolata describes it all almost every woman wants to be thinner , the author tells us miss america has gotten taller and thinner jennifer anniston weighs in at pounds , too light for her height and it s hard to be fat fat people make less money and are treated with shame and disgust , sometimes being subjected to public humiliation their medical problems are all attributed to their weight percent of formerly fat people in one survey chose having a leg amputated hypothetically ! over being obese again kolata continues with a careful look at more recent research in the field both human studies regarding the etiology , transmission , and treatments of obesity , and animal models in search of chromosomes and hormones that contribute to or control both appetite and body weight she reports on twin studies , diet studies , research on those who ve been starved and those made to gain weight the four patients research subjects in the penn study are revisited throughout in short chapters there weight loss progress is noted , their optimism waxes and wanes as the pounds drop and come back they are here , i believe , to make the book more palatable to the lay reader it is otherwise a recital of research studies with a fair number of pages devoted to the search for a fat mouse gene and hormones which might , but so far don t , hold answers to the problem of obesity the penn patients stories are dealt with rather superficially they weren t particularly distinctive or compelling and they blended in the author s desire to show that sustained weight loss is a nearly hopeless goal dr albert j stunkard , the director emeritus of the center , gets his own chapter in rethinking thin he is presented as intelligent , insightful , determined , and inquisitive in his nearly year long quest to understand obesity it s good to know he hasn t changed since my days as his college student kolata wrote this book with what appears to be clear agenda , she has a message she wants to get out there it goes something like this , and i ll list it as bullet points obesity is not caused by underlying psychological problems or a lack of motivation to be thin weight is genetically determined or at least not environmentally determined and this is supported by adoption and twin studies individuals have a narrow weight range , a set point per se , and it is difficult for them to vary from this by either gaining or losing weight it is even more difficult , if not close to impossible , for them to maintain a weight either above or below the set point range there is are organizations , including diet industries , academic centers , and federal agencies which are invested in propagating the belief that it is unhealthy to be overweight and imperative that americans eat less , eat healthful foods , and exercise more kolata quotes eric oliver , a university of chicago political scientist , if you are on the political right , obesity is indicative of moral failure if you are on the left , it means rampaging global capitalism people are fatter no one knows why , and interventions aimed at changing diet and behaviors do not change weight kolata repeatedly mentions a million , intensive year study done with high risk native american children the study , she says , has mostly been ignored studies that broadcast the health risks of being overweight are flawed and it seems that overweight people have decreased mortality according to more recent studies as americans have gotten taller and heavier , they ve also gotten healthier with longer life spans and fewer chronic illnesses the penn study finished after two years on a low note the dieters had long ago stopped losing weight and had regained much of what they d lost they were disenchanted and disappointed though perhaps transformed to a better place of acceptance and the book itself ? it was a quick and entertaining read i did have the sense that the author was on a mission to change our views and preconceptions about weight and all that we believe to be unquestionably true about the evils of obesity at moments , kolata swerves towards sensationalism , and it s clear she d like us to decide that fat is beautiful maybe she s right and maybe we will
