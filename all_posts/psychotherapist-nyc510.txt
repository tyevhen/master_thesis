living in an uncertain world , most of us would love to have access to a crystal ball where we could determine with absolute certainty what was going to happen in our lives , especially when we 're faced with major decisions i'm sure we 'd like some happy surprises from time to time just to keep things interesting unfortunately , much of the time we 're attempting to make decisions based on whatever information we have at the time so , as adults , we need to be able to tolerate a certain amount of uncertainty uncertainty and procrastination one of the problems with feeling the need for absolute certainty before taking action is that it leads to procrastination for many people constantly weighing the pros and cons , seeking more and more information , and ruminating about the possible outcomes can keep you stuck in your tracks so , it 's important to realize that if you 've stuck obsessively weighing every possible outcome to a decision , you could procrastinate indefinitely and not take much needed action overcoming procrastination and the need for absolute certainty the following fictionalized vignette , which is based on many cases with no identifying information revealed , illustrates how the need for absolute certainty can become problematic and what can be done to overcome this problem nina nina was raised by a single mother , who struggled financially to take care of nina and her three other children every financial decision that nina 's mother made was carefully weighed in the context of their limited household budget and the mother 's insecure job as a non unionized factory employee nina 's mother worried a lot about what she would do and how the family would survive if she lost her job even as a young child , nina was very aware that she and her family lived in the shadow of constant uncertainty nina knew from stories her mother told her that the boss at the factory would fire employees at the drop of a hat so , whenever her mother came home looking anxious , which was often , nina held her breath and her first anxious thought was that her mother had lost her job when she realized that her mother was reacting to something else that happened at work and she had not lost her job , nina would let out a sigh of relief and breathe normally again nina did well in school and she managed to get a scholarship to go to college , which was fortunate because her mother did n't have the money to pay for college and nina feared the possibility of being in debt with student loans and not being able to pay them back after college , nina had two excellent job offers , but she had a hard time making a choice she weighed the pros and cons of both job offers she researched each company thoroughly she sought advice from her college advisors and her friends but even with all this information , nina felt paralyzed to make a decision after a few weeks , one of the companies rescinded the offer and gave the job to someone else so , fearing she might lose the other offer , nina quickly accepted the other job by the time nina came to therapy several years later , she had many other similar experiences where she struggled and procrastinated to the point where she felt too paralyzed to move forward even though she earned a very good salary , she was living as if she was still part of a household that was always strapped for cash basically , she was reliving her mother 's experience without realizing it our work together involved using clinical hypnosis and somatic experiencing to help nina overcome her childhood trauma of an impoverished family life we worked on helping nina to feel less emotionally enmeshed with her mother 's experience and to feel like a separate person we also worked to help her update her emotional experience to reflect that she was no longer an anxious child worrying about whether the family would survive of course , nina already knew this on a rational level , but she did n't feel it on an emotional level then , to start , we worked on getting nina to get comfortable making relatively low risk decisions , so she could begin to overcome her habitual pattern of procrastination over time , we progressed to more complex decisions rather than just talking about her problem , each week nina worked on a particular task that we agreed upon in advance and then she came back the following week to talk about her experience the work was n't easy or quick for nina , but she was motivated to overcome her need for absolute certainty because she was tired of living her life filled with anxiety about personal decisions to the point where she felt paralyzed and , gradually , she made progress she developed a greater emotional capacity to tolerate uncertainty , a new sense of self confidence , and an ability to take action clinical hypnosis and somatic experiencing can help you to overcome trauma and the need for absolute certainty that causes procrastination my experience as a psychotherapist , who has worked with many adult clients who are affected by childhood trauma , a fear of change , and habitual procrastination , is that just talking about it in therapy is n't enough people often develop insight and an intellectual understanding of their problems when they just talk about it but , often , this does n't result in change both clinical hypnosis and somatic experiencing , as i use them , allow psychotherapy clients to have a mind body connection experience so the therapeutic work is n't just on an intellectual level clients tend to experience it on an emotional and physical as well as intellectual level it 's a holistic experience that provides an opportunity for an emotional shift to occur so that clients can take action to make changes i 've
