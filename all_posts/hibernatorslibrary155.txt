this is another book review republished from my old blog this is a timely subject for some of the information i'm covering in my abnormal psychology class , and i figured i 'd share it with them lamb hits a mid life crisis when his wife divorces him for infidelity and his father passes away just after his father 's funeral , he meets tommie an year old girl who desperately needs guidance lamb is strangely attracted to the girl he wants to help her seize life , he wants to buy her presents and make her happy then , with tommie 's consent , he abducts her i had a really hard time deciding how to rate lamb the narrative was intriguing almost addictive but the subject matter was very disturbing i had a hard time putting it down because i wanted to know how it would end i felt compelled to keep reading despite a deepening sense of unease from the subject , i should have known it would make me feel that way , but i thought it would be a book with more hope in it i respect the way nadzam kept the details subtle there were no highly disturbing scenes well , there was one scene that was a bit disturbing , but it could have been much , much worse my recommendation read this book if you would enjoy looking at pedophilia from another perspective , but avoid it if this is a sensitive topic for you spoilerish discussion before deciding how to rate the book , i took a look at what other people had said about it there are , predictably , people who loved the book and people who hated it in the interest of proving to myself that i'm not narrow minded , i want to have a spoilerish discussion to address some issues that came up in the positive reviews first of all , one review pointed out that it was unclear who the narrator of this book was to me , it seemed that the book was in the third person subjective , focusing on lamb there were a few scenes where it seemed to be from the pov of tommie , but even that could have been in lamb 's head so that 's how i'm interpreting the book our narrator is telling us what lamb is thinking , and sometimes lamb thinks about what tommie is thinking , and sometimes he thinks about what might be happening back in chicago as tommie 's parents look for her , but we 're always inside lamb 's head that is very important for how i interpreted the book another thing that affects the way i perceive lamb i despised him from the beginning even before he abducted tommie even when his intentions seemed kind i despised him because of how he treated his girlfriend he was manipulative and creepy and a liar all he wanted was sex , and although he claimed to have qualms of conscience about his behavior , that 's all he had small qualms these qualms did n't stop him from manipulating her , did they ? qualms of conscience do n't make someone a good person listening to qualms makes a person good behavior is what i'm interested in , not whether a person feels guilt or not the fact that he feels guilt proves that he 's not a sociopath , but he 's still a jerk just because he rationalizes his behavior , does not mean his rationalizations are justification we need to interpret his rationalizations with skepticism yes , he rationalized his original interest in tommie as helpfulness but let 's think about it the very first time he met tommie , he grabbed her arm and threw her in his truck so hard that her head hit the window she was terrified yes , he rationalized that he was helping her to see what could have happened she should n't have approached him a stranger because he could have been dangerous he rationalized that he taught her a lesson but the fact that he was willing to frighten her like that was the first hint that his behavior towards her was driven by darker urges yes , perhaps this time around his rationalization had some grain of truth in it perhaps she did learn a lesson but was that lesson his to teach ? lamb 's rationalizations continued throughout the entire book i never interpreted them as anything but rationalizations so i was rather surprised when i read in some reviews that they interpreted his intentions as good let 's think about this rationalization abducting her in front of her friends taught her a lesson about approaching strangers and about shallow friends we discussed this above rationalization encouraging her to skip school and lie to her parents in order to hang out with him did n't corrupt her , because she was already doing those things well , if he really cared , he would n't encourage her to skip school and keep secrets that 's sleazy , creepy behavior rationalization abducting her and teaching her to be a woman was helpful , because she needed that experience it would help her break out of that awkward phase in life and burst into the world with new confidence she 'd look back with fondness on him now this is where the rationalization gets sticky i interpreted these flash forwards to be rationalizations taking place in lamb 's head but , if you interpret these flash forwards to be accurate or from the point of view of tommie , i can see where you might as some people apparently do ! think that lamb helped tommie in the interest of not being narrow minded , i tried to look at it from that point of view but , no the story simply makes more sense to me if i interpret these flash forwards as rationalizations in the head of lamb and lamb is rationalizing because he knows he 's hurting her in fact , it 's clear he knows he 's hurting her , because there are other scenes in which he 's crying and telling tommie that if she ever hates him , she should kick his balls in does n't that show us that he knows he 's doing wrong ? some reviews actually suggested that lamb loved tommie , and that his intentions were good but he knew he was hurting her or else he would n't break down into tears and tell her to kick his balls in , and he would n't rationalize he was consciously lying and manipulating her it 's clear that these were conscious acts , because in one scene he pointed out to his girlfriend that he makes people say and do things so , i'm convinced that lamb knew he was hurting her why would he act that way if he loved her ? that 's not love love is selfless that 's a darker sort of obsession that 's acting on urges love can be an obsession , but we should n't assume that obsession is love finally , some people questioned whether lamb had actually had intercourse with tommie there was nothing that directly said he did , but i felt it was implied he definitely kissed her , saw her naked , and slept in the same bed as her furthermore he got kicks out of letting tommie watch him having sex with his girlfriend , which is a form of molestation in itself so , yes , how far he went is still a question , and i'm glad i did n't have to read that one last detail but i made my own conclusion about the issue and it was n't good
