did you know that diet could affect mental health ? okay , that is , perhaps , putting it too strongly diet is correlated with mental health , especially in australia mental health disorders tend to be pretty chronic and can be debilitating and , unlike many chronic diseases of western civilization , they tend to strike young autism in babyhood , anxiety disorders often before age , mood disorder in the teens , schizophrenia in the late teens and early adulthood psychiatric disorders cost us so much in terms of productivity and health y'all already know what i think donnie darko , mad world right click to open in new tab there is every reason to believe a modern , processed , nutrient poor diet could have a lot of influence on mental health of course , no one knows what to tell anyone to eat except for fruits and vegetables and that is what plos tells us today a prospective study of diet quality and mental health in adolescents in this study , several thousand australian adolescents filled out surveys about diet , health , and mental health several years apart here is how diet quality was assessed as such , a point was allotted for each of the following eating breakfast at home on school days eating lunch brought from home consuming two or more fruit serves per day four or more vegetable serves per day fruit and or sandwiches as after school snacks generally avoiding biscuits , potato chips , pies , hot chips , fried foods , chocolate , sweets , ice creams as after school snacks and , finally , both consuming healthy after school snacks and avoiding unhealthy after school snacks chocolate ? ? ? ? it is not terribly surprising that an unhealthy diet score in the first survey correlated with a poorer rating of mental health in the second survey several years later covariates were assessed for but can never really be extinguished completely interestingly , mental health at baseline did not predict diet several years later , strengthening the findings of the study but i rather love these researchers , and will quote some of the interpretation in full here the prevalence of emotional and conduct problems in adolescents increased in the period between the mid 's and , while a new meta analysis , reporting on data collected at many time points and , thus , free of confounding by age and or recall bias , has reported large generational increases in self reported psychopathology in american high school and college students between the s and these increases did not appear to be explained by social response biases , economic cycles or changes in student populations , and the authors concluded that changes in unidentified cultural factors have resulted in increased rates of psychopathology among american youth paralleling this possible increase in the rates of psychological illness among young people are data indicating a reduction in the quality of adolescents' diets over recent decades a report based on trends in adolescent food consumption in the us identified a reduction in the consumption of raw fruits , high nutrient vegetables and dairy foods , which are important sources of fibre and essential nutrients , between and , with an associated increase in the consumption of fast food , snacks and sweetened beverages concurrently , population surveys demonstrate a substantial increase in overweight and obesity among children and adolescents over recent decades obesity does not necessarily indicate nutritional repletion , as high energy foods typically have poor nutrient content could it all be connected ? increasing muffin tops and increasing psych hospitalizations in children and increasing psychopathology ? and how expensive is it to society when a lean cuisine is the epitome of healthy eating ? a very very mad world indeed
