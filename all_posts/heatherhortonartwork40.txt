sadness is but a wall between two gardens kahlil gibran every artist has their own manifesto , their own impetus that resides underneath the paint our reasons for painting are as varied as our techniques and the beauty of it is there is no correct answer it is ultimately subjective speaking of manifestos , and on a side note , my friend conrad once suggested i read pulitzer prize winner mary oliver 's book blue pastures within its pages there is an essay called of power and time it resonated with me very strongly as a creative person you should read it periodically i do a self portrait of myself , bereft i call it , unofficially the crying series i never know when another piece will be added , which is part of their appeal i find this painting , self portrait , after , oil on panel , , x , is the third piece in the ongoing series pain and sadness are just as much a part of life as joy and fulfillment , the question is , what do we do with these ebbs of the spirit ? i choose to paint them by doing do it makes them a reality it is cathartic it enables me to work through the sadness , to try to capture a bit of that intensity of emotion i am not wallowing in despair , but instead , literally , making the most out of a bad situation when you look at the painting , remember that it is not important why i was crying , but how it resonates with you i paint these pieces for myself , but with the hope that others can understand and place themselves in a similar situation where they felt the same hand wringing of the soul on a technical note , i had great interest in painting my eyes i wanted to show that delicate translucency that one 's lids have during and after the struggle self portrait , after is available at abbozzo gallery , and is a part of an upcoming exhibition of my work i will have a selection of new paintings which will be displayed in conjunction with paintings inspired by the life and travels of christopher mccandless christopher 's story was the subject of john krakauer 's book into the wild , and the film into the wild directed by sean penn the exhibition will have its opening reception on june rd from pm i will also be at the gallery on saturday , june th from pm for guests who were not able to make the opening reception the night before i hope to see you there ! have a beautiful day and weekend chris 's pack , stampede trail , oil on panel , x an aesthetic voyage painting inspired by the life and travels of christopher mccandless june th , abbozzo gallery , oakville , ontario , canada opening reception june rd , pm june th , artist in attendance from pm if you are interested in any of these paintings you can contact the gallery toll free at or at mail abbozzogallery com diary of a supertramp study , oil on panel , x to the sea , oil on canvas , x chris 's tent , stampede trail , oil on canvas , x rather than love , than money , than fame , give me truth henry david thoreau
