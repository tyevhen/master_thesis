i apologize profusely for my inattention to this blog over the past week i believe this is the longest gap in posts since i began this blog over years ago i pride myself on regularly posting here , so i come back to you ever so apologetically i have n't been participating in life much this week my mood took an extremely precipitous dive last weekend i ran my half marathon on saturday , and i felt like my fairly normal self afterwards as far as i remember , nothing abnormal happened saturday or sunday , but by mid day sunday i was reeling in the abyss the world was dark my thoughts were darker i was overwhelmed and paralyzed just like that my situation has not improved this week things are still very dark my thoughts are frightening , yet i am somehow not frightened and that is a bit scary if that makes any sense it 's been a really , really rough week it 's been so rough , i have n't had the energy to do much of anything , including posting here nor have i been a model patient or role model i 've been isolating i do n't want to see or talk to anyone i 've had fits of anger and frustration i 've thrown meds in the toilet , contemplated my worthiness , and been obstructed by a very noisy brain i have n't always handled things well this week i do feel an obligation to be a positive voice here , which made the thought of blogging when i felt so low a precarious proposition i did n't know what to do i felt like i could n't post what i was feeling , thinking , or doing , as there was n't much positivity in any of it so i did n't post anything at all but tonight i figured i 'd at least let you know what 's been going on , even if it meant skipping most of the gory details the gory details are n't necessary many of you have been there , done that things suck life does n't seem worth living if it means living like this , which is why i'm praying for relief i'm doing what i can , and i'm waiting i'm hoping this will pass soon
