so , i do n't even know if i 've mentioned it previously on this blog , although i 've certainly thought a lot about it , but about a month ago i bought tickets to a show by one of my absolute favorite bands , and that is , of course , rise against well , last night was the concert and it was great i love that band soooo much their message , the fact that they 're all vegetarians , and most importantly of course their music the passion , enthusiasm , and energy i get from it is just amazing i was really excited seeing them live , with my sister and our friends nick and tim , and of course we watched from the floor this is only the second concert i 've been too , and i was on the floor for both i ca n't help but think you 'd miss out by sitting in the stands traffic was awful getting there , so we missed the first opening band , but the second opening act , thursday , was n't bad i did n't really like the singers voice , but the music was cool rise against supports peta i do n't like peta but i figure the band has good intentions by supporting them so during the break before ra came on , nick and i wandered over to their table , signed a petition requesting all meat be labeled with it 's environmental impact , and got these awesome meat 's not green buttons i was so shocked when nick said he wanted to go vegetarian , his parents just wo n't let him ! when i think of what he was like when i first met him , i can see his opinions have changed so much ! we 've certainly dragged him away from the mainstream mwuahaha anyway , when rise against finally came on , the crowd went wild ! and i was thrilled that they opened with one of my favorite songs , drones , and played nearly all of my favorites by them the only complaints i have , and the first one is pretty major , is that the volume ratio between voice and instruments was off i could hardly hear his voice at times ! another thing that was n't so great was getting shoved by a couple dozen people as they pushed through the crowd ca n't you just find a spot and stick with it , dammit ! and getting stuck with an extremely drunk guy beside me , who bashed into me multiple times luckily , nick was kind and took that spot , then the guy went away , most likely to find more beer but back on topic , i'm really glad i went crowd enthusiasm was great at one point tim lead singer had everyone chant rise while pumping their fists in the air i do n't remember if it was nick or emi who called it a communist moment , but both agreed it was really cool p , when the crowd was urged to sing certain bits themselves , everyone sung loud and clear , and for hero of war , a very sad folksy anti war song , the whole crown sung along to the entire song it was beautiful as always seems to happen with things , it was over too soon when we were talking about it afterward , i was saying to emi how the crowd seemed more enthusiastic here then for the linkin park concert we went to last year , and she disagreed we finally realized that the difference was that for linkin park , the crowd liked the music they got exited for certain songs , but were n't great for crowd participation whereas for rise against , the crowd loved them as a band , and loved their very political message we were supposed to get picked up by my mom at , but the concert ended a bit before , so we called to let her know then wandered off to find a warm place that served food sadly , the concert was at a university building , surrounded by other university building , and lots of residential streets beyond that , so finding anywhere to go took lots of walking in what felt like at least c , with lots of ice on the sidewalks , and snow we discovered that subway closes early , much to our unhappiness , and the only open coffee shop we saw was packed we finally bought some food from a grocery store and then headed back to the coffee shop , which had thankfully become less crowded i should mention why my mom had n't arrived at this point , and the reason she had n't was traffic how can there be awful traffic at past at night ? she finally arrived at a bit past , with hot chocolate and chai waiting in the car i love my mom ! , which made our cold selves happy i was saying later on to emi how awful it must be to be homeless spending an hour outside in the winter , finding anyplace warm we can to stay , getting suspicious look when we try and hang out in the warm grocery store can you imagine knowing that no one was coming to get you ? ? o o emi and i both agreed it made us want to donate large amounts of money to homeless shelters i think i 've rambled on enough now since no camera 's were allowed at the concert , i 'll leave you with these photo 's taken off of rise against 's website peace , idzie
