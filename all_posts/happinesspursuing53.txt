it s saturday morning , about a i m the only one up usually my wife is up by now but she has to work a very long day on fridays hours so she deservedly sleeps in on saturdays when she can i m trudging through a book that is at the same time fascinating and frustrating it s one of the two that i mentioned earlier i plan to review for this blog i m always very torn when i don t love a book which i ve been given to review first , the book was free so i feel like i owe someone a positive reveiw second the book was published and i have an idea of the incredible amount of work that went into doing so third , whether i like it or not , the writer has been judged on some level to be a better writer than myself i haven t published a book so i have to wonder if i even had the right to not like it but i m torn about this book for other reasons it s written in first person so to read it is to live in the writer s head i only point this out because with every page i am more and more annoyed with every character in the book , especially the narrator even so , i can t help but be fascinated by the story and continually drawn to turn the page on that level i have to admit that the book is a success i m still not sure how i m going to review it but that s not what i wanted to write about i wanted to write about an english teacher of mine who died during my junior year of high school i ll do that later i ve noticed that my entries here tend to ramble so i m making a conscious effort to shorten them if i m going to do that then i d better stop this entry right now
