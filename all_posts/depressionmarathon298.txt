yesterday dawned drizzly , cold and gray it was a perfect day for a long run rather than worry about overheating , as was the case in my last two marathons , there was actually a risk of hypothermia at grandmas marathon yesterday the fog was so heavy and thick , it was hard to see the mile markers huge , tethered , yellow balloons as we approached each of them and i do n't think the temperature ever rose beyond the mid 's like i said , it was a perfect day for a long run i took advantage of the conditions wearing shorts , two shirts , a hat , and a pair of gloves , i raced my way to a boston qualifying time i definitely run better in cooler weather ! i actually surprised myself yesterday despite the cool conditions , i did n't feel all that great for quite awhile i ran the first three miles with my friend , therese , but then i asked her to go ahead without me i could tell i needed to slow down , or i was going to crash later , and i certainly did n't want that she went ahead , and i slowed my pace just a bit still things were iffy i was n't at all confident it was n't until after a pit stop at mile eight , which cost me seconds , that i began to improve mentally and physically concerned about the lost seconds , which i know is silly , i picked up the pace and surprisingly felt okay i went from running 's per mile to running 's for most of the middle miles rather than thinking too far ahead , i focused on each successive mile i thought only of making it to the next mile marker , literally running one mile at a time , rather than worrying about what was going to happen miles down the road i also smiled a lot the smiling started , innocently , around mile or when i began to gain confidence with each successful mile completed , i got more and more confident that i was going to finish , and perhaps even finish well the smiling seemed to help my running , so then i began smiling on purpose , especially during rough patches it worked each time i felt tired or worn out , i smiled , and each rough patch eventually passed and that led to more smiling ! before i knew it , i was at mile , then and i knew i was going to finish i let it go i could n't wait to cross that line miles and were the two fastest miles i ran in the entire race i slowed again during mile , as my legs tightened up , but i crossed the finish line tall and proud unlike the recent boston and med city marathons , there was no walking yesterday i ran the entire distance , and i was proud of that i also ran a negative split , meaning i ran the second half of the race faster than the first , and i was proud of that for the most part , i did n't even think about my overall time i was at mile before i noted i was likely going to finish well under the boston qualifying standard and i did i qualified by more than minutes qualifying was a bonus , however i'm really happy to have run well and to have felt well while doing it i'm really proud i did n't let myself down i did n't let negativity creep in instead i felt almost giddy at times i had fun even though i initially did n't feel great , i kept going until i felt better the training , which had n't had me feeling very confident lately , did pay off i challenged myself , and i met the challenge it was a good day
