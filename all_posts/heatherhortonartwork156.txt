i am attracted to the seemingly mundane , utilitarian objects we use or see every day when my family was going through some health challenges awhile back i became very familiar with the sight of these poles in the hospital the cold yet comforting glow of the illuminated numbers acted as a gentle reminder that healing was taking place i could not interpret the majority of the information displayed and yet i knew that its purpose was to help , to relieve , to regulate and balance often the only thing on an i v pole is a bag of saline or some other healing liquid other times there is an ivac , as is depicted in the painting i worked for a time in a hospital and there was always a copse of poles at one end of the ward or in the supply room many patients walk around the hospital with their hands upon this thing , this object that might be easily forgotten after the fact but is so very important at the time my mother was an operating room nurse for over years when i went to visit her at the hospital as a wide eyed child the poles were invariably there , being pushed , pulled or merely standing , waiting whatever its use , the pole it is something that i wanted to paint , something that chronicled a period of difficulty in the life of my family it is easily recognizable we have all had experience with these objects , some more than others and for any number of reasons whatever the purpose , i painted it to remind me of that time , the places where my family faced a lot of hardship , and also to serve as a symbol of what issues they have overcome the greater difficulty , the more glory in surmounting it skillful pilots gain their reputation from storms and tempests epicurus
