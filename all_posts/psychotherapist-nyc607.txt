looking back on past romantic relationships , do you see particular patterns that were consistent in these relationships ? it 's easy to blame your former romantic partners for all the problems in those relationships or to blame it on bad luck what 's more challenging is to see your own patterns in those relationships that you 're continuing to perpetuate with each new relationship learning from past romantic relationships looking at your own recurring patterns in past romantic relationships not all relationships end because of recurring interpersonal patterns many relationships end because one of both people change in dissimilar ways and they no longer want the same things people grow apart sometimes , one or both people forget that relationships need to be nurtured and that neglect leads to the end of a relationship but when you can look back with a degree of objectivity , you might find that you , being the common denominator in all of your relationships , continue to engage in certain patterns that contribute to the demise of these relationships and , if this is the case , it 's worthwhile for your own personal development , as well as the potential for having a successful relationship in the future , if that 's what you want , to look at these patterns it 's impossible to include all the possible recurring patterns the following fictionalized scenario demonstrates how learning from past romantic relationships can be beneficial to you as always , this scenario is a composite of many different cases so that confidentiality is preserved ann ann , who was in her late s , came to therapy after a recent breakup the man she had been seeing for two years had just ended their relationship , and ann was heart broken this was the latest in a series of breakups over the years in which the man she was dating ended the relationship learning from past romantic relationships ann wanted , more than anything , to get married and have a family she was very aware of her biological clock and that it might be difficult for her to get pregnant , so she was hoping her most recent relationship would lead to marriage and children but , instead , just like her prior relationships , it ended in heart break and disappointment when she started therapy , she blamed the breakups on a combination of bad luck and poor judgment in choosing the wrong men these relationships all started well with each one , she saw the potential for long term happiness but , gradually , she and her romantic partners began arguing about how much time to spend together and their divergent expectations about the relationship what made matters worse is that , whenever ann entered into a new relationship , she stopping talk to and seeing her friends , so that when she needed emotional support , they expressed resentment towards her that they had n't heard from her in a while and were annoyed that she called them only when she was having problems ann had a hard time seeing this because she was so immersed in whatever relationship she was in she thought her friends should be there for her , even if she 'd made no effort to be in touch with them for months related to her problem of disengaging from her friends , she expected that her current romantic partner would supply all her emotional , intellectual and physical needs even when she had a lot in common with her current boyfriend , inevitably , there were some interests that she had that he did n't when her current boyfriend did n't want to take up one of her particular interests , she became annoyed and disappointed this led to arguments and her expectations and the arguments led to her boyfriends telling her that they felt suffocated by her and that it was n't reasonable for her to expect to have all of her needs met in the relationship but this was contrary to ann 's basic assumptions and expectations in a relationship it took a while for ann to be willing to explore her basic assumptions and expectations of relationships because she held them very tightly she wanted her boyfriend to be her everything and could n't understand why anyone who was her boyfriend would n't want this too she also could n't understand why her boyfriends wanted to see their friends and go to sports events or other activities with them when she was very willing to take up these interests this also created a lot of friction in her relationships as we explored her history of relationships , there was no evidence to suggest that she had a string of bad luck or that these men had particular problems that contributed to the breakups the problem in all of these relationships was , primarily , that ann wanted to create an exclusive dependency between her and her boyfriend , and she refused to see that this created recurring problems in her relationships even if she found a boyfriend who wanted the same kind of intense dependency that excluded other people , having such an insular relationship would have been emotionally unhealthy often , sooner or later , people get bored and the individuals and the relationship becomes stagnant one person ca n't meet all your needs it took a while for ann to be willing to look at herself rather than externalizing her problems in relationships family history played a big part in her views ann needed to learn how to be in a relationship and how to maintain and nurture her friendships learning from past romantic relationships at that point , she was able to change her usual dynamics and she was a lot happier in a new long term relationship and in her friendships getting help in therapy when you 're open to looking at your own recurring patterns in relationships , you have an opportunity to make changes as i mentioned previously , this is just one
