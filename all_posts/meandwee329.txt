i woke up today in an extra tired way i looked at the clock and it said i heard paige making her calls for me loud mmmmmmmmmmmmm sounds and off i went i did n't sleep well and have n't much of the week lots of insomnia and trouble with my chatterbox brain anyway , i grabbed little p and gave her the milk and off we went it turns out she woke up on the wrong side of the crib too she spent the whole morning fussing , crying , whining and generally making me nuts i guess i felt bad for her too but this is about me right now i can see that several soon to erupt teeth are giving her issues geez why ca n't the teeth just grow the hell in already and be done with it ? ? ? ! ! ! i even burst into tears a few times tiredness really gets to me i get so frustrated when she 's in a constant fuss i yell what do you want me to dooooo ? ? ? ! ! ! what the helllllll ? ? ? ! ! ! i know that 's not nice i just could n't help it she hates being cuddled and my attempts at soothing just piss her off sigh she is quietly napping in her room right now and i'm enjoying a brief respite from the fuss monster i think she 'll feel better after her rest , fingers crossed she 's had her teething tabs and painkillers and whatnot despite it all , i miss her while she sleeps and i still feel lucky let 's just say i'm going to bed early tonight just do n't tell her that or she 'll sabotage it in some way , ok ? save you might also like before and now couch potato hello linkwithin
