i was telling my new girlfriend c the other day that i absolutely do not want to think about the whole bp oil spill debacle disaster tragedy , or whatever the fuck you want to call it thing what a fucking nightmare the thing that really gets me about it is the destruction to the planet and all the animals that are suffering and dying because of it it 's mostly just too painful to go there the other reason i'm not going there is because it totally triggers my nihilistic the human race is a fucking piece of shit and deserves to die kind of thinking , which is a place i'm trying to stay out of more of the time i would usually go on a big rant about what an utterly pathetic , shit species homo sapien is , and how anything that brings our own extinction one step closer is a good thing , blah blah blah anyway , that 's all i'm going to say about it , except for fuck you , bp oil ! fuck you in the ass , you british piece of shit ! ok , seriously , rant is now over one good thing that 's come out of it for me is finding a site called logo my way , which currently has a graphic design contest running for the best creative re imagining of the ubiquitous bp logo that 's plastered all over the whole fucking world check it out here below is my personal favorite , even though i do n't think it 's going to win the contest but , i think the subtle cleverness of it is bewitching
