a pacific storm note the oxymoron has caused a power outage at our place for five days , typical for the mendocino coast in winter thus i have not had an opportunity to blog since i last saw my doctor and lo and behold ! from the depths of darkness a medication adjustment has raised me back to the world of normality for five days now i quit drinking any alcohol and insisted going off of my long acting oral morphine for my chronic disk pain , as either of these could possibly be contributing factors to my unresponsiveness and in tears , telling my doctor what method of suicide i 'd prefer while promising no intent , i said , ca n't we try a stimulant ? so , the doctor put me back on abilify , which had stopped working , and added adderall , a mixture of amphetamine salts i took them the same day and felt better immediately but what do i mean by better ? my depressive thoughts quit circling like sharks in the aquarium of my mind my body felt normal , with normal energy i had hope , i began to think of future plans my crying spells stopped just like that ! amazing my fear is , of course , that this new cocktail , like the two others that worked then ceased working , will cease working as well , or that i 'll develop tolerance or something but maybe , just maybe , the third time is a charm it 's a strange sensation , however , for one 's body and brain to feel normal while the memory of the last nineteen months of horror remains in the center of my chest like a rubble lined pit from a nuclear blast , my heart being ground zero my last post was signed with seven kilorats that 's the highest i 've recorded in this blog , though i 've been lower than that in previous depressions i feel almost plastic in a way , the mood switch being so sudden and my heart still dragging behind me like an anchor i am aware of the former emptiness in my chest but do not acutely experience it my unutterable sadness suddenly feels like a phantom limb suddenly the idea of a god of love seems imaginable to me my religious torment has lifted and in thinking of my correspondence with my christian friend , i have to confess before god and man my disease is more important to me than my religion i ca n't help it if my disease is not controlled i ca n't do faith except in a hollow intellectual sense i ca n't pretend to be more virtuous than this as a man dying of thirst thinks only of water , so the severely depressed thinks only of annihilation , of an end he is beyond hope of getting better but determined , at least in my case , not to kill himself because he remembers , as through a fog , recovering from previous depressions one thing i did to mark this miracle was to reverse my garuda a garuda is an indonesian mask carved in the form of an eagle faced gargoyle , said to be the eagle who is the mount of the god , vishnu , in the hindu pantheon it is meant to keep evil spirits out of a household but i had hung it above my front door facing inwards when we moved into our new place on april , , the day my depression began as a visible sign of improvement , as an incarnation of hope , i have now hung the garuda on the wall facing the door now he looks out at the world and protects me and mine what was best about this change is that my daughter , sarah , was visiting from la and near the end of her stay she got her papa back ! and kathleen got her craig back and i have myself back , though it will take time for me to trust the sensation of being me for those interested in a longer meditation on brain chemistry and personality , i recommend listening to prozac we are all much more chemical than otherwise if you were spared the gene for this devastating illness , you could never give proper thanks for not having it and i am glad for you if you suffer , all i can say is hold on and keep seeking help that 's all i 've done i'm tempted to sign this kiloneutral but am afraid to make such a claim for so short a period of recovery let us hold today 's labeling in abeyance gratefully , ce
