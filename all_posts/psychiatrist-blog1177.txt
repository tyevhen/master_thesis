mia bursts in with breakfast and charges into paul 's kitchen despite his objections she talks quickly and tells of her sexual escapades over the weekend no sleep , she 's drinking a lot , has acrobatic sex with a young band member and then david the cop , a guy she met at a bar paul wants to return to the office and mia says , suggestively , so you want me on the couch ? i'm wondering how safe paul is alone with her mia talks about her relationships with men , it moves back to her relationship with her father i'm and i'm entirely alone who do i have in my life you ? she talks about her loneliness i guess i'm wondering if mia has untreated bipolar disorder ? she 's gone days without sleeping , she 's intrusive , talks rapidly , promiscuous , maybe hypersexual , and her mood is labile paul looks at her behavior from a psychodynamic perspective only , and i 'll wonder if there is n't something biologically driven to it all april is back , she has n't told her mom she has cancer and she has n't gotten any treatment she 's sick , she 's tired her autistic brother , daniel , tried to commit suicide , again she talks about daniel april thinks she 's depressed they talk about this and paul tells april when she feels badly , she should call him , any time of day or night april sounds like the neglected child , her mom gets overwhelmed , she needs to vent april sounds hopeless about daniel 's prognosis paul points out that april will eventually be responsible for caring for daniel , a burden she clearly does n't want , but oops , she may be dead long before such a day arrives paul wants to talk about chemo but daniel calls and april needs to go get him she faints in paul 's office paul gets angry , he screams at her she tells paul , it 's okay that you ca n't handle this , you panicked they scream and shout at each other the phone rings , it 's april 's mother , april stands up to her and says she ca n't go get daniel , and mom hangs up on her they run over on time , april keeps pointing this out and paul keeps saying there is more time what if i come with you to the hospital ? would you ? now ? yes , now he leaves with her and shuts out the lights the episode is advertised in it 's tivo 'd blurb as paul crosses a boundary i thought the boundary was screaming at the patient but he leaves with her , takes her to negotiate cancer care paul is portrayed as human , he 's frustrated and feels helpless his patient is a ticking bomb she 's destined to die if she does n't get care now oh , and maybe even if she does so off to the hospital they go yes , i think it 's the 'right' thing to do , or at least i do n't think it 's 'wrong ' what do you think ? yes , clink , i know it 's a tv show
