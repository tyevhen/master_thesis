for those of you tired of in treatment , there 's a real post below and roy promises me he 's putting up our heated to benzo or not to benzo post today et i'm working on it now r the end of this post talks about the differences between psychotherapy and clinical supervision so paul returns to gina for supervision every word out of her mouth , he jumps on why is he going ? he blames her for encouraging him to terminate with laura , the patient who wants to sleep with him , and he finally admits what we all knew that he does , indeed , fantasize about laura every exchange between paul and gina is charged , aggressive , angry these people want to be in a room together why ? ? they call it supervision and paul talks about his fears that his urologist will think he has small genitalia it all seems more like psychotherapy to me , not supervision angry psychotherapy without a clear agenda and purpose , at that paul is as defensive a supervisee as one could imagine any patient being it 's not fun to have this session on my tv screen , i personally , would n't want this guy in my office did i once say he , as an actor , is hot ? i take it back he started the series as a warm and likable therapist most of what happens on this show , no longer feels like anything that happens in my office for this , i'm grateful one of our readers asked the difference between psychotherapy and supervision psychotherapy well that 's hard enough to define , but let 's just say it 's talk therapy to address a problem we 've been there in lots of posts before it 's all about the patient in supervision , a psychotherapists consults with another psychotherapist , usually someone older wiser , about the treatment of patients supervision implies to me an ongoing process , while consultation can be a one shot deal the topic of discussion is generally limited to the patient and the interactions between the two of them certainly , the supervisee might bring up issues in his own life that feel relevant , but that 's not main focus , and discussions of intimate personal matters are n't generally part of the discussion if the therapist needs that , a formal psychotherapy is more appropriate supervision is n't , by definition , cold or impersonal i always ask people i work with about their personal lives in some form how they are , if they have families , where they went for vacation , and they often ask the same of me if a supervisee has been ill , they may chat about that , but it 's generally determined by how much we 'click' and polite conversation paul and gina , the tv characters , ca n't decide what they 're doing or even why they 're doing it
