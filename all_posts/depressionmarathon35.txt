it was so relieving to write the title to this post i may erase it and write it over and over again i am still in the hospital , but i feel better the first couple of days here were tough i spent the first day and a half in tears , barely speaking , and probably moving even less prior to my admission i was struggling so hard just to stay semi functional and safe once securely here i think i relaxed , and all the pain came pouring out apparently i needed those tears , because things got better from there it was probably early yesterday when i first began noticing an uptick in my mood now i feel a bit lighter i'm not so slow , less quiet , and have a little energy again today i even laughed i know this because one of my nurses was so surprised she pointed it out immediately ! it 's a relief to feel less pain the plan is to go home on monday , which will allow me to begin outpatient transcranial magnetic stimulation tms treatments tuesday after my last experience with tms , i'm feeling very hopeful tms will give me my life back it 's a commitment , monday through friday for weeks , but it 's definitely worth it i 'll be very happy to get out of here and back home this is a safe place , a healing place , and i certainly needed to come in , but it 's not home i 'd be lying if i said i was n't also anxious about going home , but with my improved mood and tms plan , i think i 'll be fine i miss my freedom and routine , getting outside to exercise , and most importantly , i miss jet he 's happy as a clam with his dog sitter , which is great , but i ca n't wait to be reunited with him i want to thank all of you , my readers , over these last weeks you hung in there with me while watching what can only be described as a devastating , slow motion train wreck your comments , especially to some of those painful posts , really helped this is such an isolating illness i always feel better when someone tells me they can relate to something i 've written i'm lucky to have such a wide net of support , locally , nationally , and perhaps even internationally thank you , my friends
