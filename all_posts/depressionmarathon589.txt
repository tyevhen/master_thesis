what is it about banging your hand against the wall that relieves you , she asked ? i do n't know , i said i do n't really understand it myself what i do understand is the shame and humiliation i feel admitting such a practice it does n't happen often it 's actually quite rare but when my depression symptoms drag me into the darkest depths , this shameful compulsion sometimes greets me there despite the fact that many who know me read this blog , and despite my deep shame and humiliation , i am finally writing about it here it 's only taken years but perhaps some of you struggle too maybe letting the cat out of the bag will lessen the power of the thoughts for both of us and lead us down the healthier path perhaps i ca n't sleep i was supposed to leave the hospital after my ect treatment today , but again the treatment team felt i was rushing out the door too soon they did n't like the fact that i was returning home alone late in the afternoon i reluctantly agreed to stay for just one more day and i struggled today , as i had yesterday , with harmful thoughts the compulsion was there and hard to resist it 's embarrassing , and shameful , and difficult to admit easier , it is , just to bang away and stop the feelings whatever the feelings dead in their tracks there is relief in the pain i ca n't stand admitting that what is it about banging you hand against the wall that relieves you , she asked ? i do n't know , i said but i guess i do understand it the very real physical pain stops the very surreal mental anguish it 's easy it 's immediate it 's unhealthy but it works writing it here , admitting my shame to you , is my way , i guess , of reinforcing the healthy coping alternatives i have in my tool chest maybe i'm not alone maybe you 're not alone but from now on , i am committed to reaching for the alternative tools when i am distressed tools which wo n't leave me ashamed and humiliated
