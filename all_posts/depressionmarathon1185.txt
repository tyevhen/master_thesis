another blogger in our mental health community is having a really hard time right now i pray her depression lessens soon she is an asset to our community , and when she 's feeling well , there is n't another blogger who reads more blogs or leaves more supportive comments than she does she 's a friend to many i'm not sure she realizes how much she 's loved by all of her cyber friends i realize cyber friends cannot take the place of real , physically present friends , but sometimes real people let us down my blogging friend wrote a recent post about her disappointment with no return friends no return friends the people with whom we were previously close , but who , for no apparent reason , no longer return our phone calls unfortunately , those of us with mental illness are all too familiar with this unique term those of us with mental illness likely have too many examples of friends who have fallen out of our lives i know i do this phenomena seems to be unique to mental illness it is one of the many reasons i have found depression so isolating no hallmark cards , no pancake breakfasts , no hotdish , and friends who disappear ouch it hurts it 's painful it sucks unfortunately , it 's reality when i speak to the public about my illness , i acknowledge this loss as one of the most difficult in an illness full of painful losses there are probably multiple reasons for this reality , but one suggested reason stirred controversy over on my friend 's blog perhaps , it was suggested , we are n't much fun to be around that is , when my symptoms are raging , perhaps i'm not the brightest , happiest , most positive person to hang out with ! i ca n't argue with that it 's another cruel reality of my illness because the suggestion reflected one of my realities , i did n't find the comment controversial rather , having an explanation for the otherwise inexplicable loss of close friends relieves a bit of my pain it 's like acknowledging depression as an illness versus a character defect the illness lets me off the hook when my depression takes over , i may appear lazy , anti social , irritable , and sad , but that 's not me it 's the illness i am an active , relatively social , pleasant person however , depression urges me to isolate if i do get out , my illness makes socializing nearly impossible , especially if i ca n't separate myself from my symptoms and when i am drowning in symptoms , i ca n't separate depression becomes me i become depression and i imagine , i'm not a whole lot of laughs to hang out with the following is an excerpt from the comment i left on my friend 's blog post most people cannot handle anything other than shiny happy people it is a reflection on their character , not yours it sucks what worked for me when i lost friends i shifted my focus to talking with people who could handle it the professionals in my life when that wasn t enough , i connected with more professionals , the local nami organization , and did more writing i m not suggesting you do any of the above rather , just letting you know how i dealt with the pain of friends falling out of my life those friends originally caused me much pain with their ignorance and absence over time , the pain lessened though it still stings if i allow myself to dwell on it too much this illness sucks it steals everything we know and are comfortable with it steals our soul for me , once i accepted that fact and tried to focus on what i could do , and what i could control vs what i couldn t do or control i e other people my life got a little easier again , just letting you know what has worked for me when i am able to do it ! there are a select few people with whom i confide what is really going on in my life if i am around others outside that select few , i try to look at it as a time of distraction a time to just be in that moment and a distraction from my internal strife but i can only do that when i am in a slightly better space than the deep hole you seem to be in right now when i m feeling like super duper , mega crap i can t handle much of anyone or anything everything i interpret , i interpret in the worst possible light it s a shitty place to be , and i hate it i am praying for you please , please take care of yourself be kind to you and to those around you , and hang on tight ! i hope this is helpful to others out their struggling with the cruel realities of depression and mental illness i 'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences , too to stay alive , i try to remember i have an illness i have an illness which often sucks the life out of me , changes my character , and distorts my personality but i do n't have to let it define me keep fighting , folks do n't let your illness define you click here to read the post which inspired this post
