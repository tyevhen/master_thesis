i came across this link for the tek rmd on the kd uk facebook page http www matiarobotics com tek rmd html the device has some interesting features what interested me most was the one video where the man was able to sit down in an ordinary chair it has been a couple of years since i gave that up i do miss the recliners and watching television from an easy chair they are definitely more comfortable it would be great in the kitchen , especially with the higher cupboards i liked the remote control option you can park it somewhere else after you have transferred to a bed or chair i am also curious how stable it is and , could you comfortably sit back in the seat strap ? operating information the maximum grade of climb is the range is miles km load capacity lbs kg turning radius cm weight empty lbs kg potential issues the small wheels might not work well on carpets or safely drive over small ridges bumps throw rugs might bunch up when turning it is currently designed for a paraplegic hand and arm strength is required for self mounting how much arm strength what kind of pressure does this place on your leg joints ? i will definitely bookmark this webpage and continue to follow the evolution of the device
