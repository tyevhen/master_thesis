i had to post this picture in order to have a url from which to transfer it to my profile 's photo in it i'm younger and thinner but it still bears a fair resemblance to me , and i think it 's not quite so doughty as the others i 've borrowed from various e zines who were good enough to include a photo i'm at about kilorats of depression , where i can work in my garden or schlep lbs of rat food if need be but i still somewhat recoil from any affectionate touching by my wife i fear intimacy and do n't understand why anyone would want to be affectionate towards me i am getting better , i know the signs at times nature almost appears beautiful , but i have as yet no inner response to the sublime , no overawed appreciation of the redwood coast where i live , which my ny raised wife says is the most beautiful place she 's ever seen i can see that it 's beautiful , but the consequent feeling is as yet lacking it will come , i'm sure this has been my worst and longest depression in years , near as i can remember the last one followed a mania and resulted in my last hospitalization and also , eventually , my retirement from medicine this one 's already past three months in duration but the meds seem to be kicking in , thank pfizer ! in view of my hoped for recovery , i 'll need a new measure for feeling above average , or hypomanic , or god forbid , manic for this i propose another rodent , a happy , bouncing , soft , cuddly one a bunny ! mood above the mean will now be measured in kilobunnies i look forward to that day when i tell you , dear reader , that i'm feeling around three kilobunnies thine , ce
