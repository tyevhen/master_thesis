someone recently asked me a difficult question they had suffered a terrible tragedy and loss of a child they said it had shaken their faith , they wondered if there was a god and how could he let it happen and why did it happen to them i suggested two books that might help viktor frankl 's man search for meaning and when bad things happen to good people but she insisted in asking me , but what do you think ? what is your answer ? the only thing i could think of is something that i think is essentially correct we cannot get to truth through the reasoning process because truth is divine and reasoning is human so all we can do is get out of the fear and anxiety caused by our pain and our body being in a state of alarm , and try to get to our essential okayness by meditating on the thought that we can breathe in the white light of healing and love and exhale the darkness of fear and anxiety then when we have succeeded in getting our body out of a state of anxious alarm and are calm for a few minutes , we can open up our heart to love and then , at some point , truth will reveal itself to us and we will have an answer a b curtiss
