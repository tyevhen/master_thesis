recently there was a little problem in one of our local facilities nobody died , but the incident caused the officers in my facility to reminisce about fights they 've had to break up in the past i overheard some of the conversation and the result is this poem , direct from the officers' mouths two of you and the gate is locked guys in the yard , two of you and the gate is locked you had two fights over here , three fights over there , it was like may day it was n't against us , it was bgf but we still had to stop it it was over something small , one guy had a beef that 's when the weapons came out the officer opened the gate to let him out i could n't stand there and see the guy stabbed up they kicked the gate open that 's how the fight got to the compound you gotta contain it the gates lock you ai n't going no where they hit the doors , you contain it you ai n't going no where you in there
