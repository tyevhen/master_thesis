i want to tell you about how primal need works first , a story in today s paper about a man who failed at sports but from the time his son was eight years old , he forced him into sports and even when the child and he was a child was hurt , he demanded he get up and play on he broke a tooth but the father never saw the little hurts because he only could see himself , and when his child was cheered on later in sports the father somehow felt they were also cheering for him in short , he lived his life and his needs through his son his needs came long before the ones of his son he was effectively having an ineffable primal where he relived the failures of his life and his need to be a winner , through his son the son never had a chance another story of a patient , a lawyer , who was ignored and derided by his father as someone who could never do anything right the father continued to criticize and demean him , so he himself could feel a little bit of success at the expense of his son the son was treated like dirt , he said and so with his clients the son was supercilious , arrogant , totally sure of himself and could not allow himself to be questioned he was the important person , and with his clients those old pains seeped through constantly the feeling of being nothing forced him to act like he was something , someone important and valued his manner of arrogant speech was the betrayal of his past hurt and denigration he did not try to speak in a superior fashion his old need pain importuned it his old feelings colored the tone of his speech and offered a protective cover against his feeling like a failure his work could not be put in question he ran from criticism and could be bought for just a few words of praise his flight was constantly away from his pain he avoided anyone who was critical , and socialized with those who praised him and reinforced his worth that was as unending as his need pain , which was locked into his brain what he sought out was always symbolic , someone who thought he was important , those who genuflected before his superior intelligence and , of course , he cultivated that intelligence so he could be idolized but as his need was interminable , so was his act out i remember in my old days of primal , i would take someone who was brash and aggressive and loud in his speech and demand he speaks only softly and timidly he would soon cry feeling unprotected , weak , and alone in both cases , old feelings and needs superseded reality just like a woman i treated , who could only get involved with strong men because her father was so weak he could not protect her against a constantly angry , miserable mother , who blamed her daughter for all her failures and ailments the mother was as unrelenting with her daughter as her internal misery of course the mother had no idea where her misery came from , so she focused on a vulnerable and defenseless target her daughter that daughter paid a lifelong price for her mother s pain when the husband left home , the mother blamed the daughter , if you weren t born , he would had stayed with me the daughter had implacable guilt and began to feel like the failure her mother instilled in her later on , she got married and became the guilt laden miserable being she was made into do not ever think that a bit of counseling would help her overcome her character flaws behavior therapists confine themselves to the present because it is so easy to travel in those confines , which limits their scope and therefore their field of required knowledge they see only obvious behavior , while a long childhood history lies unexamined if this were applied to geography , the world would indeed be flat
