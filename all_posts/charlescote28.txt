song dance , houghton mifflin , alan shapiro a review of alan shapiro 's song dance houghton mifflin , by charles cot as in plato 's allegory of the cave , we all face a blank wall when confronted with death , most so when that death involves someone close to us poetry may be our attempt to ascribe form to shadow , the closest we come to reality when passing by that fire perhaps chained to their own cave , the two boys do n't suspect they do n't exist this , the opening lines of alan shapiro 's song dance , transform to a record spinning beneath a needle , a poignant elegy , the first of many about his brother 's death from a brain tumor the poems in this collection keen in every sense of the word the first poem , everything the traffic will allow , based on klea blackhurt 's ethel merman tribute , recollects a time when alan and his brother david performed there 's no business like show business to an audience of two , their delighted parents propped on pillows in their bedroom , the boys casting their own shadows in that moment , just the shade of a shade did you ever really have a brother ? , one of the many questions posed throughout the book , questions shapiro answers aslant , questions he seems to ignore , questions with no direct answers , like death , unknowable , and yet experienced in all its brutal honesty this question , an echo in my own encephalitic cave , did i ever really have a son ? in the title poem , song dance , shapiro addresses that question of existence and his connection to family , grounded in hunger and the anticipation of food cooking in the kitchen , the hunger 's sweet he remembers his brother 's voice and this helps him answer the question , how i answer the question i listen again to his singing , sing , and am fed these poems are stunning , sensual , empathic and brutal c k williams calls them luminous , mark doty , harrowing , and tom sleigh , sensitive and tough minded i read them in one sitting and felt the sweet , sad hunger inviscerate me in transistor radio , we get the bloated , stroke crippled indigent body of his grandmother set against the curvy bright white trellis carved from cloud of the roller coaster and a vast lair of languid animals , or young gods stretching , young sun bathers listening to music on the beach all the while , we embody our own cave of shadows in these poems , and like the body , inhabit a container for the poet 's grief , his pleasure dome and torture chamber in to the body , shapiro describes our existential vessel , how pleasure and pain travel the same path the nerve of it all ! we 're all trapped and alone , and by this we take comfort in this together , or as existential psychotherapist irving yalom says , it 's good to see the other lights bobbing up an down in the harbor at night these poems , like wine jars , jewels , and honey cakes , baubles and trinkets in the sun king 's tomb all carry our hopes and anguish , like part one of gregory orr 's concerning the book that is the body of the beloved describes and so i come to the book , which is also the body of the beloved and so i come to the poem the poem is the world scattered by passion , then gathered together again so that we may have hope i will return to song dance again and again , like i will listen again and again for the ones i 've lost , while i burn and burn in this caloric body , at once the fire eating the wood and the wood that , burning , eats the fire i will revel in shapiro 's song , as i do in orr 's , as i do in my own son 's , and by that reveling , life will be revealed as it passes by the fire in shadow
