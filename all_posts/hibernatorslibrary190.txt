as mentioned in my opening post about personality disorders , personality disorders are split into three clusters a , b , and c this post will discuss the cluster a personality disorders cluster a disorders are characterized by distrust , suspiciousness , and social detachment often , people with cluster a personality disorders are considered eccentric or odd the characteristic traits of paranoid personality disorder are suspiciousness and mistrust of others , tendency to see oneself as blameless , and tendency to be on guard for perceived attacks by others the disorder develops in early adulthood to be diagnosed , a person must exhibit or more of traits he suspects , without sufficient basis , that others are exploiting , harming , or deceiving him he is preoccupied with unjustified doubts about the loyalty or trustworthiness of friends or associates he is reluctant to confide in others because of unwarranted fear that the information will be used maliciously against him he reads hidden demeaning or threatening meanings into benign remarks or events he persistently bears grudges he perceives attacks on his character or reputation that are not apparent to others and is quick to react angrily he has recurrent suspicions , without justification , regarding fidelity of spouse or partner of course , i am unqualified to diagnose anyone with a personality disorder , but i think real life stories are helpful when i worked in retail , there was a guy that i had a crush on we had been friends for almost a year , and i figured it was ok to tell him i liked him he freaked out and said that i 'd betrayed him because he was n't ready to date anyone due to a bad experience in the past he soon became incredibly paranoid he accused me to the manager first of stalking him within the store , then of calling his phone number just to hear the sound of his voice mind you , this guy never handed his phone number out to anyone , so he was basically accusing me of sneaking into the office and illicitly looking up his number , and finally , he accused me of placing a kilo of marijuana near his car though he could n't produce said kilo for evidence looking back , i realized his behavior had been odd all along he was huge on conspiracy theory stockpiled guns thought everyone was out to get him did n't tell anyone where he lived , what his phone number was , or any personal details about his past and he accused me of being nasty and demeaning when i made a casual comment oh , you 've already started christmas shopping ? seems a bit early and boy could he hold a grudge since then , i 've wondered what happened to this guy he was really a sweet , caring person i worry about his health and safety , since his paranoia clearly had a huge negative impact on his life this is one of the personality disorders that would be abolished if the next dsm adopts a dimensional approach as discussed in my previous post i wonder what category these traits would fall into then ? schizoid personality disorder is characterized by impaired social relationships and low desire to form attachments to others to be diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder , a patient must have of the following traits he neither desires nor enjoys close relationships , including being part of a family he almost always chooses solitary activities he has little , if any , interest in having sexual experiences with another person he takes pleasure in few , if any , activities he lacks close friends or confidants other than first degree relatives he appears indifferent to the praise or criticism of others he shows emotional coldness , detachment , or flattened affectivity this is another personality disorder that would disappear with the dimensional approach people with schizotypal personality disorder are also loners people with scizotypal personality disorder tend to have superstitious beliefs , and some experience psychotic symptoms like believing they have magical powers they can also be paranoid , have distorted speech , or see special meaning in ordinary objects or events schizotypal personality disorder is thought to be related to schizophrenia perhaps a less severe manifestation or a precursor to schizophrenia in order to be diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder , a patient must have five or more of the following traits he has ideas of reference believing innocuous events or objects have strong personal meaning he almost always chooses solitary activities he has unusual perceptual experiences mild hallucinations he has odd thinking and speech e g vague , circumstantial , metaphorical , overelaborate , or stereotyped he exhibits suspiciousness or paranoid ideation he has inappropriate or constricted affect his behavior or appearance is odd or eccentric he has a lack of close friends or confidants other than first degree relatives he has excessive social anxiety this is the only cluster a personality disorder that would not be lost if we switched to the dimensional approach of diagnosis this is a series of posts summarizing what i'm learning in my abnormal psychology course much of the information provided comes from reading my james n butcher 's textbook abnormal psychology to read the other posts , follow these links the definition of abnormal a history of abnormal psychology abnormal psychology in contemporary society contemporary viewpoints on treating mental illness biology contemporary viewpoints on treating mental illness psychology frontline new asylums brave new films this is crazy clinical mental health diagnosis biological assessment clinical mental health diagnosis psychological assessment does the dsm encourage overmedication ?
