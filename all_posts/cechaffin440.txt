redwoods cathedrals come to mind when the soft light , refracted through the needles like stained glass , leaks down from these great trees from a great height their bark is thick and grooved and will not blight their fallen fronds , acidic , allow no grass cathedrals come to mind when they shape light i look up and the tops are out of sight my mind cannot encompass their great mass light leaks down through these trees from a great height i love an oak , i love its tortured might maples burn gold and rose when leaves must pass but they are not cathedrals to the light straight as a rod , vertically impolite to man , who feels a bug beside their mass , the light leaks down through these from a great height i want to stay here like an anchorite and worship at their base while all things pass cathedrals come to mind when the soft light leaks down from these great trees from a great height like yesterday , it s a good sign when dr chaffin writes about things outside himself in general i am no introvert , but depression forces me into a smaller and smaller space until i m afraid to speak with my wife , until making coffee becomes an overwhelming burden but you have been there with me , and your support even if only the knowledge that i am being read , that i am not simply a mute smudge on the windshield of the universe has meant a lot did that last over the top trope remind you of roc mckuen ? my new psychiatrist was quite knowledgeable , to my relief he is the second psychiatrist i ve seen in my life who knows more about medications than i do in view of my recent improvement since doubling the seroquel , he opted not to change a thing , but asked me to return in a month or call him if i start to cycle down again what s interesting is that in this small community i remember him from the men s retreat there i told him that he emanated the most joy of anyone i met at the affair he just smiled back as i said to kathleen , a happy psychiatrist is either very healthy or in denial i think my new shrink is actually healthy amazing so few psychiatrists are naturally , as that rare , truly competent doctor , to get an appointment with him takes over two months but he has a walk in clinic when he is on call , and that s how i was able to see him not much else to report kathleen is under the weather but i am never allowed to give details she has a stronger sense of privacy than i my sense of privacy has been blown out by multiple hospitalizations and events , if i described them , that are beyond embarrassment what otheres think of me is none of my business i tell the truth and let the chips fall where they may i have a better poem on redwoods than the villanelle above , and i ll post it below in shape it resembles a redwood by design see the poet george herbert for more such poems at rodent neutral ? ce red wood standing on the burnt tripod of your fire hollowed base like a saturn rocket waiting for launch , your faraway limbs radiate like bent spokes bearing needles tighter than a comb s teeth to hide your crown like the face of a god , just as you hide the sun from the laurel and the fir what light you spare won t penetrate the bleached rust carpet of needles below where blue jays strut , squawking indecorously beside your unearthly stillness your peat red bark is grooved as if some prehistoric cat had clawed it lengthwise your roots , big as pythons , suck up the silt from all those moss furred wrecks that splinter into orange sawdust , your ancestors without them you d go hungry in this rain forest flushing minerals faster than roots can taste only the outermost of your two thousand rings is alive , a thin cylinder of cells wrapping your heartwood like foil your strength comes from your core and your core is dead your seeds , smaller than a fly s wings , share a lotto s chance of sprouting in your shade more often your own shoots encircle you as you die to feed them , rising in a cathedral cool and still and vertical around your stump s altar published in mi poesias
