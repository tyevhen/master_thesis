in continuing with religion , spirituality and psychology , today 's post will be focused on the role of spirituality and psychology in regards to the previous post , there was little literature on the psychological effects of religion and psychology however , there was a bit more didactic literature of spirituality and psychology on the web everybody in their yoga positions ? spirituality and psychology as mentioned above , there is not too much concrete information on the effects of spirituality that i was able to obtain , although there is a lot that can be said about the interconnection of therapy and spirituality dr stephen diamond wrote an article in psychology today , the psychology of spirituality , stated that psychotherapy , when properly practiced , is an inherently spiritual venture understanding the psychology of spirituality is of tremendous importance to psychotherapy today in the final analysis , the task of both psychotherapy and spirituality is to accept and redeem rather than avoid , deny , cast out , eradicate or exorcise our devils and demons by bravely facing our inner demons symbolizing those scary , shameful , primitive , uncivilized , irrational , unconscious complexes , emotions , passions and tendencies we most fear , flee from , and hence , are obsessed or haunted by we transmute them into helpful spiritual allies i find this to be so poignant and true , especially with those who consider themselves spiritual for those who do consider them self spiritual , one could say you have a mini therapy session everyday whether in prayer or meditation with your god i found a short video from the 's i believe that interviewed a frances vaughan , ph d who is a psychologist , educator and author of books , chapters and articles on psychology and spirituality its not that long and if you have to spare take a look i do n't think we will ever truly understand spirituality 's place in psychology , mainly because i do n't think we will fully understand spirituality as a whole it may be interesting to make a mental note of how we all view spirituality in our own lives a bit differently but at the same time , quite similarly part iii i interviewed rabbi simcha feuerman , lcsw r , who is a rabbi as well as a private practitioner in new york we will talk to him about religion and its role in mental health and psychotherapy stay tuned have a good oneor two or even three yes
