i wrote this post , am i depressed or just lazy , some time ago at the time it was really a rhetorical question i believed that i was about equal doses of each the post was really about me trying to poke myself into action if one admits a personal foible in public then he will be more conscious of it and therefore more corrective of it in the future , right ? but perhaps i'm not as lazy as i thought perhaps i'm more depressed than i 've believed here 's why i say that that little post has become one of the most popular on the blog thanks to search engines and it turns out that a lot of people have this same question , am i depressed or lazy ? i 've been noticing this for months and wondering what i could do about it i'm certainly not equipped to deal with anyone else 's problems nor would i presume to offer advice but i know how to find some people who are so equipped so i thought i 'd track down a blogging psychologist that might answer some questions about this issue should be interesting reading and it might even help some of those readers that find the pursuit of happiness after trying to resolve their own laziness vs depressiveness so help me out i jotted down a few questions but they do n't seem to get to the root of it where does this question come from ? what is the apparent connection that many of us feel between the symptoms of depression and simple laziness ? it strikes me that only a depressed person would come up with this question someone who is simply lazy would likely not confuse his or her condition with depression do you agree or disagree ? why ? what would you suggest to someone who is asking him or herself this question ? what else should i ask ? and anyone know of a pro that could expertly answer these questions ? all suggestions welcome
