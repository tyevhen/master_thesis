it 's someone 's mantra the number one barrier to getting mental health treatment is stigma maybe it 's true and i'm not looking at the research , i'm writing from my own impressions it 's my blog i'm going to suggest that the barriers to getting mental health treatment are access half of all counties in the us do n't have a mental health professional i saw that on twitter , so it must be that 's any mental health professional , not just psychiatrists access if there 's somewhere to go there may be many weeks to wait people do n't like to wait and some of those people just wo n't make appointments far off some will feel better before they actually get in and wo n't show up cost over half of psychiatrists do n't participate with insurance , the upfront cost of care is very expensive , and insurance companies vary in how well they reimburse out of network care and wo n't tell you what they reimburse before you file the claim which they may or may not lose or reject shame or embarrassment , so stigma the urgings of others who disapprove of the use of medications , do n't believe in psychiatrists , do n't want to foot the bill for relatives , do n't want to take off work to drive a relative to appointments distrust of psychiatrists and the pharmaceutical industry somehow , we 've become a culture that believes that if you say end stigma you 're doing something to end stigma or that if you come out and announced all the awful things your mental illness has led you to do , that this ends stigma bill boards are big or that if you 're a politician who says we need to end stigma while passing stigmatizing laws , that you 're ending stigma so what decreases stigma when successful celebrities announce that they 've struggled with mental illness , particularly if they have not made a spectacle of themselves and if they have n't led chaotic lives when andrew solomon talks about his struggles with depression , as he rakes in his many writing awards and gives his incredible ted talks , that 's destigmatizing brittany spears not so much when regular people talk about their struggles with mental illness especially if they are employed , married , and living productive lives this wo n't be popular but television commercials for pharmaceutical agents and direct to consumer advertising it 's everywhere someone must be taking those medications and the ads normalize it it may be bad for all sorts of other reasons , but in terms of decreasing stigma , they help parity for insurance so that mental health treatments are n't different less than 'real' medical conditions what increases stigma anything that alters civil rights based upon the existence of a mental health diagnosis in the absence of a troublesome behavior so laws that restrict the purchase of guns by people with a mental health diagnosis , even if they 've never done anything dangerous or threatening or proposed laws that want to say that people with a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder should be the only people who ca n't forbid their treatment team from releasing their diagnostic and treatment information to their family caretaker comments about keeping guns out of the hands of crazies 'nuff said linking mental illness with mass murder i think i actually have never had a patient who has expressed any sense that being in psychiatric treatment in any way associates them with someone who does heinous things but it ca n't be a good association fears of being made coerced into to take medications when you do n't want to take them and the concern that one 's autonomy and individual decisions wo n't be respected who wants to sign on for that ? the side effects of our medicines there 's nothing desirable about being overweight , having metabolic syndrome , being sedated , having a tremor , or having other movement disorders the devastation associated with untreated mental illness unmet potential , sometimes unemployability , homelessness or being stuck in a parent 's basement , incarceration , poor hygiene , odd behaviors so what did i miss ? i'm skeptical about the idea that modern family 's halloween episode with scary 'mental patients ' actually increases stigma it 's a historical stereotype and it 's too outrageous to feel like anything accurate but i certainly do understand that this is very offensive i'm just not sure that all that is offensive is stigmatizing by all means , feel free to correct me here and feel free to add to the list
