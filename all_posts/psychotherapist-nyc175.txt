wrong because dan seemed so distracted when he was around her when she asked him about it , he made up an excuse and went out for a walk dan felt that his obsessive thoughts were becoming overwhelming , especially since he was thinking more and more about trying to contact karen the thought of contacting her made him feel excited and scared at the same time he did n't know what he would say to her

heard a word that she had said at first , he felt embarrassed , but then when he saw the hurt look on his face , he felt sad and guilty marie asked him if he was having an affair when he told her no ,

were in bed and marie approached him , he knew that he was n't in the mood to make love to her , but he did n't dare say no the only way that he was able to make love to her was by thinking about how
