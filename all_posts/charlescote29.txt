having just read alan shapiro 's elegies for his brother david who died from brain cancer song dance , mariner books , , i feel compelled to let my son sing out as well alan 's brother was an actor on broadway , and had a great sense of humor , even in the midst of in his own tragedy he sang out in the revels as alan points out in last impressions , the last poem in the collection , and by that singing , celebrated his life , our life , revealing , as all poems do , the essentials of existence look for my upcoming review of shapiro 's book from my son 's journal , found soon after he died from melanoma at age while not comedic , these sing out their own revelations october st , the day he died what you are is a miracle that has graced my heart for what reason i do n't know the way you live is a lyrical work of art and i ca n't look away november , it s like blowing in the wind , the leaves in the fall can t stop me if i drift , blending into it all but let s face it , we re all dying a little bit everyday till we end up back where we belong let s all dance into our graves certainty is the cage that keeps us safe from curiosity i ve been released from the cage i am the songbird and i am flying for the window i know it s closed , but i plan on breaking through it s funny how we call survival a blessing when death would be so much greater i m still waiting for the answers to come falling at my feet i ll pick them up and look them over but all i m going to see is that no one knows the answers april , brown and blue eyes brown eyes , if you re listening in there , i m sure you re aware that time is on your side , but not if you throw it away with regret blue eyes , if i choose to compare , you ll notice i stare you re everything i needed just pull me through just pull me through i promise that i ll beat it here 's charlie singing brown eyes september , wings i want to be the passenger let someone else drive because i ve got enough to do so girlfriend s got her wings there are better things than falling in love , like being loved and loving someone there are better things than having control living out your soul find that someone it s such a difficult burden to carry , but it is also a motivating one while cancer usually associates with a looming of death , it also provokes a will to live i am always encouraged by my parents and girlfriend , who have been my greatest supporters since my diagnosis , to fight even when i am exhausted from treatments because i am loved march , death cab relying on uncertainties , ignoring statistics using just my fingertips to measure all the distance between now and when its over revised april , look up look up , it just might surprise you i think we ve found your cure don t know where we re going doesn t matter , why do we need to be so sure ? where we re going it s a better place but i can t say for sure either way , don t we know it s for the better ? and there s no need to feel so insecure the cure is the disease that brings everyone around you caring for what they don t understand , helping with the load that s just too heavy to carry alone it s like a coffin we re all on a handle the second it drops is the one we all fall down don t cry now don t cry ever dehydration is far too clever , empties your eyes and leaves you tired journal entry whenever people level with me and say how hard it must be for me to endure these harsh treatments , and that they admire my spirit and strength , i usually want to reply that these treatments are hardly brutal and are all worthwhile if they mean that i get to spend more time on earth with all the people i love and who have shown so much caring love throughout my life and this treatment it is almost impossible for me to refrain from tears every time i think about the incredible amount of love people have shown me and if this experience has shown me anything , i think it s shown me that god encourages us all to love in so many ways , even in tragedy it s incredible how many people i don t even know have shown me love and kept me in their prayers also , as tacky as it sounds , i think that if people could give everyone the love that i have received so gracefully , then the world would be such a better place to live in journal entry i think , normally , when someone knows that they re going to die , that the typical thing for everyone else to do is prepare themfor death i think , in my case , and hopefully any other faithful person s , that it s much more appropriate to prepare the others who must deal with the person s death i ll try to leave you with everything you need i ll be taken care of when i get where i m going journal entry so i was thinking today , after hearing about julie lynch s sort of self realization coming to terms with life experience , that i m not sure what conclusions i ve come to about life i know i ve learned a lot of valuable lessons and such over the past year , but i don t feel so wise as the people you read about or hear about that come to complete terms with life and death and find profound understanding i think what i ve ultimately found is that there isn t much that can be understood especially when it comes to what i m experiencing now maybe that means that all those other guys were just making stuff up to sound or feel profound , themselves cuz i have to admit , i think i d feel a little more complete , myself , if i could bring myself and those around me to a new level of understanding one that would ultimately allow us to better cope with all this maybe i feel obligated even journal entry last entry i don t like feeling pain i hate showing my pain even more , though i don t like having people worry about every ache , pain , or cough i feel sure , i am grateful for their concern , because every once in a while , i do need help i just feel like my state of health affects others states of emotion or happiness i wish i could ignore the pain so they wouldn t have to see it and worry so much okay , i can t keep my eyes open any longer cancer , by brian moore spray insulation and oil on panel , , for charlie
