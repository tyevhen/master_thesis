the les roberts gilbert burnham team is stirring up trouble again , shining a light on the number of iraqi deaths attributable to the american aka coalition of the willing invasion their number , iraqi deaths above what would have been expected prior to the war this differs substantially from our great leader s estimate of about , , more or less , mentioned by bush in december i ve not yet seen the study , as it is due to hit the lancet website on thursday i m going to be all over it , examining its methodology and discussing it in more depth i am very familiar with this group s first study , which estimated at the low end that about , iraqis died in about the first year post invasion why a low estimate ? because they came to that number by excluding falluja from the analysis they figured that so many people had died in falluja that including it would bias their sample including falluja would have brought their figures to about , dead the researchers reportedly used cluster sampling again in the new study , which is the same method used in the prior study it is the appropriate method when investigating such topics as this in the first and i m guessing also in the latest study , they randomly selected a number of clusters areas to visit , then were randomly assigned to neighborhoods in these areas through random numbers entered into their gps systems they went to the nearest houses and knocked on doors , collecting data regarding deaths prior to the invasion starting until the start of the invasion and post invasion they requested death certificates to confirm the report of death from a relatively small number of families , and these certificates were provided over of the time in the new study , they were reportedly provided over of the time when requested you may ask why they did not request death certificates from everyone consider that it may be considered disrespectful and could result in danger to the researchers to ask for confirmation of household deaths a test of the american media is coming will it dare report these figures ? if it does , can they resist the temptation to include accompanying commentary from a republican blowhard who moans about how this study is just politics , is biased , and just an attempt by liberals to embolden the enemy ? when the war was relatively popular in , the media did not linger long on roberts et al s findings , preferring to refer to other sources such as www iraqbodycount net for its reports of total iraqi dead would the american people support a war in which an estimated , iraqis have lost their lives ? granted , many of the deaths are due to insurgent and sectarian violence but remember that such groups were not killing people prior to the invasion saddam was one bad apple , but even he likely could not have dreamed of replicating this type of chaos and killing summaries of the study available here and here update the new study just posted on the lancet 's site more upcoming , hopefully soon
