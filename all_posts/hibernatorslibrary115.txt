the reluctant romantic hosted by doing dewey this is the first weekly check in for the the reluctant romantic challenge what genre are you reading this month ? this month i am reading modernist literature before this month , i knew very little about modernist philosophy literature , and as far as i know i 've only read one book in the genre the trial , by franz kafka and i read that years ago before i was able to understand the philosophy though the book was awesome ! why do you want to give this genre a chance ? originally , i was thinking of romance , mystery , or law political thriller genres because i do n't read very much of those but as i looked at those tags in librarything , i realized that i 'd read more than i thought i had in each of those genres then i realized that i already planned on reading at least one virginia wolf book this month for the woolfalong i looked at the modernist tag under librarything and discovered a complete lack of modernist literature under my belt how convenient ! i guess i 've always been hesitant to read it because i'm so unfamiliar with the philosophy have you read any books in this genre yet this month ? i have already reviewed mrs dalloway , by virginia woolf currently , i'm working on the reivers , by william faulkner , since it is one of his pulitzer prize winners i have also listened to the first lectures of two teaching company courses , one on literary modernism , and one on nietzsche whose philosophy strongly influenced modernist thinking i wrote summaries of both lectures literary modernism lecture the will to power lecture are you enjoying your new genre so far ? well , as you can tell by my review of mrs dalloway , i had to read a description of the plot on wikipedia in order to figure out what was going on but once i 'd done that , the listening went much more smoothly i enjoyed my first book , but i'm not going to judge the whole genre based on one book
