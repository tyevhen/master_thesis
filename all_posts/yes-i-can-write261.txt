how did we ever decide to deliver our children to strangers with questionable skills during the best hours of the day ? in the same way , we agreed to have the birthing process taken away from us by the medical profession in the same way , we agreed to have our dying taken away by this same profession and the directors of funeral homes in the same way , we agreed to be satisfied consumers of processed food that has been so far removed from its original state that it is unrecognizable , consumers of biased information , misleading and enticing advertising for things like disposable gadgets in the same way , we have agreed to accept the authority of the state mommy who watches over us for the sake of our children by l andre bergeron , translated by pamela levac this is a book about unschooling but this is not a book just about unschooling it s a book about attachment parenting , respectful parenting about sustainable living and farming it even has a good sized fistful of politics thrown in ! in short , this is a book about one man s life , led trusting and respecting both his daughters and the world around him l andre bergeron comes from an interesting background born in manitoba , educated at a catholic school in the hopes that he d one day become a missionary priest , and eventually becoming a teacher , his rebellious nature led him to put all that behind him and move with his wife to rural quebec it s there , on their homestead , that his three daughters were born , and there that the story truly begins l andre shares , in the pages of a journal he kept for a year , his daily life spent with his three teenage daughters , the flowing rhythms of their days that move with the seasons he shares memories of the past , stories of raising his daughters from the time they were babies , stories of their business a health food store , the circle of life on their farm he also shares his very strong opinions on childrearing , education and schooling , and the processed lives so many people live in this modern world his words are insightful , his writing poetic and flowing , and thus this book was a joy to read i found it interesting that in most books on unschooling , i find myself nodding in agreement with pretty much everything , whereas in this book , my opinions where more mixed much of the stuff he has to say i agree with fully but there was a fair bit that made me pause , and seriously consider my stance on the matter not for anything huge , just at small points throughout the book this , i believe , instead of taking away from the experience , actually added something to my reading of this book i did find myself wanting to hear more about the entire family , mom included , because she was mentioned only briefly throughout the book however , most of what i ve read on unschooling seems to be like that , only usually it s entirely from the mother s perspective just one parent s interactions with their children , not how their family works as a whole , so that isn t really unique to this book that said , i found it a very pleasant change to read a book , talking about hands on attachment parenting and unschooling , not just the theory , written by a father that subject seems to be covered almost exclusively by mothers ! i also really liked that this book was about a family in my home province and current residence ! of quebec the translation was great , as you d never know that it was originally written in another language from reading it , yet at the same time the book felt very quebecois ! definitely a good read , and a good addition to any book collection on attachment parenting , sustainable living , unschooling , or homeschooling peace , idzie you might also like review of a rule is to break a child 's guide to anarchy review of reasons why i'm an unschooler review of the teenage liberation handbook ways to help someone love reading linkwithin
