i had a date last night it 's been a long time since i had a date we met for the first time yesterday afternoon at a local establishment he had a beer and popcorn i had a coke and popcorn after three hours of talking , it appeared we were hitting it off just fine he 's a nice guy well established mature with two kids it was kind of nice to be out i so rarely do anything like that i think there will be a second date i was worried , as i always am , about meeting someone new with a convoluted history as long as mine well , it 's not exactly a selling point i got more worried when he began talking about his ex wife , who had an eating disorder , and one of the women he 's dated recently , who had bi polar disorder he was n't exactly complimentary of either woman 's illness , and he definitely had bad experiences with each one i decided to leave my immediate history hidden , for now , right then and there hiding any part of me is not how i typically proceed , and i hope i 've not disappointed anyone with that decision i did tell him i was in recovery i 'd rather he get to know me before he makes any decisions about me i figured if he knew i had depression up front , we 'd probably never have gotten to the getting to know me stage maybe he 'll drop me like a hot potato once i'm more forthcoming with him , but i figure that says more about him than me i do n't know it 's so hard to know how people will react to any type of mental illness history the stigma out there is so great what 's interesting is this guy sees a therapist , so he 's gotten past some of that stigma he also has some education about mental illness , but he 's definitely still got some stereotyped ideas maybe i'm being a fool even considering a second date but then again , it 's been an awful long time since i 've had a second date ! right now i plan to take it a moment at a time , enjoy it for what it is , and go from there
