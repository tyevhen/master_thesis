i have n't played with jetpack all that much since i last wrote about it i did write a script that collects all the urls and page titles of all open firefox tabs and displays them in a table , so that i can save the table and be able to return to a given tab configuration any time i want right now i just save the page to disk manually but a proper implementation would use jetpack 's persistence api and a nice ui to make the process easier but that got me thinking why is it firefox does n't already offer this capability ? first let 's define what we 're talking about i'm thinking there should be a special name an agreed upon technical term for a particular collection of open tabs in a browser the name i propose is simply ensemble at the moment , i have tabs open in firefox the blogger editing window , twitter 's search page , the mozilla jetpack contest page , and google i should be able to save this configuration off as a named collection let 's call it the tabs for that jetpack followup blog that 's an ensemble tomorrow at this time i might very well have tabs open , including cmswire com , several cms watch pages , central desktop which we use a lot at cms watch , files anywhere ditto , google calendar , gmail , and who knows what else at the moment , in my day job , i'm doing a bit of writing about oracle universal content management , and yesterday i had six different pdfs ucm documentation open in firefox tabs , plus all the usual nonsense i 'd like to be able to capture all of those tabs as one named collection , one ensemble , that i can passivate and reanimate later , at my leisure am i missing something ? can firefox already do this ? yes yes , i realize that i can quit firefox and have my current tab configuration saved for the next time i start firefox , but that 's not at all the same as saving off different named , tagged ensembles saving them at any time , not just quitting time that i can choose to reinstate later i know there are services out on the web where i can dump collections of bookmarks that 's not what i want i want to do everything from within firefox at any rate , the code i'm using right now to get the titles and urls of all open tabs and display them in a table onscreen looks like this jetpack tabs onready rendertablist function rendertablist doc var trigger page tabs htm var tabs jetpack tabs var currenturl doc location href if currenturl indexof trigger page return only fire when tabs htm loads var markup table for var i i tabs length i var title tabs i contentdocument find title text var url tabs i url if url indexof trigger page ! url indexof about ! continue do n't include ourselves function shorten str , limit str length limit ? str substring , limit str title shorten title , var visibleurl shorten url , markup tr markup td title td markup td visibleurl link url td markup tr markup table doc find 'div' html markup it 's ugly code and i'm sure it can be improved in a hundred different ways , but hey , it 's just a proof of concept , so if it blows up no one loses their hands i wrote the shorten macro , btw , before i realized jetpack had an ellipsify method in conjunction with the script , i use a dummy html page called tabs htm that just contains a single div in the body that 's where i attach the table of results nothing special , i know how about you ? have you written any jetpack code lately ? are you entering the contest ? if so , please tell me about it i 'd like to know what you 're doing and what your impressions are of jetpack so far my overall impression of jetpack remains positive i'm anxious to see where it 'll take us next
