in the out patient mental health clinics in maryland , regulations make it clear any patient on medication must be seen by a psychiatrist every days , patients who are not on medications are seen by the psychiatrist every six months this assumes the patient is stable and all is going well , and certainly some docs in some clinics see the patients more often , but a minimum is regulated in the world of private practice , it 's less clear if patients are in psychotherapy , it 's easy enough to deal with medications during a regularly scheduled appointment but what about the patients who are done with therapy , who feel good , who want to continue on their medication ? some patients are fine with coming in monthly , others clearly do n't want to , and if things are really stable , i'm happy to see folks every three months , the standard of the clinic there are people though , who really do n't want to come in that often , where it 's a hassle for them to get off work sometimes their pharmacies start calling for refills with the mail order pharmacies , this can include twice daily phone calls and repeated faxes and there is no contact from the patient i 've taken to ignoring these calls especially the ones from the mail order pharmacies who want okay 's for a month supply if i have n't seen the patient in a long time because returning them often involves a long time in voicemail hell to convey the message , the patient needs to call me patients know to call me if they are having problems , i 'll get them in soon but for someone who does n't want to come in , who says they are fine , i'm still not sure how often to insist on face to face contact here and there someone pops up who i 've long ago assumed was gone if someone is to call me in months , and they do n't , i do n't always remember to chase them down and when i do , sometimes they 've stopped their meds , or asked their internist for a prescription so is there an absolute answer ? is there an absolute minimum that a patient needs to be seen for a refill ? internists prescribe for a year a a time , and so do some psychiatrists i think what 's your thoughts ?
