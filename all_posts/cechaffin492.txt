a few days ago i switched my blog to the new beta version , mainly because it was the only way i found to resurrect my blog from the bad formatting by which it was temporarily afflicted now there 's a new problem i ca n't comment at my friends' non beta blogs , which i tried to do i could n't post because the beta does n't completely recognize the prior version for interaction if you have trouble reading or posting to this site , please send me a note at cechaffin gmail com also , those who have recently written me should be advised patience , as my hotmail account is still being held hostage and i ca n't access it any questions ? as we age the tables turn avoiding pain becomes more pleasurable than seeking pleasure if you 're you 'll understand it that 's where i'm at with my back and my bipolarity i prefer the term , manic depression , of course , because it gives the experience of the disease while bipolar pretends to scientific neutrality this is not a neutral disease it 's very much either or , for or against you could say bush is bipolar on the war on terror as for the personal , i'm at kilorats , though my brother thinks i'm higher and kathleen thinks i'm better , so it does n't matter my loved ones are telling me i'm better at a time when i can handle the endorsement without feeling like a failure for not saving them all from pain happy labor day ! ce
