i'm an altruist , but for totally selfish reasons i do things for others because it benefits me i have a how to book coming out in a couple of days hack your depression , as well as a mental health memoir of two minds and in the first book , one of the techniques i advocate for promoting subjective well being which is a more useful term , i think , than happiness is performing random acts of kindness a substantial amount of evidence exists to show that altruism and subjective well being are correlated it 's not just a correlation , though according to a recent paper at plos one , evidence even suggests a causality mechanism after a number of studies showed that people who performed random acts of kindness for a period of time were happier than those in the control group i cite additional research as if any were needed in hack your depression i think it 's fairly obvious to anyone who 's tried it that performing wanton , senseless , nonsensical acts of kindness aoks does so much good , on so many levels , it almost does n't warrant further discussion i'm always looking for ways to sneak more random aoks into my daily life earlier today i had a thought i'm not doing enough for my twitter followers why not promote some of them right here in the blog ? so my thought is maybe once a week for starters i 'll put up a thank you list , in graphic form see below , of people who 've recently retweeted me for example , here are people who rt 'd me in the last hours or so the icons are live links please click them ! reach out to these fine folks follow them most will follow back why would n't you follow them ? these guys actually retweet ! i have n't quite gotten a plan together for how to harvest retweeters reliably mind you , i'm not using the twitter api i'm just scraping the native twitter browser app with javascript to collect the links and icons that has its down side in terms of not being exhaustive , because the twitter app only tells you who the first retweeters were it 'll say joe b and others retweeted you , or whatever , above a row of icons those are the icons i'm collecting also , if i'm going to publish an icon hall of fame once a week , i 'll need to run the collection script at least once a day , every day it takes only a few seconds i do need to hook the script to a toolbar button , though i 'll figure it out do n't worry it 's not rocket surgery in the meantime if you want to appear in the weekly thank you list right here on this blog , just retweet something of mine kasthomas on twitter then check back here throughout the week if people find this useful , i 'll roll it out on author zone com my other site as well as hackyourdepression com my other other site , and also i 'll share the code here in case anybody else wants to try this senseless , wanton , random , nonsensical wantonness please visit hackyourdepression com to follow the progress of my books and tell a friend ! thank so much
