the spirit is more or less willing , but the body is weak last night , i wimped out five hours of sleep does not even count as sacrifice in today 's hour society but tonight , i refuse to sleep until i e mail the completed chapter to my thesis advisor ! the only kink in the plan is that i have to go to traffic safety school tomorrow at am fie on you , photo radar ! now , i'm prepared to go to the stupid class on no sleep a gangky , unshowered look will probably help me fit in , but it does give me a solid a m deadline will i make it ? heck if i know tune in tomorrow for the exciting conclusion of chapter thesis deadline ! ps this painting is the perfect visual representation of how all nighters feel and i'm a horrible person because i forgot the artist , though i'm pretty sure it 's van gogh anybody know ?
