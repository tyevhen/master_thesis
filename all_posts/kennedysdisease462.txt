from one father to all of you father s out there i wish you happy father s day one of the greatest joys in my life are my children i just hung up from a hour conversation with my daughter in minnesota we laughed and occasionally cried tears of joy the previous day i heard from my son who also lives in minnesota even though we could not be together today , knowing that i am in their thoughts and prayers and being able to share our memories makes this day extra special i am truly blessed
