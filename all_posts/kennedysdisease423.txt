a subject that comes up occasionally with those of us with kennedy s disease is anger i don t know how many times someone asks if anyone else with kennedy s disease is having problems with anger and or depression the term easily angered is often used the equation i v a i irritable cranky , easily irritated or annoyed abnormally sensitive to a stimulus v volatile liable to change rapidly and unpredictably , esp for the worse a anger a strong feeling of annoyance , displeasure , or hostility if a person is already irritated or frustrated and something unpredictable happens explosive anger could be the result personally , i know that i am more easily irritated these days i am not certain it is a side effect of having kennedy s disease , but i do know that often it is the result of my inability to perform normal daily tasks or the accumulation of several frustrations during a day then , when i realize i overreacted , i become frustrated again because i shouldn t have let it get to me the way it did perhaps we are dealing with another part of the acceptance process or as i call it learning to live with kennedy s disease whatever it is , it is not acceptable behavior chemical help i know that some people are using prescriptions drugs to help control the volatility personally , i do not like taking any drugs , other than over the counter , to help control something because of the potential side effects and the possibility of addiction that might change some day if my blood pressure increases , for example if these prescribed drugs help someone , however , without doing any harm then more power to them questions for today how about you ? have you noticed a change in your tolerance ? are you more easily angered today ? what do you believe is behind this change ? what have you found that helps with this issue ? i look forward to hearing from you
