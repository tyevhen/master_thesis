the other day , i wrote a damning critique of darwin 's theory and offered nothing in the way of a positive alternative to the traditional view of accumulated point mutations as a driving force for evolution it 's easy to take potshots at someone else 's theory and walk away as a rule , i do n't like naysayers who criticize something , then offer nothing in return so i 'd like to take a moment to try to offer a different perspective on evolution in particular , i 'd like to offer my own theory as to how new genes arise the question of where new genes comes from is , of course , one of the foremost open problems in biology current theory revolves mostly around gene duplication followed by modification of the duplicated gene via mutations and deletions under survival pressure reference below gene fusion and fission have also been proposed as mechanisms for gene origination in addition , genes derived from noncoding dna have recently been described in drosophila likewise , transposons genes that jump from one location to another have been implicated in gene biogensis the problem with these theories is that various enzymes are required in order for duplication , transposition , fusion , fission , etc , to occur to say nothing of transcription , translation initiation , translation elongation , and so on , and existing theories do n't explain how these participating enzymes appeared , themselves , in the first place a fully general theory has to start from the assumption that in pre cellular , pre chromosomal , pre organismic times , genes if they existed may have occurred singly , with multiple copies arising through non enzymatic replication likewise , we should assume that early protein making machinery was probably non enzymatic , which is to say entirely rna based i e , ribozymal if the idea of catalytic rna is new to you or sounds unreasonably farfetched , please review the nobel prize research by altman and cech the fundamental mechanisms of de novo gene creation available in pre enzymatic times might well have been nothing more than ribozymal duplication of nucleic acid sequences followed by erroneous translation erroneous translation can be of two fundamental types frameshifted translation , and reverse translation reverse translation here means transcription of the antisense strand of dna and subsequent translation to a polypeptide dna is parsed bases at a time the base combinations are called codons each codon corresponds to an amino acid if a single base is spuriously added to , or deleted from , a gene , the reading frame is disrupted and a hugely different amino acid sequence results this is called a frameshift error or frameshift mutation spurious addition or deletion of a single base to a free floating piece of single stranded genetic material rna or dna is all that 's needed in order to cause frameshifted translation the protein that results from a frameshift error is , of course , in general , vastly different from the original protein if pre organismic nucleic acids were single stranded , then reverse translation would require ' to ' reading of the nucleic acid as well as ' to ' reading if , on the other hand , early nucleic acids were double stranded , then ' to ' normal direction translation of each strand would suffice to give one normal and one reverse translation product note for non biologists in all known current organisms , reading of dna and rna takes place in the ' to ' direction only nucleic acids rna and dna have directionality , defined by the orientation of sugar backbone molecules in terms of their ' and ' carbons it 's interesting to speculate on the role of reverse translation in production of novel proteins , especially as it applies to early biological systems we do n't know if early systems relied on triplet codons or even if all four bases guanine , cytosine , adenine , thymine existed from the beginning we also do n't know if there were amino acids in the beginning there may have been fewer or more a novel possibility is that early triplet codons were palindromic giving identical semantics when read in either direction there are palindromic codons in the codon lexicon aga , gag , cac , aca , ata , tat , aaa , and so on which today encode amino acids out of the commonly used in a palindromic codon world , the distinction between sense and antisense nucleic acid sequences vanishes , because a single stranded gene made up of palindromic codons could be translated in either direction to give a polypeptide with the same sequence , the only chirality arising from n to c terminal polarity for example , the sequence ggg cac gcg aaa would give a polypeptide of glycine histidine alanine lysine whether translated forward or backward , the only difference being that the forward version would have glycine at the n terminus whereas the reverse version would have glycine at the c terminus the secondary and tertiary structures of the two versions would be the same as long as catalytic function did n't directly depend on an amino or carboxy terminus of an end acid , the two proteins would also be functionally indistinguishable codon palindromicity is potentially important in any system in which single stranded genes are bidirectionally translated , because in the case where a gene does happen to rely heavily on palindromic codons , the reverse translated product will for the reasons just explained have the potential to be functionally paralogous to the forward translated product to an extent matching the extent of palindromic codon usage but this assumes that in early organisms or pre organismic soups , single stranded genes could be translated in the ' to ' direction or the ' to ' direction it turns out modern organisms differ markedly in the degree to which they use palindromic codons , and there are remarkably some prokaryotes whose genes use an average of palindromic codons the complementary strand of dna would , of course , contain palindromic complements aga opposite tct , ccc opposite ggg , etc all of this makes for interesting conjecture , but does any of it really apply to the natural world ? for example do organisms actually employ strategies of erroneous translation in creating new proteins ? did today 's microbial meta proteome arise through mechanisms involving frameshifted and or reverse translation ? is there any evidence of such processes , one way or the other ? tomorrow i want to continue on this theme , presenting a little data to back up some of these strange ideas please join me and bring a biologist friend with you ! references begun , d , et al evidence for de novo evolution of testis expressed genes in the drosophila yakuba
