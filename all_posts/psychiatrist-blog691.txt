vs we bought our daughter a kindle for her birthday and i'm using it while she finishes her hard copy books so far , it has two books on it shrink rap because my husband bought it for his ipad and it magically appeared on the kindle , perhaps because they are all linked to my amazon account and slaughterhouse her summer reading so , billy pilgrim , kilgore trout , roland weary and a bunch of tralfamadorians are taking a walk down memory lane it 's light , it 's easy , it 's portable , and i'm addicted to screens i 'd kind of like to turn the pages with a touch screen , and how do i get the print a little larger for when the lighting is low oy , i 've hit that age ? so , kindle versus nook if you 're done the comparison , do let me know
