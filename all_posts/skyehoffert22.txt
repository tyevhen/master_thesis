okay i'm not sure how to review this movie , but i can tell you one thing i absolutely loved it ! keep in mind as you read my thoughts that i love action movies , zombie movies , thrillers basically blood and guts do n't faze me i grew up with two older brothers , in my mother 's eyes they ruined me , but i think they saved me from being a sentimental fool i have a funny story about my first encounter with pride and prejudice and my first reaction to it i think i was twelve when i watched the movie version with my mom i was bored out of my mind , and the only thing that amused me was quoting pirates of the caribbean because kiera knightly was in it i abhorred anything even remotely romantic , from a very young age when my mom asked me if i liked it , i said that if it had some action or a tragic death i might like it cue nine years later my requests were answered i sadly have n't read the book , but i'm going to snatch it up at the next time i see it i had planned to see this movie with two of my cousins or my dad we share almost exactly the same taste in movies and t v i was pleasantly surprised when my mom decided to take me , and slightly worried i guess i should give you a brief history of my mom and i from age seven we have been at odds , she wanted me in dresses with frills and i decided pants were much more my thing it only got worse as i got older and preferred murder mysteries , car chases , explosions , fight scenes to the sappy , kissing filled shows all my friends loved i loved video games of all kinds , but first person shooter games quickly became the favorite , but my mom did n't like me to play them because they were violent we learned to accept each others differences , but we still fight over them lovingly of course so when she said she would take me so we could spend some much needed time with each other before she flies of to africa , i said 'sure' , but kept thinking of the huge lecture that would follow the movie for most of the day after that i tried relentlessly to talk her out of it you know it 's about zombies , right ? it will probably be very gory zombies , blood and guts there might be a beheading or language you screamed watching mockingjay part , this will be far worse did i mention zombies ! she did n't take the bait and said even though she probably would close her eyes through most of it , she was going to see it for me i admired her stubbornness and gave up trying to convince her and we went after loading up on popcorn and pop , we found our respective screen my mom tsked at the zombie on the screen displaying our movie , and i groaned inwardly about what a terrible idea this was she and my cousin exchanged scared smiles as we took our seats the first preview was unfortunately some horror movie of the demon possessed variety , and while i read my popcorn bag my cousin and my mom hide behind their fingers and took fearful peaks , then discussed loudly how bad it was i was slightly amused , but hoped that the preview had nothing in common with the movie i knew they were nervous from the very start , which starts with a cartoony puppet way of explaining how the zombies came to be because my cousin had my arm in a vice like grip , and as soon as it started my mom asked me to ask my cousin about what she thought of the new movie theater i for one was excited my mom was happy to find that there was a story apart from the zombies , hence the name whoever thought of combining the two was really clever i wish i had thought of it there is something funny and inspiring about having th century edict mixed with zombie slaying seeing girls in prim and proper dresses , be fluent in the art of war that in between the dancing , parties , and victorian manners , there is blood and corpses lily james made a fantastic lizzie , and after a brief scene both my mom and cousin were like , there you are , skye i wish , the only common trait we share is , we both have no desire to marry , and the brown hair despite the fact of this film being peppered with zombies , it was n't as gory as i anticipated you see as much as zombies and action movie type violence does n't bother me i'm not really a fan of gore , excessive blood and flying limbs are n't my thing i think the film makers were n't trying to make this movie excessively bloody or scary , which i appreciate that 's not to say there is n't any , blood splatters the camera quite regularly , but i like how even thought someone is slashing someone 's head the quick cuts and camera angles shy away from the actual act the zombies themselves were quite creepy at one point there was a zombie mother and baby to which my mom responded that 's not holy ! it 's was such a funny thing to say , so me and my cousin burst out laughing we ended up doing a lot of that , as there was a lot of humor , and sassy dialogue most of the comic relief came from mr collins played by the wonderful matt smith he was my favorite , my cousin 's response to him was who is the weird looking person ! i was like , that is the 'th doctor , peasant ! well not really , but i did defend him to which my mom was like , please tell me he is not the one you like to which i was all like yes , but not like that that 's the problem with people who do n't watch doctor who , they will never understand my love for the doctor all of the character 's were fantastic actually , and as far as i remember kept true to the original they had all the great parts of mr darcy 's and lizzie 's unromance , i quite liked them which begs the question is there anyone more awkward then mr darcy ? to sum it up i loved it , my cousin loved it , and my mom would have liked it if it were n't for the zombies so basically she should just stick to pride and prejudice she was a good sport about it regardless i think i might read the original book now so if anything this show might have turned me into a jane austen fan you never know final thoughts it was bloody lovely !
