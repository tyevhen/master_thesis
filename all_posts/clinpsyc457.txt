the guardian has a neat story today about people with schizophrenia and depression who appear to benefit from playing soccer football an italian psychiatrist is obtaining startling results with patients suffering from schizophrenia and depression by enlisting them in a competitive football team mauro raffaeli trains his players , many of whom cannot work and are on psychiatric medication , twice a week on a pitch on the outskirts of rome of the who have passed through the ranks since the team formed in , over half have cut down their drug intake , but more importantly , more than half have returned to work drugs you can often never get rid of , but reintegrating into society is as important , he said obviously , this is not tightly controlled research but it does back my intuitive sense and observations as well as some research the research is only relevant to people with depression indicating that physical activity is good for one s mental health in this case , i think the combination of physical activity with teamwork helps to provide a sense of meaning hey , i m part of a team ! people are counting on me et cetera i m all for more creative interventions for schizophrenia and or depression the drugs and psychotherapy that are currently provided are unfortunately not getting the job done , so it s nice to see someone trying something unconventional that is likely to not result in many adverse effects check it out at the guardian
