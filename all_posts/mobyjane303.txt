curtiss phases of depression and the exercises i use to escape them biochemical phase a fearful stress , caused by anxious or negative thinking of which i may or may not be aware that has triggered the fight or flight response and dumped a pot load of stress chemicals into my brain exercise is good for this phase and sometimes with physical exertion i can actually stave off phase b i often use singing songs , counting , , , , , and nursery rhymes if the stress is high and does n't disappear with physical activity bioelectrical phase b this is the futile , i m not good enough , hopeless phase which seems to be a neural syndrome activated by a sufficient amount of stress chemicals this is the most painful phase of depression and can get worse and worse up to catatonia if you don t take action this phase is easy to succumb to the exercises i use for both phase a and b are singing songs , counting , , , , , nursery rhymes to distract myself long enough for the symptoms to subside and then i take up the duties of the day muted depression phase c this seems to be a kind of series of aftershocks from a real bad phase b where low grade stress and feelings of unworthiness and discontent still lingers and re triggers low grade feeling s of discontent and disconnect with the world for phase c counting and singing and nursery rhymes don t seem to work for this phase i need some kind of reconnection to nature , or my fellow man , so that i can somehow reaffirm myself as an okay person who has meaning and worth to others so that , thus reaffirmed , i can accept myself as a worthy part of the world and can see the world through love rather than fear this phase is not quite as compelling as phase b but it is still difficult to sustain the awareness that my discontent and disconnectedness comes totally from my own thinking rather than the circumstances and situations i find myself in , or the conditions and circumstances of some past history it is also difficult to keep remembering and taking action based on the truth that i am totally self responsible to get to a better place where i can be a more loving person sometimes in this phase i think about ancient wisdom quotes such as do the duty which is nearest to thee , thy second duty will already have become clearer
