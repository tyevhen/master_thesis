i just went to add someone to my facebook list it 's someone i 've spoken to once on a professional topic , but hey , it was a nice conversation , and information about this person came through my facebook newsfeed , and if i can have all these friends from my past lives , why not ? this time , however , i got an interesting message from facebook the button did n't just say send friend request it asked are you sure you know zelda ? not her real name and then , there was a whole disclaimer , which i found to be a bit threatening if you send a request to a stranger , it will be considered spam and your friend request will be blocked temporarily please only send this request if you know zelda i was about to press the button but i thought , do i know zelda ? how well do i have to know someone to qualify ? i 've never actually met zelda oh , actually i did pass her on the street in new orleans during apa , but i was in a rush so i did n't stop and introduce myself and say zelda , it 's me , dinah , can i know you now ? i decided that one phone conversation was enough , and that i know zelda maybe she 'll agree , but if she does n't that 's fine i just hate being threatened with a spam designation i'm many things , but spam i'm not
