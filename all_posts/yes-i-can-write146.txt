sometimes , actually quite often , the description of unschooling found in homeschooling books and on homeschooling websites is really , really not accurate and more even than simply inaccurate , i often find it rather insulting this is not a relationship built on dishonesty because what 's often insinuated , sometimes directly said , is that what unschooling really is , is not just letting kids do what they want , but instead parents sneakily teaching their children what they , the parents , want them to know this is often written with a slightly conspiratorial and condescending air is n't it wonderful how we let these children think they 're allowed to follow their own interests , while really we 're just pulling the strings ? now , if actually put into practice , this would completely fall apart kids know when they 're being manipulated , and will often let their displeasure in this fact be known i know that when younger , and faced with less respectful adults , my sister and i were definitely not impressed ! if they do n't have any interest in something their parents think they should learn , and the parents force it anyway , it ceases to be unschooling and if a parent shares an interest , asks if their kids want to go to a museum or sign up for a class , that 's not in the least sneaky or manipulative , so does n't warrant any conspiratorial aura all that is , is a parent openly asking their child if they 'd be interested in doing something , or genuinely sharing a personal interest to think that all unschooling is , is teaching a child without the child ever realizing they 're being taught is to completely misunderstand what unschooling is and how it works well , i'm here to say that unschooling has nothing to do with the covert manipulation of children an unschooling parent will fill their house with interesting things or make available other resource rich places libraries , cultural centers , co ops , etc they 'll be happy to help their children pursue a passion or simply get an answer to a question unschooling is a genuine respect for children , their right to choose their own learning , and their right to be supported in those choices now if only people who have no actual experience or understanding of unschooling would stop pretending they do , it would make it much easier for people just discovering it to gain a solid understanding of what unschooling really is you might also like homeschooling does n't mean your kids will be like you unschooling is not relaxed homeschooling unschooling is n't new really , it is n't when unschooling is n't perfect a call for more linkwithin
