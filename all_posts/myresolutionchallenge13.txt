february is the month of love , but here on motivate me ! we re looking at loving ourselves rather than joining the masses who are celebrating with their one and only if you do have a true love close to hand , then feel free to engage in the odd snuggle , a romantic meal , or a deep and meaningful discussion about your relationship communication , interaction , and respect are key elements to any successful partnership if , however , you want to join me on a journey of self discovery and take a deeper look at how we can love ourselves first , then stick with me last week i shared my top tips for working on self love , you can read that post here this week i wanted to discuss an area that might impact on our personal development , and hold up our well laid plans of loving ourselves unconditionally that issue is guilt not in an oh my god , i slept with my husband s brother ! way , although if you did do that , then you might want to skip off and sort that issue out ! the guilt i m talking about today includes all the mistakes or mundane nonsense we beat ourselves up about it could be that we weren t there when someone needed us , or you ve shouted at the kids over something trivial for me , i feel guilty about my overwhelming ironing pile i know , it sounds ridiculous doesn t it ! in truth it makes me feel like i m neglecting my family , failing as a mother and adds to my ever present i m not good enough limiting belief , i mean , seriously , who beats themselves up because of the ironing ? surprisingly , it s increasingly common for us to feel guilty about a host of mundane chores that don t get done , or not being available for our friends and family however , in today s society , we , as women , tend to be running a full time job , a home , and dealing with family and friends , as well as coping with a host of other tasks no wonder we feel so guilty if we can t manage it all the only thing this guilt does is crush our self esteem and , in turn , we begin to loathe the fact that we can t do it all we fall out of love with ourselves because we re not operating at one hundred per cent it drains our energy , and we end up being moody which , of course , we feel guilty about as a single mum , i sometimes snap at my kids when really it s because i m worried about something else and i don t have another adult to talk to i feel guilty about snapping , and if i don t apologise , then it escalates in my mind by recognising what i ve done , and saying i m sorry , i neutralise the guilt why , because it s normal guilt the usual kind that doesn t do that much harm if dealt with appropriately on the flip side , there is a form of guilt that is far from normal it s the unhealthy guilt that eats away at us the voice in your head that always ridicules you , and wants you to believe that you are a waste of time it s this guilt that we need to stop feeding knowing the difference between normal guilt where we can resolve the issue and put it right , and the unhealthy toxic guilt will help you to deal with it don t allow your inner critic to fuel the negativity of unhealthy guilt believe that you are doing everything you can in the best way you know how i find that writing in my journal every night helps me to differentiate between the two forms of guilt not going to the gym isn t the kind of guilt that will derail my personal development , but telling myself that i m a fat , useless , lazy creature who is unlovable because i didn t bother going to the gym is a warning sign that i ve let the unhealthy guilt take over my thoughts it can be one of the hardest things to do , learning to recognise what you are doing and disregarding it but , learning how to deal with guilt can clear the path for greater respect for yourself turning these thoughts around will silence the inner monologue of negativity , and you can concentrate your efforts on filling your head with positive affirmations , and self belief i am enough i m doing okay everything i do is done with the best intentions what i do is done to the best of my abilities grab yourself a journal if you haven t already got one , and begin recording your thoughts and actions start noticing what you re telling yourself observe your thoughts and start challenging your negativity and before long you ll be living a life full of self love what do you feel guilty about ? how do you cope with these feelings ? thanks for visiting my blog , i hope you enjoyed this post want more ? connect with me here twitter shelleywilson , instagram or check out my facebook pages http www facebook com fantasyauthorslwilson and http www facebook com motivatemeblog you can also find me on pinterest
