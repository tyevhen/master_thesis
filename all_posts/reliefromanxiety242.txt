the first panic attack i ever had was on gcse results day i was so nervous on the way to the venue where i would collect my results , i completely freaked out and could n't breathe and started crying i just assumed it was nerves and it passed as soon as i got into the venue as the months past , these panic attacks began to be a regular occurrence before driving lessons , before my hypnotherapy sessions , catching transport , going into a shop , applying for jobs , asking for something and eventually going to school i 've had so many panic attacks when going to school , it 's ridiculous even though i have experienced loads of panic attacks , there are a few that i can remember really clearly despite the panic attack on results day , another one i can clearly remember is when i went to apply for jobs applying for jobs is hard enough with anxiety , let alone someone who severely suffers from it it was going quite well in confidence terms i was in the mall and i went into several shops , but had little luck either they were n't taking on or i was too young i managed to hand in some and applied to others online i had been into so many shops and been rejected many anxiety sufferers will understand that this increases your anxiety i went into one shop that surprize , surprize was n't taking on and i stepped outside of the shop and started to panic i could n't breathe , then i was crying and slowly everything became a blur luckily i had support which could calm me down and helped me to breathe i remember clearly , i was planning to go to a rizzle kicks concert , but just like all of the other opportunities , i often did n't go through with them and just stayed at home i really did n't want to go the thought of all of those people and the thought that i could n't escape was overwhelming before i went out the door , i got into a panic i could n't breathe and was crying again this time i really could n't breathe at all , and it was so scary however , with the help of the support around me , i managed to calm down and actually enjoyed myself a final example i can think of is when i was about to catch a bus with my friend she was coming round to meet me , but the problem was that i had n't told her about my situation again , i had the usual symptoms could n't breathe , was crying and generally tried to get myself out of the situation i felt really ill however , as soon as my friend came round , i managed to control myself these panic attacks were getting out of hand and was making my anxiety worse therefore , it was decided that i was to see and hypnotherapist it 's not as scary as you think ! with time , my panic attacks slowly decreased and i learnt to understand the feelings which helped me to be in control i hope my experience of panic attacks can reassure you that you 're not alone and that what you 're feeling is only typical with help , panic attacks can be solved amy x
