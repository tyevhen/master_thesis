puck is home he seems to be in a lot of pain i'm exhausted , and i have yet to run today ! i 've already missed two days this week , and it 's getting desperately close to three if i do n't liven up pretty quick ! but i think puck 's being in pain makes me exhausted ! is that possible ? he 's got some pain meds , an anti inflammatory , and an antibiotic , but he 's had everything he can have today , and he still hurts i hate it ! he 's quite pathetic , actually , and i mean that in the most loving way possible ! i have to do passive range of motion and massage to his knee twice per day he 's not very fond of me touching his leg , but he trusts i wo n't hurt him and allows me to do it , which is nice this is definitely a time where i feel more of a two way bond with him he 's counting on me to keep him safe and comfortable when he 's well , he 'd go with pretty much anyone without looking back ! i did observe the surgery yesterday , and as soon as the vet clinic locates their camera 's cable , i will download pictures for all to see it was really interesting , and i was less anxious being in the room with him where i could see he was still breathing ! seeing surgery has also helped me already with his rehab since i know exactly where and how much was cut , poked , stretched , etc i have a much better feel for where to massage and how much pressure i can apply externally so i am very glad i decided to observe i think these first few weeks are going to be very long total recovery time is going to be weeks , most likely but my boy is a trooper i'm glad he 's home i know he 'll get through this the jury has yet to decide if i 'll make it or not
