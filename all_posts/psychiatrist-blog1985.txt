posted by dinah there is life beyond the blog there is life beyond the blog there is life beyond the blog last month , i wrote about how the blog was ruining my life it was distracting me from writing , diverting my angst and motivation and i found myself reading other people 's blogs , following fat doctor 's life as if it were my own a summer thing , i told myself , with the hope that with the end of summer i might enroll in a grad school course , might let shrink rap take its rightful place in my life as just a blog , not an obsession tonight , i had my first class a grad school course on fiction techniques it 's been a long time since i took a college course back then , we did n't register by fax we did n't email the professor before class began we did n't print out the parking map from a pdf file oh , i did n't have a car , never mind a computer and the professors never began class by commanding the students to turn off your cell phones other than that , it was pretty much the same i do n't think i was the oldest person in the class , but i might have been the second oldest there were a few people who looked a little older than the rest of the crew , and i'm not very good at guessing ages many of the students were in their twenties , and there were some very interesting hair chemicals involved i have homework i need to go buy my text books amazon is definately an improvement from those days of old and i have to write a to page paper where a fictional character discusses a difficult event in his her life my character is going to be a year old his difficult event is going to be slipping on the snowy steps and injuring his back a devestating injury resulting in chronic pain he becomes disabled , angry , depressed , and addicted to pain medications you may be asking why ? is n't that like going to work , rather than writing fiction ? maybe i 'll change my mind when i go to actually write it
