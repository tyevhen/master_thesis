i have this rolodex on my desk called the attitude builder there are cards containing positive affirmations and helpful statements i can change the saying every week , or as often as i want when i am working on something in my life , i will flip through the cards and bam ! there it is the answer i need last week , this card came up the most powerful force i have is what i say to myself and believe and , today , this card appeared i am controlled by what i accept and believe two powerful messages that i know , but don t always remember i cherry picked the following comments from the backs of these two cards my reality is what i accept and believe right or wrong , true or false that is not the determining factor i am what i think about i choose to believe only things that are loving and beneficial yes , there have been times in my life where my negativity created a crappy day it wasn t too long ago that two things went wrong that morning and my next comment was , what else could go wrong today ? when i came into my office and read the most powerful force i have is what i say to myself and believe , the light turned on i reflected on the previous two moments and chuckled those occurrences had nothing to do with the remainder of my day except in my imagination living with kennedy s disease is mind over matter if you don t mind , it doesn t matter life doesn t have to be as difficult as i make it sometimes my attitude and my self talk can create moments of chaos or moments of joy i ll choose joy anytime and , that is why these attitude builder cards are so powerful for me
