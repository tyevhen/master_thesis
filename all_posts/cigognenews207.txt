why does need hurt ? well , it does not until we feel it then it hurts a lot , which is why most of us act it out we show our needs every day and every minute , which is how we know they re there when we engage our therapist and show him how smart we are , how terribly insightful , we get a nodding approval our act out works and we don t have to feel our need , even though that need is liberating when felt when the narcissist cannot be the center of attention he starts to hurt until he can gain that center again indeed , all of us hurt when our needs are not fulfilled even though we have no awareness of that need and in fact , neurosis is designed to keep us unaware so we act out being helpless so we can get someone else to do it for us or to help us when there is no help we hurt but why the act out ? because it is a straight line from the need , except that the gates which diminish feeling access blunt the hurt and keep us unaware when we are unaware we do not hurt as much unconsciousness is our savior that straight line from need also works in reverse when we go back to it over time in therapy we start to hurt hold me , touch me , say i m good , hear me , talk to me all of the needs essential for normal survival to survive as a normal human being become alive again we hurt because those needs represent survival we need to be normal and need to grow normally when we can t the system says something is missing and provides pain to signal it pain keeps the need alive pain is essential to our survival and our normality i have treated film directors whose pathology rivals that of actors when they are not on scene they hurt yes they can even produce feeling scenes but it remains an act out not a felt feeling they don t really hurt enough to feel their need , but they hurt enough to feel depressed , alone and neglected even when those needs are not articulated in other words , needs become shrouded by the gating system whose function is to keep us unaware and unconscious all this is particularly true of the earliest imprints where pain is at the maximum it is the most powerful , the most driving , and the least accessible because it is least accessible , we usually ascribe our act outs to arcane reasons or we most often deny them we see it in the deep trenches of the psyche in sex which emanates from deep in the brain we go to therapy to solve our sex problem and we use the top level that has no access to deep levels where the imprints lie because the therapist nor the patient knows about those deep levels that are obliged to roam in a different terrain from where the problem lies so if the patient needs to be spanked to have orgasm , words won t touch i already wrote about a girl whose only touch from her father was when he lifted her skirt and spanked her bare bottom that touch fulfilled an unacknowledged need it felt good and become a sexual need or the need to see a partner s face when she orgasmed my patient never saw his mother smile or seem happy here he could see unalloyed joy it fulfilled a basic need for a normal , happy mother that is why i state that the act out is often a straight line from the need that need never dies we have two choices either we feel it or we act it out into infinity so when we believe we are normal and are bereft of any deep need , look at the act outs they are often subtle and they are also compulsive we do it over and over again leaving dirty dishes in the sink ? the need , don t make me do all the chores all of the time forced not to ask for help ? i want to be good and not be a bother this to parents who really don t want to be bothered the child fulfilled their needs in order to be loved , which never happened or the compulsive gambler who cannot stop he wants lady luck to help him and make him rich without him having to struggle for it basic need , then , becomes symbolic need that is the essence of neurosis we act on symbols the love of an audience instead of the need for it from parents i will be anything you want me to be if you can love me so here is the dilemma we need to feel need to overcome neurosis , and we need to act it out because we cannot feel it solution ? a slow trip to the depths , to the antipodes of the brain where all those needs await us take one more step and you are there but alas , the last step is filled with primal demons which keeps diverting us that is why we need help in therapy to help us bypass the demons for the moment and to step gingerly into the primal pool of pain aah , the pool is a lot warmer than i expected and not nearly so dangerous after all , it is only me who i will find how dangerous could that be ?
