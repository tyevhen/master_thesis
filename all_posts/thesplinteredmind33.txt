i recently posted a new article about procrastination over at my family guy blog it was originally intended to be about keeping promises , but became about finishing projects i have this project , you see a glorious , unfinished project that i ve been dying on for some time it s a rundown , formerly gorgeous dollhouse , and if i m not careful , my daughter will have daughters before i get around to refinishing it ! three years have passed now since i said i d finish it by christmas , so i ve decided to do something about it projects are easy to procrastinate when they are out of your sight that s one reason why the garage never gets cleared out , the taxes in a box under the recyclables you keep meaning to deliver never get filed , and any other number of glorious , unfinished projects that you ve been meaning to get around to are still waiting for you to get around to them i m pretty good about tackling projects , but this one escaped my focus because it was in the garage each time i ran into the garage for an errand or something , i d see the dollhouse and think , oh yeah ! i gotta do that ! but not now ! ! ! then i d forget about it until i went in there again in overcome procrastination why adhd adults do it , how cognitive behavioral therapy can change it , i cover the steps i usually take to break the long chain of procrastinated days i hope you find them useful i may cover the steps i took to complete the project and post about it here or i may forget again christmas is eleven months away anyway , right ? you might also like additude magazine sprinkle a li'l adhd on those waffles suicide no one cares ? it depends on who you listen to additude magazine who needs sleep anyway ? adhd adults need a little self control linkwithin
