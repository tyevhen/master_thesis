this is going to be one crazy week for our household we already had quite a bit going on john has to work late nights , and we are attending the last portion of the seed study for nate on wednesday up at hopkins it goes from to and will involve assessments of nate , blood and hair samples from nate , john , and me , and questions for me and john as well nate will also have an extra tube drawn for the study where they will mix his blood with mercury and look for an immune reaction so that 's already a long week next monday , i am going on a field trip with jack 's class to a park , with water , and canoes , and and year olds i do not have the time off from work available to do this but i was asked by the teachers to go and look out for jack , so that is what i'm doing then the phone rang this past friday morning it was really good news however it was also very overwhelming news as well about weeks ago , an acquaintance made me aware of a nationwide study being conducted on school aged children with asperger 's and autism it is an investigation of the use of a medication called namenda in kids with these conditions and tracks improvement in focus , social skills and over all behavior this drug was initially labeled for use in alzheimer 's patients , so it is already approved for safety , this is just a new use it has been being studied at locations nationwide the idea of using this medication in jack is exciting because of how ineffective the traditional approaches were for him they caused major sensory issues which became intolerable i was thrilled to hear about this opportunity , and the only negative i could see at the time was that jack needed to be no problem , that was coming in a month right ? not so fast the study was closing on april th days before his th birthday seriously ? i had already spoken with the boys' autism specialist about this issue and he was willing to try jack on the medicine off study , but of course i would much rather he be closely monitored if possible the phone call last friday was to inform me that the study had been extended by week so jack is in ! while this is wonderful , it is also a rush to get him through the evaluation process by the deadline to start the medication which is the end of the month this requires no less than appointments at children 's national medical center in d c first one was today and it was for me only to sign consents jack and i will go thursday for his evaluations , then on the st i will go for a parental interview , and then if all goes well , he will start the medication on the th it is a long commitment , possibly a year and a half and we will have to go down to d c at least once a month but if it helps him , it will be worth it in case you 're keeping track that 's a total of days away from work for kid stuff in one week john asked about summer vacation planning today and i had to laugh this is where my vacation time is going john would be willing to split the study trips , but we ca n't because a bunch of questionnaires have to be filled out with each visit and the investigator needs the respondent to be one consistent caregiver understandable , but well , blah keep your fingers crossed for mr jack
