i'm so encouraged by how well i feel today my back problem seems completely healed even if the anxiety comes back now and then i think that i'm in good shape to handle any setback but i did get a taste of how difficult it is to do brainswitching when you are really anxious as with anything else , our intention that we can be well and healthy puts us on the road to recovery thanks again for all your cards and letters of encouragement we are a resource for each other a b curtiss
