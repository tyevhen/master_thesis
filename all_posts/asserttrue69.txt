i do n't believe for a minute that the people of germany dislike the people of greece , nor vice versa does anybody really believe that ? so before anybody starts saying things like germany believes xyz or greeks say abc , we should stop and remember that the current crisis is really , first foremost , a crisis of leadership it 's the leaders of these countries who got the countries into their respective binds it 's worse than that , though it 's not just the political leaders it 's the bankers and imf and eurozone functionaries , many of whom were not elected and have no political legitimacy whatsoever one of the enduring tragedies of the human condition is that elected and unelected leaders so often end up pursuing policies that result in misery and death , on a massive scale , for millions of citizens who did n't vote for war , did n't vote for genocide , did n't vote for privation , starvation , dislocation , etc , yet got it anyway , because of bad leadership so when i say germany is involved , today , right now , in an extensive , slow motion , seemingly bloodless but actually quite violent project of economic genocide involving the greek people , one thing i do n't mean to suggest is that the citizens of germany , today , advocate starving anyone to death , depriving anyone of medicines , inducing suicides , dislocating families , stirring civil unrest , usurping democratic rule , etc that 's obviously not the case even so , let there be no mistake we are witnessing the continuation of world war ii , a post modern post war war , conducted by economic means , by german technocrats intent on subjugating a sovereign people it 's a campaign of coercion , using as varoufakis said banks , not tanks it all goes back to the jewish problem , but it 's not a simplistic matter of stereotypical hitleresque judenhass it 's more nuanced slovenian philosopher slavoj i ek , in interlude of living in the end times , explains the protean nature of judenhass jew hatred as follows jews are stigmatized as both upper class rich merchants and as lower class filthy , as overly intellectual and as too earthly sexual predators , as lazy and as workaholics sometimes they stand for a stubborn attachment to a particular lifestyle which prevents them from becoming full citizens of the state they live in , at other times for a homeless and uprooted universal cosmopolitanism indifferent towards all particular ethnic forms the focus changes with different historical epochs in the era of the french revolution , the jews were condemned as being overly particularistic they continued to hold onto their identity , rejecting the possibility of becoming abstract citizens like everyone else in the late nineteenth century , with the rise of imperialist patriotism , this accusation was turned around the jews were now considered all too cosmopolitan , lacking all roots so depending on what you want to hate no matter what it is , it 's possible to hate the jews for it hence , it 's obvious that the jew is really beyond anything else a proxy for the generic other this goes to what i ek means when he says anti semitism is not just one among ideologies it is ideology as such , ' par excellence the prototype of the shiftless , scheming , itinerant , undisciplined , untrustworthy constitutive other is now , of course , the greek the greek is the new jew german finance minister wolfgang sch uble has made countless statements about greek leadership 's mendacity , irresponsibility , lack of trustworthiness , lack of discipline , the greeks' unwillingness to stop living beyond their means , etc the insults reached a point , last march , where the greek ambassador in berlin felt the need to present a formal d marche to the german foreign ministry , alleging that herr sch uble made derogatory personal comments against greek finance minister yanis varoufakis in a meeting for which no minutes exist an unapologetic sch uble dismissed the accusations as nonsense but it 's not just sch uble bild articles on greece are full of derogatory slurs such as bankrupt greeks , greek profiteers , and extremos of greece the german press has built an extensive mythology around greek shiftlessness and entitlement , going back years , if not decades bernard henri l vy presciently foresaw that the new anti semitism would wear a progressive face , but one wonders if he saw beyond it , to a post ideological anti semitism that transcends the merely semitic ? what could be more progressive , more evocative of the erasure of history , than the ideal of a modern european union ? and what could be more dangerous to such a generic , history unencumbered union than an ancient culture , deeply committed at the level of its very identity , to the traditions of independence and democracy ? it 's not necessary to accept jean claude milner 's view of europe as having conveniently exported its bad luck the jews to a separate nation israel , post wwii , in order for one to appreciate eu 's newfound eagerness , under german and dutch leadership , to ring fence its new bad luck the greeks the new jews in an island based slave labor camp greece , kept in check by perpetual austerity amounting to economic , if not also actual , starvation herr sch uble 's advice to greece , from the start , loosely translated , has always been arbeit macht frei stop living beyond yours means work sacrifice pay redeem yourself or else we crush you we see a familiar , disturbing template here but there is nothing uniquely german about the worldwide trend toward mittellosenhass hatred of the poor that finds expression in the criminally insane austerity programs of a kleptocratic elite that now controls the world 's parliaments , congresses , election processes , laws , courts , trade agreements , and treaties arbeit macht frei is , in fact , also the subtext of such absurdities as the recent legislation prohibiting food stamp recipients from buying shellfish , the cap on atm withdrawals for welfare recipients in kansas , charging court costs to defendents for petty crimes , and countless other punish the poor schemes that seem to multiply by the day , in the u s , making greeks neo jews untouchables of all of us the objective of greek debt negotiations vis vis the ecb was never to find a path to sustainability , a route to greek financial independence it was always , in fact , the exact opposite it was and remains the eurogroup 's goal to obstruct and prevent debt sustainability , so as to scapegoat , subjugate , and ultimately destroy the irredeemably unclean other whose continued profligate ways threaten a unification project that depends on compliance , conformity , abandonment of history , and above all fiscal discipline that suitably strengthens and perpetuates the unified field of kapital capitalism 's constitutive other the indigent the uncompetitive those who cannot succeed on their own in a free market the greek must be contained , quarantined , and if possible , killed off , or at least discouraged from multiplying how often have we heard the language of disease used in discussions of greece contagion , infection , malaise that spreads , immunity , inoculation , etc ? how often did the nazis use similar terms in describing jewishness ? of course , the modern face of fascism is suitably technocratic and antiseptic , maintaining a pretense of non violence the waterboarding is virtualized now , the torture slow banks , not tanks , do the dirty work but any sociologist will tell you economic violence is , in the end , just as real as any other kind it results in premature death due to alcoholism , diabetes , suicide , malnutrition , crime , inadequate health care , etc the life expectancy of the poor is foreshortened in a thousand ways it constitutes its own special , pseudo sanitized form of eugenics this is why herr doktor sch uble 's shortsighted , not at all helpful non solution of year grexit must be defeated so we can end world war iia before it goes to revision iib we must somehow break into the twenty first century and forge a new path forward one that includes , and does not shove aside or exteriminate or subjugate , the less fortunate because at the end of the day , we are all now greeks addendum to my jewish friends who will object strongly , perhaps that there is no comparison between the gas chambers of dachau and mere economic privation , let me say how strongly i agree with you , and yet let me also say this as one who has thought deeply about the subject of suicide over the years , it is still not intuitively obvious to me that a sudden knife in the gut is fundamentally worse than years of slow death accompanied by degradation the non sociologically trained layman can be forgiven for thinking there 's a difference between the two , and there is , physically and temporally , a difference , of course , but the question is at what point is loss of dignity , combined with slow death , actually worse than quick murder ? the current program of austerity advocated by neoliberal ruling elite one percenters is an ersatz program of genocide , eugenics , and death it is the modern gas chamber on this , let future history be my judge have you checked out my free book mental health myths debunked ?
