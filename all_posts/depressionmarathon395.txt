i'm spending the weekend in madison , wisconsin , with d it should be fun we are running a half marathon together tomorrow morning and then spending the rest of the weekend bumming around madison as usual it will be nice to see d and spend time with him , and the race is known to be well organized and fun d 's son will be joining us this evening for dinner , and he 's also running the race tomorrow morning i'm looking forward to a nice weekend away i do n't know what kind of performance to expect , as i did n't really taper for this race i altered my schedule a bit i ran miles twice this week , but i did n't do any speed work , and i did skip one of my kettlebell classes i think i 'll just run by feel again and try to enjoy the event i 'd like to run fast , of course , but i 'll try not to freak out if i do n't my performance is not that important preparing for twin cities marathon is the long term goal this weekend is more about having fun with d overall , i'm still feeling pretty good i was physically whipped earlier this week , but i 've recovered from that i think skipping my wednesday night kettlebell class helped me recoup some needed energy my mood seems okay it could be better , but it 's not in the pits things have been busy but smooth the only drama i currently face is jet 's upcoming surgery i'm feeling quite ambivalent about putting him through it he 's not limping nearly as much as he was , and i'm not sure what to think about that he 's so joyous and spirited i hate to be responsible for bringing him pain i hate the thought of him having to be quiet and sedate for six weeks it 's going to be a real challenge , and i question whether it is worth it the problem is , i ca n't just put it off this surgery is only done on very young dogs it is not successful on older dogs , but younger dogs do benefit from it so it 's an either now or never decision , and i'm struggling with it i'm leaning toward doing it , but i'm going to discuss it more in depth with the vet today his surgery is currently scheduled for next tuesday , the th he 'll have just turned months old i'm going to leave you with a picture of my boy he 's sitting on my back deck with about of his collection of sticks and toys when i mow , i pick each of these up and place them on the deck jet thinks this is great fun ! as quickly as i can set them down , he races to put each one back in the yard does n't he look proud of himself ? have a great weekend , friends !
