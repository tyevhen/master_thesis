there 've been a number of what one might call peak google articles lately , most conspicuously the new york times piece yesterday not the first such article and not the last a few days ago , i blogged about the death of blogging and pointed out that blogspot is yet another google property slowly going down in flames , following in the zombie like footsteps of igoogle , google answers , google notebook , aardvark , buzz , and about other flops gtalk reportedly goes dead on monday meanwhile google hangouts which officially superseded gtalk in may never really took off , whereas whatsapp has million users google is getting pretty good at this fail fast stuff but what really matters is revenue the revenue picture does n't look so bad from this graph like microsoft , google will probably remain financially viable for a long time let 's not kid ourselves , but unlike microsoft , google makes most of its money from ads that could go away comparatively quickly advertisers are notoriously fickle users of search or gmail might feel locked in , but advertisers never do so do n't fixate on the above graph remember , that 's the rearview mirror it 's inevitable that google revenues will slip wall street will punish the stock analysts will blame google 's failed social strategy google will respond by making a bid for twitter the combined stock and cash deal will probably top billion , yet will be seen by some as cheap along the way , there will be layoffs google 's r d and g a spending are out of control twitter ca n't save google , though the problems ultimately go far beyond social strategy that 's a blog by itself they 're cultural it 's a culture of arrogance it wo n't be fixed overnight if indeed it 's fixable i want to take a moment to thank the following people for retweeting me in the past hours follow these kind folks on twitter click on their pictures they rock ! be sure to visit my new site hackyourdepression com thanks !
