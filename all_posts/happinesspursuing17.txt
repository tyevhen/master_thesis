although it is supposed to take anywhere from a few weeks to four months , i thought i 'd weigh in weekly so here 's the first installment i do n't discuss my depression much with my wife because it worries her quite a lot when she was in her early twenties a boyfriend killed himself and blamed her in his note she does n't talk about it much but i'm sure it comes to mind when i bring up my depression i hate reminding her of such a terrible time but , i felt i needed to warn her that i was trying a new supplement other things that i 've tried , most specifically st john 's wort , initially make all my emotions rawer it takes a week or two for me to stabilize i suppose this is because they address the mood directly whatever the reason , it 's not fun for me and even less fun , i'm sure , to be around me i'm not going to come home one day and find you hanging from the rafters , am i ? she asked i told her that 's what i'm trying to prevent anyway , the mood shock never came the up and down swings i was expecting never happened in fact , i really felt nothing then i noticed two things first , i'm waking up earlier being unable to get out of bed is one of the markers of depression and i 've become the king of staying in bed some days i do n't get out of bed until a , one of the dangerous side effects of working at home ! but , starting a couple of days after i started fa i 've been getting up between and , even when i do n't get that good of a night 's sleep another completely unexpected development has been an increased sex drive i 've never had a problem in this area but for the past week or so i 've really not had a problem with it odd so , that 's my folic acid update for week one a couple of other things have been going on melanie , the blogger who suggest fa to me , and i have been corresponding she 's an interesting person although i think if i knew her in person her enthusiasm would overwhelm me she blogged about me , focusing on my atheism as much as my depression or this blog her emails have come pretty close to witnessing which does n't really bother me , i just find it a little curious i 'd never really thought about it but i suppose that there might be a few people out there who would be similarly interested in my atheism and how it does or does not affect my depression i 've been turning a potential blog entry about that over in my head for a few days so look for that a couple of other people have also emailed one is a kid with depression who 's headed for college this fall he wants help and is willing to seek out a pro but , he 's reluctant to tell his mom , which kinda breaks my heart for both him and her this creates a big obstacle for him since he 's on her insurance i suggested that he look see if there 's a community counseling center nearby that might be willing to work with him on payments or he can check with the school nurse when he gets to college what a burden to take with you to college , that time when the world is supposed to be bright , shiny and full of possibilities i really hope he finds a way through if you want to check out his blog it 's here finally , another reader emailed she is working through depression like the rest of us with the added bonus of a dear friend who actually loved life recently having died he was healthy , in his early thirties and had a fantastic outlook on life i did n't know what to offer her except commiseration we 're a raggedy lot , are n't we ?
