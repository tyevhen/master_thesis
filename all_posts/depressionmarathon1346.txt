today , this illness is interrupting my life i guess i have not yet directly addressed this issue depression interrupting my life i 've alluded to it multiple times it is implied in several previous posts in fact , now that i think about it , i 've made it pretty damn obvious but today , depression is blatantly interrupting my life right now i am sitting in a very expensive , metropolitan hotel room next door to a very expensive , weekend training seminar which started three hours ago are you starting to see the problem ? this is depression this is depression screwing up my plans , cutting into my potential , and interrupting my life my illness does not care that i have spent this time and money in an effort to better my situation this illness mocks goal setting and planning while i endeavor to remove myself from disability , depression slips silently alongside me , barely holding back a sneer , as it endeavors to break my stride then as if on some predetermined cue , out it comes to block my way today , my depression is not so silent it is loud it is clear it is directly in my way today , depression is blatantly interrupting my life and i hate it but ! i hate it , but seven years of my sneaky depression 's dance have forced me to cope i have learned some sneakiness , too in years past , when depression jumped in my way , we fought i punched , cut , kicked , screamed , slapped , scratched , and poured chemicals down my throat depression loved this ! it highlighted its sneakiness ! it allowed me to feel i was winning , momentarily , only to hit me harder after i 'd knocked myself a notch further down in the end , i was bruised , battered , and suicidal while depression had gained free residency in my soul today , i will wait wait my depression is not so fond of this technique , but it works sometimes quickly , sometimes slowly unfortunately , i cannot control the timeline , but perhaps waiting bores my combative depression into pulling up stakes sooner rather than later the one thing i do know is by waiting i will not end up more bruised than i already am as hard as it is , i cannot afford to panic i cannot afford to think of the money and time i am wasting i cannot afford to feed my depression , as hard as that currently is so , here i am i am waiting in a very expensive , metropolitan hotel room next door to a very expensive , weekend training seminar that started three hours ago my depression has lept into my path today it is blocking my way and interrupting my life temporarily
