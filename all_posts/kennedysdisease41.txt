the dictionary defines discipline as the act of denying yourself controlling your impulses and , obsession is defined as a compulsive preoccupation with something there is a saying , use it or lose it ! it has been over eleven months since i started my new exercise program because of my discipline obsession ? , i have exercised every day but one christmas the reason i continue to exercise every day is because the exercise program works i am now using weights for all of the arm and shoulder exercises and increased weights for a couple exercises leg exercises have become so easy that i increased the number of reps and the actual hold time to a point where i become a little bored counting this is all good news and probably explains my obsession i mean discipline with exercise i can also say that my legs are stronger today than one year ago if the documentation is correct about those of us with kennedy 's disease , then , on average , we lose about two percent of our strength each year if that is the case , i reversed the downward trend at least for this year if that a year number were correct , that would mean that my strength should have declined by about it has been years since onset there are times that i feel that way , but as a whole , i do not take much credence in averages i guess the only sure way to know would be to have been tested every year using the same exercise program on the other hand , what does it matter ? no two people with the defect decline at the same rate perhaps it is important for the scientific community or for doctors to help explain the degradation if i would have thought years ago that i would be in this condition today , i would have been more worried as i mentioned in my two articles on exercising , i just enjoy exercising it is something that i have done most of my life it makes me feel good endorphins as well as breathe better and , i can see results so , whether it is a quality discipline or a compulsion obsession , what does it really matter as long as it feels good and does no harm ? next , you will be questioning why i go through a pack of handy wipes every day just kidding
