a few weeks ago , something happened on game of thrones even if you have n't seen it , you know somebody died since people who freely post game of thrones spoilers deserve to languish in the lower circles of hell normally reserved for those people who post facebook updates about their bowel movements and scream at innocent cashiers to feel alive , i'm giving you fair warning if you have n't seen game of thrones season , eipsode , there be spoilers ahead turn back now ! seriously last warning once you scroll down , you ca n't un see what you 're about to read , and when you do get around to watching the episode , you 'll ignore everything that happens to the interchangeable angry white men while you wait for the pivotal scene to arrive you do n't want that they 're laughing at you for not heeding my warnings okay , i warned you you ready for this ? joffrey baratheon is dead you 're not looking so good , buddy yes , after more than three seasons of demanding the little turd 's blood , fans of the show finally got their wish when joffrey choked to death on poisoned wine at his own wedding ding dong , the witch is dead but before you burst into song and break out the celebratory burning effigy , take a minute to over analyze the moment if you do , you might find that joffrey 's death is as much as a sad occasion as it is a happy one that 's because joffrey is just a child joffrey baratheon was a terrible king , an awful son , and an all around shitty human being he was also just thirteen years old when he died in other words , he was legally , physically and mentally still a child just like jon snow who is totally , guys thirteen year olds are naturally shitty it 's their default state it 's the only way they know how to be think about any thirteen year olds you know they make terrible decisions , say horrible things , and they 're capable of ball shriveling cruelty at the drop of their rhinestone studded hats do they really deserve to die painful deaths for that ? hell , think about yourself at thirteen would you trust thirteen year old you with your life ? your job ? your facebook account ? i could n't be trusted to pick out a non stupid hair colour at thirteen , never mind rule a kingdom i am so very , very glad that social media did n't exist until i was in high school when you 're an adolescent , the frontal lobes of your brain are essentially a big gooey mush of neurons and that 's bad news for everyone who comes in contact with you , because those parts of your brain that have n't come online yet are in charge of things like impulse control , empathy , emotional regulation , and decision making sure , on a cognitive level , adolescents know that things like theft and assault and genocide are wrong , but that 's a very different from understanding , on an emotional and empathetic level , that these things are wrong you all know that stealing is wrong , but i'm willing to guess that my entire readership is n't watching game of thrones on a bought and paid for hbo subscription or an hbo canada subscription , since almost half of you are canadian the same thing applies to joffrey yes , he 's a tyrant and a terror , and he brought his death on himself but he 's still a child he was n't even old enough to shave , let along recognize the moral gravity of his actions he 's a child who wound up in a situation he was n't capable of handling , asked to make decisions he could n't possibly understand , and because of it , he died scared in his mother 's arms , pleading for her to help him that hardly seems like something to celebrate thanks to forces outside joffrey 's control , he never got the chance to grow up and mature a little most people with serious emotional and behavioral disturbances in childhood tend to grow out of it as they age maybe joffrey eventually would have too but any chance at redemption has been taken from him , and the worst part is the person responsible this is all cersei 's fault , not his pretend , for just a moment , that you 're a middle aged woman living in a medieval , semi fantasy universe of course , you 're not just any middle aged woman you are the queen of a kingdom that effectively amounts to all of the temperate areas in your region you married your husband because power , obviously , and despite his laziness , whore mongering and spectacular obesity , he 's shaped up to be a moderately effective king since your husband is too busy sticking his sword both metal and otherwise into things all day , you and your super family of creepy blonde people have some say in what goes on , though not nearly as much as the king of the cold ass areas in your region also , despite your wealth and status , you own approximately one outfit this one and you 're none too pleased about it of course , no amount of money or influence can change the fact that , as a woman , your entire value as a human being hinges on your ability to fire babies out of your nether regions problem is , you hardly want to hop into bed with your husband and his literal crotchload of old timey stds so you look around , notice 'hot damn , my dna is attractive' and decide to find out what happens when you create a child who shares of your genes your repeated experiments in inbreeding have three results you get a gentle , mild mannered son a sweet , charming daughter and a dead eyed , crossbow wielding psychopath this might be a stretch for some of you cersei lannister is responsible for joffrey 's rise and fall in three ways first off , she created him yes , i know that the latex condom is probably a long , long way off in the future in her world , but that 's not what i'm talking about every human society to ever live on this earth has had some sort of incest taboo westeros is not ancient egypt , where sibling marriage was required of the nobility cersei 's little tryst with her brother 's hair and the rest of the man attached to it is such a dark secret , jaime was literally willing to straight up murder a child to keep it a secret even if they are living in the 'quick , fetch more leeches ! ' era of medical technology , cersei has plenty of reason to suspect that letting your twin father your children is just not a good idea you have endured four goddamn seasons of the 'bran stark ca n't walk' storyline because of jaime remember that still , jaime lannister is awfully pretty but even if we forgive cersei for taking sisterly love a little too far , she is still responsible for creating joffrey in the books and in the tv show , to some extent , we get a glimpse of the overarching theme of joffrey 's childhood in cersei 's eyes , he can do absolutely no wrong robert wants nothing more than to haul off and slap the smirk right off the kid 's face , but cersei wo n't hear of it no matter what depraved , dead animal related thing he gets up to , cersei does nothing but dote on him , actively shielding him from the consequences of his actions whenever necessary she creates a spoiled brat a brat with no regard for life , no empathy , and no ability whatsoever to consider how his actions will impact other people what 's more , cersei raised two other children who are seemingly polite and well adjusted in other words , she is apparently capable of being a decent parent , but she reserves all of her shitty child rearing for the only one of her offspring who is expected to rule over everything that is n't perma frost who the fuck decided that teaching him to use this was a good idea ? but hey , sometimes people just turn out badly , no matter how hard their parents try to raise them right maybe joffrey was broken from birth that 's hardly his fault , or his mother 's but you know what 's still cersei 's fault ? putting him on the throne she knew full well that her eldest child was a monster she knew that robert was not she also knew that her family had the resources to effectively cover up any ugly deed or rumor they pleased , including all of her dwarf brother 's illicit sexytimes and yet , she is so threatened by someone noticing that joffrey 's hair colour is awfully lannister ish that she wigs out and arranges for her husband to be murdered by an angry pig she lives roughly a thousand years before the onset of dna technology , and she chooses to put a raging , hormonal teenage lunatic on the throne rather than risk someone pointing out that her son has the same hair colour as his mother in book six , daenerys' armies and dragons abandon her when they realize she was a brunette the entire time it was a terrible decision , and it is literally cersei lannister 's fault she 's not living in a democracy , where the people can vote for a new heir if word gets out that jaime might be her babydaddy they 're royalty doubting what they say is goddamn treason cersei could claim that the moon itself plummeted down out of the sky to impregnate her , and people would be forced to believe her she has far less to fear from a rumor than she does from living under the thumb of her heartless son from her perspective , it hardly even makes sense as robert 's wife and queen , she gets to rule alongside him for the rest of his pudgy , hooker banging life as joffrey 's mother , she 'll be relegated to queen regent for maybe four or five years , and then she 'll lose power completely if she 'd just waited , joffrey still would have ended up as king after he had matured into an adult despite what crotchety old people with shotguns would have you believe , kids get less psychotic with age , not more did n't really think that one through , did ya ? if she was going to murder someone to keep her family 's claim to the throne safe , then all she needed to do was bump ned stark off the mortal coil since he 's the only person alive who decides that a family resemblance between nephew and uncle is suspicious , he is the only threat to the lannister 's position killing robert does n't help her it just catapults her son into power long before he 's actually prepared to be there and we can hardly blame joffrey for accepting the throne he was groomed for the role every moment of his childhood that was n't spent impaling puppies and kicking little girls was devoted to listening to other people tell him that he was born to be king of course he would agree to rule , after his mother offered him up the throne on a silver platter but once his extravagantly clothed behind hit the iron throne , cersei lannister became the least threatening member of her clan because tywin lannister is a psychopath joffrey baratheon was cruel in exactly the way you 'd expect a teenage boy to be cruel he grows bored of people quickly he bullies everyone around him to make himself feel powerful he has a fragile ego , and he lashes out at anyone who tarnishes it he 's rude to his mother , abusive to animals , savage towards women , and generally hateful to the world around him joffrey , enraged or constipated thankfully , he is also fairly predictable , in exactly the ways you 'd expect a teenage boy to be predictable he has a childish perspective on what it means to be king , and happily leaves most of the actual ruling to his family he always targets the people who are least able to defend themselves and he has no interest whatsoever in letting his mom or grandfather cramp his style joffrey only takes orders from boobs these boobs , to be exact naturally , this makes tommen baratheon , joffrey 's younger brother and the next heir to the throne , a preferable ruler despite his incest tastic origins , tommen is kind , gentle and sensitive he likes sweets , kittens and baby deer , and will almost definitely not behead anybody and display their head on a pike he also happens to be freaking years old , which means he will almost certainly take a whole lot of direct advice from his dear old grandpa which is bad very bad tywin lannister is the psychopath joffrey could only dream of being while the latter expressed himself mainly through ineffective , petulant temper tantrums , tywin is patient and calculating enough to get whatever he wants he is equally capable of orchestrating a war or a marriage to get his way he does n't trifle with bullying the weak he strikes the strongest when they least expect it he 's even willing to literally murder his own children in order to keep his family 's firm grip on power and he almost certainly does not take orders from boobs nope not even those boobs joffrey is a dangerous man to have in power because he 's short tempered and childish tywin is a far more dangerous leader , because he 's a goddamn psychopath , and he knows exactly what he 's doing joffrey killed a prostitute tywin killed the stark family in fact , the only real threat to tywin 's power was joffrey himself no matter how cunning , or experienced , or ruthless tywin may be , joffrey was still his king if joffrey ordered tywin to dance through the castle in his underwear , tywin would have to do it there 's no authority tywin can invoke that will override the king 's word the pair butt heads over everything tywin has to have drawn out arguments with his grandson and resort to petty measures , like failing to tell him about meetings , in order to get his way joffrey was , in a lot of ways , the lesser of the two evils , and as he got older , he would almost certainly have gotten more adept at thwarting his grandfather for instance , joffrey would almost certainly have put an end to his grandfather 's twerking but now joffrey is dead , and tommen is king sweet , innocent tommen , who so desperately wants to please the grandfather his admires tommen , who will almost certainly do as tywin says without question , leaving westeros in the hands of a vicious psychopath by proxy winter is coming , indeed what did you think of the purple wedding ?
