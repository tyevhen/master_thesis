why does a rut seem to feed on itself ? thereby making a rut into a big rut , and a bit rut into a huge rut , and a huge rut into the grand canyon ! ! ! if there is something wider and deeper than the grand canyon , i am afraid i just might discover it within the next couple days ! god , i hate this ! ! ruts suck ! the only thing hungrier than a rut is me when i am in a rut ! and of course , i scarf up crud and crap and chocolate when i am in a rut , which feeds my gut and the rut , which expands the gut and the rut , and i feel like crap i feel like crap when my house is a mess , and my dishes are n't done , and there are bills piled on my kitchen table , and the laundry i did last week is still hanging on the drying racks in my living room which was supposed to force me to put it away because i would n't want to walk around it the deepening rut led to the compounded mess , and the mess resulted from my inactivity i e rut these last days well , okay , i got into the pool yesterday , but other than that it 's been hot fudge and recliner all the way ! what 's up with that ? why does everything feel so damn hard ? i know it will pass i have been here before i am much better at waiting these things out than i used to be i just pray the mess does n't get too great , the physical shape too misshapen , and the hole too deep before the rut starts to fill itself in if only i could turn the rut into a mountain once in awhile hmmm that could be fun !
