i hate doing posts , before i have caught up on emails , blogs , and comments but i have had this one on my mind for awhile i was watching a youtube video by nerdwriter about casey niestat a talented video blogger it was talking about the art of editing and how when it 's done well you do n't even notice that it 's been done , it 's seamless this applies to far more than just youtube to me , it applies to the internet as a whole it 's something we all forget about , we take things at face value the perfectly edited and shot pictures on instagram , the cute planned and rewritten blog posts , that have been been made with the purpose of being seen i'm guilty of this myself , all the pictures i post on here are carefully selected and edited to be the best they can be yet for every good picture i take , there are at least fifty bad ones we have all gotten so good at hiding the rough parts from the world , editing our lives to be aesthetically pleasing most of what we see on a daily basis is a snapshot at best a heavily edited one at that , an almost artificial version it 's incredibly hard to be genuine online and off especially in a society that praises perfection as unattainable and manufactured as it is we buy it anyway , i know i do i rate myself by it , and think that if i just raise the bar a little higher i will make it the thing i am trying to reach does n't exist this self imposed perfection , is wasting my time and wreaking havoc on what was left of my self esteem there is beauty in our imperfections we need to start embracing them
