i'm supposed to be at work right now unfortunately , i spent much of the night awake with a sore throat , headache and body aches i do believe i am getting sick i hate being sick i especially hate being sick one week prior to my next marathon hmmm perhaps god really is trying to tell me something speaking of sick , my orthopedic doctor called in sick on friday therefore , i did not get to have my knee evaluated i'm pretty sure i have a torn meniscus in there , but i need him to confirm that and to get the ball rolling to recovery i e cut it out fortunately , i was able to reschedule the appointment for this wednesday , so i do n't have too long to wait to see him i'm going to see what he says about running vs not running the marathon next week my friend , kate , will be coming into town for the marathon this will be the fifth marathon we will be doing together in the last year and a half i'm looking forward to seeing her and showing off my home state i just wish i was in better shape myself oh well , whether i run or not , i know she will enjoy herself well , my head is pounding i guess it 's time to lie back down i 've gotta get my rest i 've got no time to waste !
