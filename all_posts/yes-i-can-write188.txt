i now have a monthly column at enjoy life unschooling called breaking pavement ! the first installment , entitled bare feet and learning connections , came out today today , as i walked with my sister and a friend , i was thinking a lot about this column what to write , what to write the sun was getting steadily lower , but there was still a fair bit of light , birds singing , and the scent of smoke in the air my shoes , even though i was only wearing flip flops , felt like they were trapping my feet , so i slipped them off and spent the rest of our long and meandering walk in bare feet ahh , the relief ! the joy ! smooth rough sharp hard soft prickly the world passes by underneath my feet when i finally came back inside , soles thoroughly blackened and sun mostly gone , i felt a bit of a letdown still no inspiration for what to write but then i started thinking about walking in bare feet thinking about how hardened my feet used to be , and how soft they are now that i ve been wearing shoes so often i miss walking in bare feet so i ve been determined to go barefoot more often ! i like it it feels good and i started thinking about why i like going barefoot what about this no shoes thing makes me so happy ? i realized that what it really is , the connection with shoes , i m putting yet one more barrier between me and the world around me without them , i feel more connected to the dirt grass gravel pavement mud connection is so important to continue reading , head on over here ! peace , idzie you might also like learning advice from a learning life learning by doing education made real what do unschoolers do ? breaking down hierarchies in learning re imagining the linkwithin
