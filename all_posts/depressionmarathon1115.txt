the nonsensical illness continues today i 've appreciated your comments on my last two posts i 've been feeling isolated and totally alone lately the noise in my brain seems so unique , in the worst possible way , that it really helped to hear some of you could relate i had no idea ! however , i'm also very sorry any of you can relate ! today , i face questions of reality it simply does n't make sense that i can go to work , or to a meeting , or to a party and outwardly function as a healthy , happy human yet , inside there is only death , negativity , fear and sadness it 's nonsense ! i feel like i'm leading a double life , and it makes me question the reality of this illness if i'm able to function so well despite the turmoil i feel , especially when alone , is it possible i do n't really have depression at all ? is this just some elaborate ruse of which i 've become convinced the people on the outside would n't recognize the etta i know only a very select few even get to see her mostly professionals and even they do n't get the full story it 's just too unbelievable how can i smile while saying i feel like shit ? how can i crack jokes when escape and death occupy my brain ? it does n't make any sense i am open and honest with people , yet i am always protecting , too i'm protecting myself , and i'm protecting them the disconnect between my shell and my core is so great , if i were truly honest , i'm afraid nobody could believe me well you do n't look like you feel like that you do n't act like you feel that bad if you truly felt like that , there 's no way you 'd be able to work or run or at the same time , i do n't want to add burden to those around me , even the pros it 's just too much i think i'm also ashamed of my sadness , lethargy , and hopelessness i still think i should be able to make myself well just do it ! i guess i tend to downplay the healthy actions i take while ruminating on the continually recurring negative symptoms that 's the problem , is n't it , the symptoms continually reoccur and for whatever reason , this time i do n't feel i have a lot left with which to fight
