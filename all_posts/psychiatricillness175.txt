i went to and helped organise a social anxiety meet for women on saturday i found the meeting really really difficult i knew most of the women i met and have spoken to them all on a one to one basis i can say i like each of them and got on well with them on their own i found it very un nerving how quickly the group gelled together and bonded through small talk i flashed back to memories of always beng excluded from groups at school i found it really difficult and it felt like i was being excluded and talked about i know it was not happening with these people as they all have sa and would never do anything like that to someone what really triggered the thoughts for me were taking about men and some of the men who go to the social anxiety meets only go to meet women i do not have a problem with this as my purpose to meets is similar although i really want to meet friends first i really do understand that some women would find the general meets intimidating if someone fancied them and they did not know how to handle it i took offense when they over generalised and said'men' a lot i personally get on far better with men than women as a general rule i find women bond by finding a common grudge whether that is about an individual or group of people where men tend to bond over sport or more general topics i blame a long history of delusional depression of thinking people hate me and are wispering about me all the time i went from age right up until last year with a paranoid view of life i believed that people always hated me , i was an outsider and the but of all jokes having felt like i have been on the receiving end of this for many years i am very sensitive if people critisie others this really upsets me i over generalise myself and take any form of critisim as hatred and implying thatsomeone is not as good as the people critising i find this very offensive i found the womens meet extremely difficult and i am debating whether to go to another to work on my fear of them or just stay away and avoid groups of women forever in a small group i am comfortable with steering conversations away from other people but as groups get larger it is more and more difficult i find men are not as likely to talk about others as women so maybe that is why i find mixed groups easier ? anyone got any thoughts ?
