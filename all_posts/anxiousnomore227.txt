photo by fotovizions i thought i would discuss what i use as my favorite tools and resources for learning about and dealing with my anxiety phobias all of these are listed on the right hand side of the blog that i leave up normally so you can refer back to any of them anytime its a long post i know but its i believe its very valueable for those trying to figure things out reading material the biggest help that i have gotten seriously it has changed my whole perspective on everything has been from the book the anxiety and phobia workbook fourth edition by edmund j bourne i am not one that buys books very often and i came across the third edition of this series in my public library it was so amazing i kept it until i wasn t allowed to renew it any longer i returned it sadly and then decided i had to have my own copy as a resource that i could use whenever needed the guidance in this book is amazing it touches on everything that i can think of on how to manage and get rid of your anxiety and phobias i haven t gotten to the getting rid of part because i am still getting used to managing my anxiety first i highly recommend trying to find this book if you are looking for something to help you , especially if you can t afford to see a specialist or a therapist before this book i was hopeless and it gave me the motivation to take control of my life again main things that helped me in this book was learning about self talk , positive affirmations and mistaken beliefs medication i take a daily dose of mg of zoloft at first i was really skeptical about taking the medication because i didn t want to be reliant on it i fell into the stigma that most people have about mental health medicine that you should be able to control your own thoughts i have since learned that some brains are simply hard wired different and need the medication to work properly if you are diabetic , you take insulin and no one questions it , its what you need so i take that daily and have been doing much better since i have been consistent with it i also take clonozapam when i need it as an additional way to calm my nerves and that helps tremendously spiritual belief system i have a firm faith in my beliefs that we are put on this earth to be tried and tested i know that we are only given adversities that heavenly father knows we can handle even though it might seem so overwhelming to us i know that he helps me along the way as i continue to ask for it and pray for it i encourage everyone to figure out their own spiritual belief system as it gives a firm foundation for when things get rocky one of my favorite quotes says , therefore , how can you and i really expect to glide naively through life , as if to say , 'lord , give me experience , but not grief , not sorrow , not pain , not opposition , not betrayal , and certainly not to be forsaken keep from me , lord , all those experiences which made thee what thou art ! then let me come ad dwell with thee and fully share thy joy ! ' neal a maxwell yoga and regular exercise i am not as consistent as this as i would like to be , but anytime i finish a workout or a yoga session i feel better immediately i have found yoga to be more of a help especially an interesting article i found says , yoga 's postures , controlled breathing and meditation may work together to help ease brains plagued by anxiety or depression , a new study shows i don t need the study to tell me that , i have experienced it first hand i used to tivo a daily yoga show as corny as it was to do at home but when the show no longer played i had to find another method i like to work out at home , its too hard for me to keep up with going to the gym and i never end up going so i am borrowing an xbox that hardly gets used and i bought a dollar game at a used game store this game is awesome it s a personal trainer that does yoga and exercising with lots of other cool features therapist it was a blow to my ego but when things got really bad i had to face the music that i was in over my head i went and saw a therapist who was able to help me point out my negative thoughts when i didn t realize i was thinking that way journaling journaling is a great way to figure out your thoughts and feelings and mentally unwind that s why i started this blog its my journal and has been extremely therapeutic for me vitamin b supplement this is a daily pill that helps manage the nervous system that is an additional more herbal remedy as opposed to clonozapam family and friends having a support person is important someone that knows whats going on so that if you have to leave suddenly or have symptoms coming on , they are there to help you and be there for you sometimes having that support person with you in a trigger situation can be enough to help you stay calm plus as i have mentioned before , than your secret is out and you don t have to try so hard to meet everyone s expectations and you can focus on other things i only tell my closest family and friends about it , plus all of you of course , but i try not to tell people that i feel aren t on a need to know basis expressing yourself creatively i find it important to express myself in relaxing ways that help me define who i am i do this with gardening , playing the piano , scrapbooking , blogging , and photography all of these hobbies give me a sense of accomplishment and let me know that i am worthwhile as a person they give me strength to want to better myself in all areas of my life down time its vitally important to give your mind some rest this includes getting a full night s sleep , time management , and making room in your schedule for relax time time where you do nothing but meditate or veg out , anything that s relaxing taking a bath , watch tv , just exist some of these may work better than others for you and your situation whats important is finding out what it is that works best for you i 'd love to hear if anyone else has other tools or resources or ideas that help them if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety
