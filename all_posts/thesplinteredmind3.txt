sometimes writer s block is due to road work ahead i wish the roadblocks of life would announce themselves better then i could chart my detours in time to avoid them maybe they could have mechanized arms to wave at me , catching my attention as i rocket from point a to point b most roadblocks in life do give me advance warning it s the ones that family members throw up in my way that catch me off guard it is as if they announce the upcoming construction by standing on the side of a road with a postcard filled with tiny hand scratchings that somewhat resemble english they don t even so much as nod their head at me sometimes , i m blowing by them so quickly , i don t notice them , but for the most part , their troubles go off like bombs in my life then i find myself swerving out of the way , slamming on my breaks , or just careening into their manmade ditch surprise ! somebody s having a bad day ! my life has been like that lately , especially over the summer i wish i could offer myself some advice on how to avoid these pitfalls , but i have little to no control over other people s lives i had such big plans for this year i was going to be amazing the stars would twinkle their approval even through the light polluted sky i would accomplish great things instead , i m scrambling to get even one book finished this year i read a blog today by an author boasting about how prolific he was he made sure to point out several times that he was a single dad raising a kid you know , to drive into his reader s brains how incredibly awesome he was i don t have the ability to tune out stress and drama while keeping on track family drama scatters into my life like an upturned box of tacks in the road this year , my youngest daughter s mental issues reached a head it involved a new school , counseling , and group therapy on top of our already busy schedule with her physical therapy for cerebral palsy , monthly seizures epilepsy , and meltdowns teenager with disabilities then i had to enroll her back in the old school our home became a battle zone , and with the increased stress , my tourette s became exacerbated , which then created strange , unproductive synergies with my adhd i had energy enough to take care of her needs , then collapse on the couch at the end of the day , mindlessly watching tv while i recovered the problem is that i can t think while i m ticking the sensation is as if my mind is having tremors while i m unable to concentrate on anything else tv distracts , but by the time i come around , the night is late , and it is time to prepare for the morrow the end result was that i didn t blog for my editor , i didn t blog for myself , and i didn t write much either the upside was that my daughter s needs were taken care of , and that we made huge progress with her everything is much better now , or else i wouldn t be able to post this update upon consideration , i suppose i do have some advice to give myself play with the cards you re dealt we don t always have control over our lives as much as we d like there are responsibilities , emergencies , and disabilities that spring up roadblocks in our path they arrive unannounced and make a mess of things however , if we have even a tiny idea of where we re going , we can keep ourselves moving forward my goal was to finish pok mon ultra beasts in easy steps last spring ! then i d have a half a year of sales before the next pok mon game dropped , whereupon i d update the book quickly to include the new game , and get more sales meanwhile , i d have moved on to my twelve ways to fight off depression , finished it , then begun my middle grade novel in september yes , great things now i m eight months behind schedule , i ve discovered that nobody wants ultra beasts , and the year is almost over oh , well here s what i am going to do instead since the new game drops this friday , i m going to attend the nami conference tomorrow , finish the first draft of my book by wednesday , and then work on my middle grade novel until friday then i ll update my book and prepare it for a december launch i m not sure if i ll write about pok mon again after this i was a game reviewer before i began blogging years ago , so it s not a wild divergence for me it s just not the subject matter that burns in my heart and demands to be let free thank you for following along i realize people expect me to be an expert , and some lose faith in me when i pull the curtain back and reveal the man behind it , but this is how i ve always dealt with my limitations i admit them i analyze them i attack them , and then i achieve victory if you like books with self analysis , you ll love reading saying no to suicide
