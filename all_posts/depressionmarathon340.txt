thank god it 's the last day of january this is not my favorite month of the year this year has been exceptionally tough almost entirely due to the extreme weather we 've been experiencing at least the days are getting longer unfortunately the cold and snow have kept us locked up inside and unable to enjoy most days it 's been a long month this last day of january is an anniversary of sorts it was years ago today , when i was a junior in high school , that i nearly ended my life with a serious suicide attempt for some reason , this day usually stands out on the calendar , as it is today i had severe , untreated , largely ignored depression as a teenager it began around age by the time i reached , i was completely tapped out my suicide attempt was classic i planned it for weeks i gave things away and said goodbye in various , unrecognized ways i played what i planned to be my final high school basketball game lastly , i finished all of my final exams , acing every one i was ready to be done obviously , i did n't get my wish , and i am here today to remember the anniversary instead i have a variety of jumbled , mixed up feelings about this day and that event they are too jumbled and mixed up to even explain so i 'll just note the day it is , after all , part of my story my mood has fluctuated over the past week i was doing well , so well that my doctor and i reduced one of my meds it 's the med primarily responsible for my weight gain with all i 've been physically doing and how i 've been eating , i should not be gaining weight , but i am i am now close to the heaviest i have ever been most of my clothes do not fit , and running is more difficult than it needs to be it 's very frustrating fortunately , after only a few days at the slightly lower dose of the fat med , i felt physically better i had two demanding runs that felt easier , too that was nice unfortunately , earlier this week my mood took a dive , and i suffered through a couple of long , low days it was difficult and frightening , and my doctor rescinded her order so today i'm back up to the original dose of the fat med i'm frustrated again , especially since my mood is better today my mood actually began improving yesterday i went to an extra aa meeting last night , and that was helpful , too of course , i do n't want to take the higher dose of the fat med , but i try my best not to play doctor , so i 'll probably comply i understand my psychiatrist 's cautiousness neither of us wants me to go through what i just went through again i'm praying my mood gets a little more stable in the next few days and weeks so we can discuss lowering the fat med once again that 's the story for today , my friends the sun is shining on my little world , camouflaging the fact that it 's nearly below zero outside i'm scheduled to run miles tomorrow , so i hope the temperature rises ! i'm glad it 's only the weather which is one of my big concerns today simple life is life right now , and i 'll take it carry on !
