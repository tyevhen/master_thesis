recently , i ve been very down the old depressive feelings are , kind of , coming back feelings of worthlessness , what s the point , the world is a horrible place , and i guess i ll go eat dirt because i am sensing more depression lately , i am scared this is the beginning of a relapse in addition , i am completely off the anti depressants , so that s another reason for me to be worried about returning symptoms i was supposed to monitor how i ve been feeling since coming off the medication , but the extra attention to my moods isn t exactly helping my cause i ve been putting too much focus on how i feel which is resulting in finding problems where there aren t any the good thing is , however , i am still functioning i am still getting out of bed in the morning am counts , i am still eating even though i don t want to , and i am still taking care of myself i am hard on myself because i am not yet perfect i want to get up at am every day i want to eat healthy and exercise moderately i want to paint every day i want to be a good friend , sister , and wife i want to fill my schedule with volunteer work i want to be able to say yes when asked a favor i want to go to daily mass i want to achieve great things i want , i want , i want in reality , i just want to be perfect right now because i am not yet where i want to be , there must be something wrong , right ? people who struggle with depression and anxiety have common all or nothing characteristics it is either black or white , right or wrong , all or nothing we can t see the gray area , and we have a difficult time with compromise but only when it comes to our own lives are we that strict we are rarely that hard on other people , especially loved ones so , this bad week is , in my mind , a relapse i am not good , so i am bad i am not healing , so i must be hurting i am not happy , therefore , i am depressed luckily , this past year , i ve learned healthy coping skills to deal with situations like this one and i ve also learned how to stop the snowball of negative thoughts before it turns into an avalanche how do i do that ? first , i have to be my own best friend since i have a difficult time loving myself , i treat myself as i would treat a loved one with compassion and unconditional forgiveness second , i have to remind myself of my all or nothing tendencies just knowing that i am typically unrealistic can help me calm down third , a relapse is not a do over i am much better equipped to handle a fit of depression this time around compared to the last time so , even if i do have a relapse , i will be ok and last , but not least , my symptoms are nowhere near as severe as last summer i know this is true because my husband , craig , and i made a list of warning signs so he and i will know when things are getting really bad bad as in relapse bad bad as in need to re evaluate the whole no more medication bad my early warning signals emotional isolation practicing eating disorder behaviors crying myself to sleep every night obsessive list making avoiding going places out of fear obsessively exercising drinking alcohol staying in bed all day the last two would merit a trip to the hospital the other six warning signs need to happen frequently over an extended period of time to cause any alarm for example , the other day i made a wicked unrealistic list of , at least , a hundred things i wanted to do in one day but , with craig s help , i was able to throw that list away we talked through it and i was reminded that i don t want to go down that road again comparatively speaking , i am actually doing really well i may not be where i want to be , i may not be perfect , but that shouldn t stop me from giving myself some credit perfectionism is a dangerous things and it can hold anyone back from living a fulfilling life i don t have to wait until i am perfect to start living if i look at things under a positive light , i can allow myself some praise for my accomplishments , however small and minuscule they seem to me this practice is crucial part of seeing the value in your own life if you want to get over your paralyzing perfectionism , don t be ashamed of giving yourself praise , compliments , or a pat on the back for your achievements , even if they are minor successes sometimes , we fail to recognize the good in ourselves because we are afraid of appearing vain or big headed on the flip side , if we constantly berate ourselves , we will have a difficult time finding value in our lives , which can sometimes have worse results than having a bit of self worth my prayer is to see myself as god sees me , to love myself as god loves me i am proud of myself for coming off my medication i am happy that i finished a difficult painting recently and it turned out great i am pleased with myself that i tried a new recipe and it was a hit i give myself a pat on the back for regularly posting to this blog if i can find some good in me , instead of just focusing on all my flaws , i will have a greater chance of overcoming this depression i am not at the beginning of a relapse i am doing just fine if you liked this article , check out these posts all or nothing drama paralyzing perfectionism tapering off the medication
