ever thought of using a dropbox to help with anxiety , worry or fear ? before you all rush off to your laptops and sign up for this service although who wouldn t want a place to stash a gazillion photos , doc , videos and files and have instant access ? i m not referring to the technical dropbox i m talking about a physical one a jar , shoebox , or even an envelope , where you can drop off your worries i know some of my friends use a gratitude jar to use this , they jot down anything they are grateful for during that day or week the idea is to empty the jar at the end of the year and have a host of happy and grateful memories to remind yourself of how blessed you are the drop off box works in a similar way had a bad day ? jot down why it was bad , who upset you and how you feel about it screw up the piece of paper and drop it in the jar add every worry , fear or anxious thought you have into it at the end of each month or week if it s been a tough one take great pleasure in emptying the contents into your rubbish bin , or recycling bag if you are feeling especially snarly you can burn it ! when my marriage ended , i wrote my ex husband a long letter explaining how all the things he had done to me had made me feel i poured everything i had held in over seven years onto the page no one other than me ever read it i burnt it in my chiminea as soon as i d finished writing , and i watched the sheets of paper disappear in a puff of smoke and ash , along with my anxiety this stuff had been eating away at me for years , and i was so relieved to be able to drop it off and feel weightless again n b please adhere to fire safety if you choose to burn your paper you don t want to add to your stress and anxiety by burning down your house or injuring yourself at the moment i am in limbo with an undiagnosed health issue , this is causing me to feel anxious and frustrated , and it was the main reason for creating my dropbox when i explained to my children what i was doing , my daughter grabbed the notebook , scribbled a little note and dropped it in the jar that s great , she said , i had a really bad day at school , and now i feel much better have a go at getting creative and make your own dropbox , or use an old tupperware box , an envelope or a shoe box whatever you have to hand will work for my dropbox , i used an empty coffee jar and soaked off the label i then decopatched the outside to make it look bright and cheerful after all , it s a good thing to release your stress i tied a bow on the top because i have brief moments of being a girly girl and then it was ready to go here s to a stress free life , an anxiety free zone and a reason to have more bbq s this summer got to love the hot coals after the food is cooked , great for burning your negative thoughts ! how do you release your stress and anxiety ? share it with us in the comments below
