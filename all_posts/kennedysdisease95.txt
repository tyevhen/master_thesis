by now , you can probably tell that i like to write whether i am any good at it , is something for each of you to decide i never thought of writing anything until my s and then i found the passion my biggest problem with writing is consistency writing every day when i am in the zone , i find it easy to write for hours unfortunately , my discipline began to wane a couple of years ago and i found myself writing less frequently once i stopped writing every day , the stories my imagination began to dry up where i once found it easy to get into character , i now struggle with it regaining that sense of being the character 's personality several years ago , i finished my book a fantasy story and edited it once it now sits in my office closet because it needs another edit and i just lost interest writing a story is the easy part editing your story is hard work requiring a lot of patience and a cutthroat attitude i find it difficult to edit my own stories i often tend to see what i thought i wrote and not what i actually wrote i published several short stories in the the writer 's corner some stories are true , but most are just figments of my imagination even though some are based upon personal experiences brothers in blood , no two minute warning , and will i finally find some peace ? are stories about my second vietnam tour a cat 's tale and broken promises are stories about our two cats they are based upon many personal experiences and observations the age of innocence is the first story i wrote and it was actually published in a magazine i have a few more stories that i wrote , but have not taken the time to publish them do you see what i mean about lack of discipline ? one selfish reason i began blogging was to see if i could regain that discipline that is needed to write daily so far , i have done pretty well i am also reading a lot of articles on blogging in an attempt to improve the quality of the articles unfortunately , i have not found that rhythm that i felt a few years ago where stories came to me night and day , and writing was exciting and fulfilling what has this post to do with kennedy 's disease ? since i am retired and find it difficult to hike , work in the shop , play tennis , sail , ride my bike , or do most anything else outdoors , writing became my passion it allows me to redirect my creative side and keep my mind and hands busy you could call it a hobby , but in many ways , it is so much more this post is meant to be a self confession and hopefully a wakeup call let 's hope it works because i feel the need please feel free to comment by taking a moment to share your thoughts you add much to these articles the articles then become more than just something i said or believe in addition , by adding a comment , you might just be helping the next reader by sharing your opinion , experience , or a helpful tip you can comment by clicking on comments below or by sending me an email i look forward to hearing from you
