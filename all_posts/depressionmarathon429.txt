okay , mother nature ! i totally give up ! uncle ! uncle ! what can we do to make it stop ? this morning 's workout called for seven half mile repeats on a beautiful , spongy , oval track afterward , i planned to linger on the luxuriously green infield grass stretching my tired muscles slowly while soaking in the sun that was the plan and it was a wonderfully appealing plan ! and then i woke up this is a photo of jet taken one week ago in my backyard he was making me laugh , as usual he discovered this large piece of lumbar under the fence and proceeded , with all his might , to drag it all over the yard he dragged it , attacked it , tossed it , hurdled it , chewed it , barked at it , and generally romped around with it for the better part of an hour he was in heaven ! but then again , he 's pretty easy he finds tiny sticks , flying leaves , unearthed rocks , and even pieces of wayward trash to be heavenly toys as well the picture above is my little boy racing through our backyard this morning ! now you understand my first paragraph ! unlike his mom , jet thinks this is just fabulous ! he could n't wait to get outside ! he 's been out for almost three hours now , and he 's barely stopped moving if he could speak , i'm sure i would hear him screaming , wheeeeeeee ! i wish i could share your enthusiasm , buddy but instead of a nice soft track on which to run fast and luxurious green grass on which to stretch , i now face stationary breathlessness on a revolving rubberized belt breathing stale , sweaty , shared air my favorite and as you can see in the last photo , the snow is showing no signs of letting up so what 's the deal , mother nature ? it appears you are currently catering to the canines that 's nice my little canine certainly entertains me but will it be our turn soon ? i ca n't wait for my opportunity to squeal , wheeeeeeee , too !
