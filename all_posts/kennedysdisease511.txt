it has been two months since i was diagnosed with a blood clot in my calf since then , the blood thinning process has not been without problems when i read it could be difficult , i never thought it meant experiencing large swings and constant visits to the doctor for inr testing the first couple of weeks my blood would not thin with new instructions no broccoli and reduce the number of other items with vitamin k and an increase in the medication , my blood finally thinned to but , it worked too well and the next test showed okay , new instructions reduce the medication and have a couple of salads when we checked again , it was now too low again okay , maintain the dosage , but stop eating all salads , do not drink green tea , and , stop taking my multi vitamin and coq when we checked this friday , i was in the zone again the latest instructions are to keep doing what i am doing and not doing and come back in two weeks for a person that sees his doctor once a year for his annual physical , i have had eight visits so far in two months every time i step into the lobby , there are six to twelve people waiting some are coughing oh oh , some look in pain probably nothing to worry about , and some look healthy whew okay , let s review a the good news i have not experienced any pain or swelling in the calf since week two i am two months into a six month regiment i increased my calf exercise routines i don t sit very long without getting up and moving around i haven t bitten my tongue recently b the bad news my blood won t stabilize within the recommended level these doctor s office visits for inr testing are getting old fast i miss my daily luncheon salad and my green tea i still have four more months left at least i hope that is all c lesson learned keep moving !
