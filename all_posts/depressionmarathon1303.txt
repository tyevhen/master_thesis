prester john march , at pm dear etta sometimes i feel like my personality , my addictions , and my depression have somehow colluded to ruin my little life other times i think i m really just a maladjusted dysfunctional goof ball the few times my depression has really been beaten back in the last eight years or so i immediately begin to doubt that i was ever sick and that i was just somehow allowing life to kick my ass before i can make any real progress though , it comes creeping back and becomes the thing that defines me etta march , at pm dear prester john ain t depression grand ? ! what other illness could screw a normal , hey i m feeling better day or moment into another reason to worry rather than celebrate ? gotta love it i know exactly what you are talking about fortunately , i have a wonderful therapist who was able to teach me , finally , after seven years of this fun , that negative thinking is actually one of the symptoms of depression ! rather than a cause , as most well meaning friends will tell you , negative thinking is actually a part of or a result of the illness not the other way around that gives me some relief on those good days when my mind starts trying to f it up prester john march , at am dear etta negative thinking is actually one of the symptoms of depression ! i ve never heard that before in fact , the joke of a therapist i had several years ago once noted how negative my thinking was mind you my life was disintegrating around me even if i hadn t been depressed i d have certainly been under a lot of stress thanks this brief conversation over on crackedheadblog led to prester john checking out my february post titled , the symptom of thinking he then gave me one of the nicest compliments any writer could receive , which you may read for yourself , as i am going to rerun that original post today after re reading the post myself , i also thanked my psychologist she was the person responsible for the revelation that negative thinking is a symptom , not a cause , of depression so simple but so counter to everything we learn and hear this is a big deal thank you , deb keep spreading the news ! wednesday , february , the symptom of thinking no resolution yet to this most recent mind numbing , purposeless rut but maybe a reprieve yesterday , i swam today , i ran two consecutive days of exercise , and yet i still feel bad that 's the mind numbing part even when i take positive steps to take care of myself , the satisfaction which would normally follow is stolen quickly away i'm left in a blank stare thinking , and what was the purpose of that ? depression is a clever demon it steals the meaning from the meaningful strips the purpose from the purposeful life becomes a slow series of steps , literal steps , one foot in front of the other , with no reason for the journey nor reward at the end so i ask again , what 's the point ? intellectually , i know exactly the point my brain knows there is purpose even where i feel none my mind is numb , but my brain knows my brain , as if detached and looking in on the scene , answers the question as i methodically remove my sweaty running gear this is helpful , it says , even though your body wo n't let you know you have to keep moving forward you 'll only feel worse if you stop that 's been one of the few times my brain has been able to squeeze a word in lately depression is clever and consuming it normally boxes out those rational thoughts i assume , after swimming , or running , or cleaning that i will feel the satisfaction of my accomplishment a sliver of pride , maybe ? not so when depression is running the show no matter how positive the steps i take , depression bombards me with unrelenting disparaging , derogatory , and demoralizing thoughts there is no room for rationality nor emotion when depression 's thoughts consume me it took me a long time to learn and trust that these horrible , put down thoughts are actually a symptom of this illness sneaky depression ! the thoughts are mine , are n't they ? if we listen to most people , depression is the result of our negative thinking our own character defect hence , the popular fallacy that we can cure depression by smiling and thinking happy thoughts ! but it 's not true ! finally , after years of illness , thousands of hours of therapy , multiple hospitalizations , and countless treatment regimens , i learned that these all consuming , horrid thoughts are a symptom not a personality flaw a symptom , not a personality flaw now that 's a thought ! copyright to me etta pm comments
