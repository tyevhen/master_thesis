towards fairbanks , oil on panel , x , the swan by mary oliver did you too see it , drifting , all night , on the black river ? did you see it in the morning , rising into the silvery air an armful of white blossoms , a perfect commotion of silk and linen as it leaned into the bondage of its wings a snowbank , a bank of lilies , biting the air with its black beak ? did you hear it , fluting and whistling a shrill dark music like the rain pelting the trees like a waterfall knifing down the black ledges ? and did you see it , finally , just under the clouds a white cross streaming across the sky , its feet like black leaves , its wings like the stretching light of the river ? and did you feel it , in your heart , how it pertained to everything ? and have you too finally figured out what beauty is for ? and have you changed your life ? this painting and two other new landscapes are available at abbozzo gallery ! wishing you a happy holiday and a wonderful new year !
