this first paragraph was written last night i ended up giving up after then and postponing the rest until today ! p so , you know how i said i was going to write a daily journal entry unless i was having too much fun ? well , i was having too much fun ! i'm honestly torn about whether or not i should write about the conference now , because i only arrived home today at about pm and i'm ridiculously tired hanging out with people was the priority at the conference , not sleep , but at the same time i really want to write about it while everything is still fresh in my mind ! so i'm going to plow through the exhaustion , and hope that what i write is n't complete crap ! as i said above , i gave up on that idea instead , i'm writing wednesday , when i'm slightly only slightly less sleep deprived ! day i counted the first day of travel as day which also happens to be august the th was emilie 's th birthday , as well as being the first day of the conference ! i felt really bad when i forgot to wish her a happy birthday in the morning , but a friend of hers had discovered when her birthday was and made her a lovely card , then got it signed by a ton of people at the conference it was really sweet , and made emi happy conference registration opened , and people just hung around the registration area talking i did n't really know anyone well , so i was being pretty shy my mom started talking to people so i just trailed around bouncing between my mom and emi , until i got into a conversation , along with my mom , with erika i have to thank her for being the first person to make me relax and laugh ! i went to eli 's world travel photos session , and although there was n't a great turnout apparently the first time slot in a conference is n't necessarily the best , i enjoyed seeing the cool photos , and i had some interesting conversations with the people who were there about montreal , quebec , our culture and history , family history , and similar interesting things i also got a henna tattoo , which is something i 've wanted to do for a while , so i'm happy i finally did ! it 's mostly worn off by today , but it 's still visible the whole afternoon my mom was stealthily arranging a surprise for my sister in the evening , just before karaoke started , they played happy birthday and pulled out a cake she was completely surprised , so that was awesome since i'm not exactly much of a karaoke person , i headed outside to throw a frisbee around with a bunch of people instead now frisbees , i like after that , i headed to bed probably my earliest night of the whole week ! day august this day was lots of fun , but so long it almost felt like two separate days ! first off , i stumbled down to the tie dye workshop , where i greatly enjoyed dyeing my shirt in cool ways i'm thrilled with how it turned out ! i also got my feet and legs dyed , thanks to some very enthusiastic young kids with squirting dye bottles ! i then went to the artist trading card funshop i 'd never heard of atc 's before , but i love the idea ! you take a small card by i believe and do whatever you want with it collage , painting , drawing , basically creating a miniature work of art , then trade it with someone else for their miniature work of art that way , everyone ends up with awesome artwork from all different people really cool ! the card at the top i could n't get the picture to rotate for some reason has the most wonderful little story it reads a lone fisherman sat on a stretch of beach his single fishing pole was planted in the sand along came a businessman on vacation why do n't you have two poles so you can catch more fish ? the business asked then what would i do ? asked the fisherman then you could take the extra money , buy a boat , get nets and a crew , and catch even more fish then what would i do ? asked the corsican then , said the businessman , you could move up to a fleet of large ships , go whole sale , and become very rich then what would i do ? asked the corsican do whatever you want ! shouted the businessman and the corsican replied , i am after lunch or in my case most probably after hanging around with people or something , since i was either too busy or did n't feel like eating most of the time while i was there ! i went to a discussion called unschooling teens , then to one called sex , drugs , and alcohol , both of which were interesting then i went to a session with michael about glbt issues , which ended up being more of a presentation on transgender issues , which i'm glad of it was a great session ! i think that too often people focus entirely on sexual orientation , and forget that gender identity is something extremely important that more people should be talking about ! edit bonnie wrote a cool post on that here that evening , i stayed up late talking to people and listening to beautiful music played , and sung , by julian check out his stuff here day august went to erika and kathryn 's even more different talk , which was great and really got me thinking after that , i spent most of the lunch break having fascinating conversations i picked at food a bit , talked to people a lot , then went to eli and my discussion , untraditional adult paths there was a really good turnout , which tells me that this is something that should be talked about more at unschooling conferences , since apparently it interests a lot of people ! i feel it went really well most people were a lot more interested in eli 's input , since he 's been doing things untraditionally for a while now , but i'm happy with what input i did give , and it was great to hear from several people who have managed quite well without either college or regular jobs after that , i went to a photograohy funshop ! there were only a few of us , so basically we just hung around chatting about photography , then wandered around a bit taking pictures it was fun we fed a couple of people sandwiches , then it was on to the entertainment of the evening an absolutely awesome band called fishing with finnegan , made up of grown unschooling siblings , was playing , and they were tons of fun they play irish , scottish , english , and american folk , and they do it with much humour and a unique flair i highly reccomend that you check them out ! after the concert , i sat around talking with a couple of of the band members , as well as the other cool people i 'd been hanging out with even once the band members were dragged away by the rest of their family , i stayed talking to people for a while more are you noticing a theme here ? another long but good day day august the last official day of the conference , i was finally relaxed enough to pretty much just be myself that always seems to happen with me i only ever relax at the end of an event ! after closing remarks , i , can you guess ? yup , hung around talking to people for a couple of hours ! then i played a game that was quite popular , especially with the moms they were intense at that game scarily intense o o , called bananagrams annnd after that , virtually everyone who had n't left right after closing remarks went out for sushi ! it was kind of funny actually someone called the restaurant ahead of time to make reservations , but the restaurant understood the reservation to be for to people , when really it was for ! ! luckily , they managed to fit all of us in more people went then had oroginally said they would my table played hang man with much laughter and joking around while we waited for our food , and the sushi was really good fun times having entirely given up on getting any decent sleep while still at the con , i was up late with a bunch of people who decided to not sleep at all i was actually one of the first to bed , at or so ! day august the last conference activity was a picnic in salem , right on the beach i played frisbee , hung around with peeps , and went for a long walk on the beach i also came very close to heading straight to texas for the rethinking education conference with a couple of friends ! it was a crazy plan that ended up not working out airfare was just too expensive , but it really brought home the fact that it 's very possible to just take off across the country when you feel like it , so i 've decided i'm going next year that conference looks awesome , and there 's no reason why i should n't go ! it was sad saying goodbye to everyone , and the hotel felt so very quiet and lonely that night day september we drove home pretty simple , really now , this post feels like such a skimming of the surface and i'm sure i'm forgetting a lot of the surface stuff as well i had so many wonderful conversations , such a wonderful time overall , so many new thoughts and realizations , that i ca n't possibly fit it all into one post there are several issues and things that i plan on devoting whole posts too , but for now this will do some interesting posts you may want to check out , that are to do with this conference , are jean 's post on unparenting at the conference it was pretty bad , and bonnie 's posts entitled shit happens even to unschoolers and highlights from neuc eli also wrote an overview of the conference here as i said , more to come soon ! peace , idzie
