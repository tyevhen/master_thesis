i am taking part of this from somewhere but i lost where ? part from shirley ward the brainstem takes care of sensations and vital functions such as breathing , heart rate , hormonal output , the alimentary canal , digestion and urinary processes interestingly , during the zygotic period after fertilization of the ovum , the first organ to develop is the alimentary canal and digestive system bodily sensations of fear , such as stomach butterflies or pain , originate in the alimentary canal and digestive system after fertilization , an embryo develops from the rd week , the primal brain structures the spinal cord , midbrain developing simultaneously with the organs and limbs the brain body architecture morphs into recognizable form by the th week of womb life the first three months of womb life are ostensibly the most critical period of human development , because this is the time when all internal and external brain and bodily structures develop during this critical period , the exposure of an embryo to certain agents such as chemicals , drugs , alcohol , nicotine and or cortisol may cause major congenital malformations and safety are of paramount importance the period from the beginning of the rd month to the birth is known as the fetal period the main characteristic of the fetus in this period is the rapid growth of the body and the brain and the maturation of the tissues the brain functions in a partnership with the body and early embryonic memories are stored in the cellular structures of the body as well as the brain the zygote , embryo or early fetus has primary needs which can be met by the parents these primary needs require the mother and father to be nourished in the healthiest way , to be fit and not have toxins in their bodies the mother needs to be calm and contained , in other words , happy and contented she needs to know that her partner will support and help her the father of the baby needs to be involved and taking full responsibility for his paternity it is best if each member of the couple loves each other and that they exist in a peaceful society this state of affairs creates the best possible conditions for the tiny being to develop in the womb very early experiences of stress or traumatic events in the womb , such as lack of oxygen or nourishment , or increased cortisol levels when a mother is exposed to prolonged or severe stress , will affect the brain stem neuro hormonal and chemical receptors and pathways of the brain are permanently affected by stress in the early period of brain development of the embryo a state of war , food shortages , famine , violence , conflict or loss will induce severe fear and anxiety in the parents , and particularly the mother , affecting the neuro chemical development of the unborn child when , as adults , we experience inexplicable symptoms for example , sweating , increased heart rate and respiration , it may be that our primal brainstem memory is being triggered many people experience adult anxiety , panic attacks , fear , depression and other so called psychiatric symptoms , which may well be related to the very early months of womb experience a zygote and early embryo holds cellular memories of womb events in the body no information is ever lost think about this in terms of trauma it means that whole groups of people may be carrying memories of trauma that many generations ago and echoes of which are stored in the body and particularly in the brain stem unfortunately , because these memories are not easily retrieved , humans tend to act out their traumatic imprints on others and the world around them it is incumbent on us to prevent unnecessary trauma occurring to our offspring , and therefore recommended that each one of us , both individually and collectively , become conscious of our own traumatic imprints and commence a healing journey , both alone and with others this link to shirley ward s article describes how people feel when they are assisted to relive their early conception experiences http primal page com ward htm love , the way humans feel love , is the greatest force in the universe it is love that will help us heal and reassemble our past and our future it is love that will help us to educate , to guide and to show others how to conceive in love
