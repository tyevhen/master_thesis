things are improved today i'm emptying out that pity pot it 's stuffed full from yesterday 's dive , but i'm extricating myself from the muck nonetheless my hip is better , though still not right my worst fear may be true i may have re torn the labrum for a third time , but i know there is nothing i can do about that now less pain today i 'll try a couple miles tomorrow after arriving in duluth heck , if i determine it 'd be too dangerous to run yah , right ! ! , i can help my friends sell running shoes at the expo again ! they own a shoe store , and i helped them hawk running shoes last year my dream job ! i love high tech shoes ! i had a blast ! i'm sure i 'll run and i'm feeling better about that today i'm home alone tonight , which i hate my parents are watching puck it 's so quiet in the house without him but he loves them , and they love him , so i'm sure he 's quite content wish my mood was a bit better going into this race , but such is the nature of this illness , huh ? another reality over which i have little control on my way to bed now long drive in the morning , and an unexpected road closing in duluth could make for a very interesting journey for thousands of runners and fans hope to avoid the mess by getting an early start i'm rambling now i guess that 's exactly how i feel not up , nor down happy , nor sad excited , nor apprehensive i just am i just am i guess that 's okay good night
