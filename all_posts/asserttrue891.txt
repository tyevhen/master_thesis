i 've been playing with sling lately , and i was pleasantly surprised to find that sling comes with a json query servlet that exposes sql and xpath query capability through a restful http get syntax thanks to moritz havelock for pointing this out but i quickly ran into a small problem and just as quickly , the solution allow me to explain the problem i want to search for nodes in the repository that have a multivalued pets attribute containing the value dog note that the pets attribute might have multiple values i want to filter against just one therefore i ca n't do an equality test i must use the xpath contains function my test query was http localhost content query json ? querytype xpath statement contains pets , 'dog' this produced an invalidqueryexception , with a message of unsupported function contains i was a bit surprised that the servlet seemed to know nothing about any contains function a true wtf moment taking my hint from the stack trace , i quickly ran a google code search on org apache jackrabbit core query xpath , and immediately found the answer in xpathquerybuilder java it turns out you have to use the function 's qualified name , jcr contains like so http localhost content query json ? querytype xpath statement jcr contains pets , 'dog' i'm so much of an xpath newb that i do n't even know if i should have been surprised by this , but it did stymie me briefly anyway , it works now and i'm thrilled to be able to do xpath queries right from the get go
