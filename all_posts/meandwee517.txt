this post was written in my other blog over valentines hello ! happy belated valentine 's day i'm pretty low key about the day , so i did n't feel like posting about it for those who have been following along with my drama of trying to conceive it was also the day that we met with our reproductive endocrinologist to find out the results of my seemingly thousands of blood tests most everything the possible blood clotting disorders and things like that came back normal yay ! but they found one thing i have a genetic mutation called the mthfr ct mutation the genetic polymorphisms of mthfr ct are associated with unexplained recurrent early spontanous abortion early miscarriages my re believes that this is what has been causing my losses a large percentage of the population has at least one mutation inherited i have mutations since i inherited one from my mom and one from my dad this is a lot more rare this is also reminding me of sophomore biology class anyway , apparently it is linked with risk for cardiovascular disease and blood clots in the veins grrrrreeeeaaaaaat so , as i understand it , they have to check my homocysteine levels each year to make sure they are n't too high thus causing clots and possible hardening of the arteries in the future the mutation if you have is also possibly linked to episodes of depression which i battle and possibly to migraines what do you do to help matters you ask ? well , i have to take a simple prescribed supplement with a ton of extra folic acid and vitamin b and vitamin b i will have to take it daily for the rest of my life now that i'm trying to have a child , i also have to take a prenatal vitamin along with it just to give me even more of aforementioned vitamins i 've already been taking them daily , but i guess it was n't nearly enough for me these will supposedly keep the levels of homocysteine down i guess the mutation causes my body not to process those particular vitamins properly and thus i need times more than the normal person not having enough folic acid can cause birth defects problems with an early pregnancy hence the miscarriages sorry for all the scientific talk , but i thought it would help for anyone else going through something similar overall , it 's a simple fix that supposedly should help me keep a pregnancy with me in the future we shall see i'm always tired , so i'm happy that i'm taking tons of extra b now it should give me my energy i always seem to lack a nice side effect ! i'm happy that 's all they found well , that and my slight t shaped uterus i mentioned in an earlier post and that it 's treatable so , valentine 's day brought us some much awaited and prayed for answers that beats out chocolates any day despite a few obstacles , it looks like the future for a wee one is looking much more bright save you might also like a t shaped uterus flashback loss number one flashback loss number three linkwithin
