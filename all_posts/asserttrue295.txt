pertussis , also known as whooping cough , is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by bordetella pertussis , a small aerobic bacterium that secretes numerous toxins capable of disrupting a normal immune response the disease is rarely fatal but leaves victims with a nasty cough that can last weeks in , in the u s , some , cases of pertussis were reported to the cdc of those cases , only were fatal by contrast , americans were killed by lightning the same year bordetella pertussis unlike tuberculosis which has been with us for million years , bordetella shows evidence of being a fairly new and still rapidly evolving pathogen , although in this case fairly new could still mean , years the complete dna sequence of b pertussis has been available for several years it shows a moderate size genome of million base pairs encoding , genes , with a substantial number of pseudogenes the latter represent genes that have by one means or another been inactivated , whether through the appearance of premature stop codons in the gene , loss of a promoter region , random deletions , or what have you what makes bordetella 's pseudogenes interesting is that they 're in remarkably good shape , as pseudogenes go usually , once a gene gets inactivated goes pseudo , it begins to accumulate random point mutations , deletions , insertions , etc at a substantial rate in other words it deteriorates , since supposedly it 's no longer under selection pressure but when australian researchers looked at pseudogenes in b pertussis tohama i strain , they were shocked to find that the rate of nucleotide polymorphisms i e , changes to individual base pairs in the dna was actually lower in pseudogenes than in regular genes e per site versus that 's exactly the opposite of what 's expected the researchers commented , somewhat laconically this suggests that most pseudogenes in b pertussis were formed in the recent past and are yet to accumulate more mutations than functional genes what other explanation is there ? well , the most obvious alternative explanation is that the genes are still under selection pressure , even though they 're turned off how can that be ? i can think of any number of scenarios perhaps that 'll be a future blog post suffice it for now to say , ribosomes are not totally unforgiving of missing stop codons read up on tmrna nor are they unforgiving , in all cases , of frameshifts read about programmed frameshifts , and if an open reading frame should appear on a pseudogene 's antisense strand , you now have an rna silencer potentially for the remaining good copy or copies of the gene , with attendant gene modulation possibilities it 's worth pointing out that pseudogenes in m leprae the leprosy bacterium are not only conserved and ancient but continue to show strong homology to working orthologues in m tuberculosis and even more distantly related organisms such as gordonia , corynebacterium , and nocardia after millions of years more of which , in a later post for now , i thought it might be worth looking at the base composition of b pertussis pseudogenes to see if they 're riddled with frameshift errors as is the case with m leprae 's pseudogenes when i analyzed all , , codons for all normal not pseudo genes in b pertussis tohama i strain , the resulting paintball diagram of base composition came up looking like this paintball diagram for normal genes in b pertussis tohama i click to enlarge red dots are for codon base one , gold represents the composition at codon base two , blue is wobble third base composition every dot represents statistics for one gene n see text for discussion here , we 're looking at purine a g content versus g c content for each base position in the codons every dot represents a gene 's worth of data not unexpectedly , the most extreme g c values occur in the third wobble base codon base one red dots is purine rich , centering on y this is typical of most codons in most genes , in most organisms notice the breakaway cloud of gold points underneath the main gold cloud at y these points represent genes in which the second codon base is mostly a pyrimidine c or t codons with a pyrimidine in base two tend to code for nonpolar amino acids thus , the breakaway cloud of gold points represents membrane associated proteins in this case , we 're looking at about genes falling in that category now look at the paintball diagram for the organism 's pseudogenes base composition for codons in pseudogenes of b pertussis tohama i click to enlarge in this graph , as in the one above , dots are rendered with an opacity of so that overlapping points are less likely to obscure each other see text for discussion in this case , there 's a considerable amount of random statistical splay , but some of that is due simply to the fact that pseudogenes are a good deal shorter than normal genes , giving rise to more noise in the signal in this case , the average length of a pseudogene is bases , vs for the , normal genes even with considerable noise , though , it 's apparent that the dot clusters tend to center on different parts of the graph , corresponding to the expected locations for normal genes contrast this with the situation in m leprae , where pseudogenes are riddled with frameshifts , rendering the concept of codon base position moot refer to the second paintball graph on this page thus , we can say with some confidence that frameshifts are not so rampant in b pertussis pseudogenes as to have rendered the concept of codons irrelevant in fact , compared to m leprae , pseudogenes in b pertussis are comparatively unaffected by frameshifts this tends to support the view of the australian researchers mentioned earlier that pseudogenes in b pertussis have not had enough time to accumulate very many mutations but it can also be hypothesized that b pertussis has had plenty of time , years , in fact in which to accumulate mutations in its pseudogenes , yet has not done so the evidence suggests that if anything , bordetella repairs pseudogenes even more faithfully than regular genes at this point it might be relevant to interject that while m leprae like other members of the mycobacteria lacks the muts mutl mismatch repair system , bordetella does , in fact , have a muts mutl mismatch repair system , and this may explain the relative paucity of frameshift errors in bordetella pseudogenes but it also implies rather queerly that bordetella goes out of its way to repair its pseudogenes interestingly , out of pseudogenes have a ag purine , base one content greater than , which means they 're probably still in frame of these , some have ag less than , meaning they 're most likely genes for membrane associated proteins if we look at the , normal genes that have ag greater than , only are putative membrane associated proteins with ag less than bottom line pseudogenes for putative membrane associated proteins are twice as likely to still be in frame while this could be a statistical fluke , it could also be that membrane proteins are somehow spared preferentially when it comes to leaving pseudogenes translatable to put it differently pseudogenes for non membrane associated proteins are less likely to remain in frame this makes sense , in that much of bordetella 's pathogenicity can be ascribed to proteins that make up cell surface antigens or that transport toxins to the outside world some of the toxic surface proteins may , in fact , be nonsense or partial nonsense proteins products of pseudogenes
