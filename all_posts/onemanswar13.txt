i don t know what good looks like i don t know what normal feels like , either finding a new norm is one of the challenges facing the mentally ill on their journey toward recovery take this week after a few good months of mental health a miracle for me it felt as though recovery was slipping through my fingers not feeling great isn t the worst part it s the paralyzing fear that things might go south , that the airplane bound for recovery might slowly lose altitude and nosedive into a fiery crash next to the pain of depression and the madness of anxiety , fear is the most troubling emotion my therapist has been helping me deal with fear and establish a new norm since my bipolar diagnosis for all i know , this squirrelly week may not be too far outside the norm only i wouldn t know because i m not sure what normal feels like my doctors at the menninger clinic in houston told me something important when i left relapse is often part of recovery in other words , it s normal to have set backs i ve only experienced one really tough relapse since returning from houston , which is a blessing it was painful , but it was brief if i only experience one or two of those a year , i ll take it the pursuit of normal may be a futile chase , like me trying to find a destination without a navigation app who s to say what normal looks like for anyone , much less a bipolar patient with an anxiety disorder ? we all end up strapped in roller coasters from time to time , unsure of how we got there we all feel the stomach drop when the coaster slowly ticks toward the top of a big hill , preparing us for what s to come we all know the feeling when it bends over the apex and rushes down in a free fall all of us not just those of us dealing with a wicked hand of genetic cards we ve been dealt that s one reason i think we can all benefit from therapy or at least talking to a friend who listens i ve had coffee with several struggling people i mostly listen even though i don t know what i m doing , they all seem to come away feeling better it s not anything i do it s the power of telling our story all of this advice makes me a hypocrite this week i haven t had the best week , and i haven t told anyone how i feel my wife finally asked me today if i m okay , and i wasn t fully honest i know a lot of people can relate we don t want to burden others we don t want to admit we might be struggling we don t want to scare our loved ones we don t want to accept the reality that every day or every week or every month won t be a good one that s why i jumped on the computer today and banged out this blog it might not be the best one i ve ever written , but at least it s a reminder of something i know to be true this disease can t be defeated by an army of one
