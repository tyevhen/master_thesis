boy , i 've been busy today ! here 's a short recap i started the day at my new job filling out paperwork after an hour there , i ran four errands all over town i went grocery shopping , which you know i hate doing because it takes too long and costs too much money but i did it after grabbing some lunch , i ran off to play nine holes of golf i did okay it was warm , but the wind was blowing over miles per hour so that made my beginner golf game even more interesting two hours of walking around whacking that ball was a luxurious break from triathlon training though by the time i returned home , i only had one hour before my aa meeting puck needed attention , as we did n't get out to exercise yesterday i knew i had a lot left to do tonight , including spending time with you , so i quickly loaded puck into the car and drove across town to the doggy swimming hole i knew it would be a bit chilly , as the ice just melted a few weeks ago , but i figured puck could handle it he did , although he was shaking like a leaf when i dried him off nevertheless , he appeared ecstatic he loves playing ball ! unfortunately , since he 's had both anterior cruciate ligaments replaced , i only allow him to play ball in the water now we did n't stay long i dropped him at home , fed him , and ran off to aa it was another good meeting tonight , and i really needed a good meeting i 've been noticing liquor stores lately that 's not a good thing it means i'm thinking a little screwy it means i need to go to a meeting even on an otherwise busy day ! it 's always helpful to sit down with other alcoholics and be reminded what life was like when alcohol was at its center life is a lot better now after the meeting , i spent an hour chopping up all the fruit and veggies i bought today i made a big salad for dinner , made tomorrow 's lunch , set up my oatmeal and coffee for breakfast , and organized my gear for the morning workout we 're doing a long brick at tomorrow morning after riding in a spinning class for minutes , we 'll run around the track for twenty then i 'll dash home , shower , eat and dash off to work phew i better get to bed ! good night , all
