i do n't have the energy right now to write a proper post the cold i had is completely gone yay ! but i feel grey and gloomy today however , a few days ago i took pictures of the snow and ice and dogs , and i wanted to post them here icy trees as seen through the window fresh snow flora winston i 'll try and write a proper post later on , since there 's been a million different ideas and thoughts flitting through my brain these last few days , and i really want to get some of them written down ! peace , idzie
