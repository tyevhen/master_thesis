in the old days i used a fake telephone to have patients call their parents and tell them everything , what they needed , the pain , etc one patient picked up the phone and then complained to me , there s no one home this was clearly a double entendre there was never anyone home , and when they were , there was still no one home but i used the telephone to make a point patients were always saying , what s the use ? they are never going to love me and i say , that doesn t matter what matters is that you feel and express your need in that need lies a world of pain we can use the left brain to rationalize , i don t need it or them , but alas , the need remains unabated it drives so much later behavior so we rationalize with one brain while the other is hurting terribly it does matter whether they can love you or not because that never changes the need that need tells the truth of our lives , or our history we do not want to cover over that history in it lies liberation for unfulfilled need means pain why ? because we are being warned that something essential to life and survival is missing the trouble is that it becomes an imprint that dogs us for a lifetime we are on constant alert , agitated and stimulated by that need no matter how much we try to relax if we successfully repress it , the tension in our muscle system can lead to all kinds of maladies or we just ache all of the time if we never get to the right brain and the deep brain we will never get to need it is covered over by the hyperactivity of the left prefrontal brain we need to find a way to bypass that verbal , intellectual , rationalizing brain and get back to our nature our feelings , which are our nature those who are distant from that nature cannot value our environment , or animals , or anything that belongs to nature first they have to feel what is inside of them not an easy task worse , when they chose a therapy they often chose one that also bypasses nature and flees to the safety of the intellect ay ay ay it is interesting about the right and left brain a new study found that those humans with left brain injury became more creative new scientist dec , that is , they seemed to have more access to the right brain and feelings after all , it is feelings that allow an overview , an ability to make the connection among facts the left brain seems more point by point , punctilious seeing each fact as an entity onto itself feelings seem to be more global and provide a deeper understanding of events what the study seems to show is that the left brain can smother creativity , and of course , feelings language is wonderful and terrible the more intellectual , the worse you are , as odd as they may seem and yet , where would we be without einstein he was certainly creative yet he never got onto the heisenberg theory it is just that intellectuality in the social sciences seems to be deadly how else to explain the lack of interest in a feeling therapy ?
