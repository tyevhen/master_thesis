the following post comes from my friend bill from hope and healing dynamics being on his own journey , seeking peace of mind , he has much to offer and i so love what he has to say you can see he has a button on the right sidebar freedom ! from panic and anxiety that will take you directly to his site if you come back later and ca n't find this post thanks so much bill for sharing your ah hah ! moment with us in the midst of desperation , have you ever exclaimed either of these to yourself or someone else ? i just want to be the way i used to be ! i want to be my old self again ! i know i sure have and they re probably the most common verbal expressions of pain and frustration i hear from anxiety and mood disordered clients actually , the whole concept makes perfect sense , doesn t it ? i mean , who wouldn t want to return to a time of identity and comfort when all is unhinged , barren , and cold well , some six years ago something occurred quite unexpectedly that awakened me from futile dreams of the past i had been in the throws of anxiety , depression , and desperation subsequent to some very distressing family situations six months prior and instead of working toward a valid peace grounded in the present , i became obsessed with rekindling an internal fire that had been fueled by wishes and myths yes , i was grasping at what i believed to be the most accessible measure of familiarity and stability and it made perfect sense to adopt the watchword , i just want to be the way i used to be but , out of nowhere , something occurred that would forever change my perspective okay , so there i was , one taut mass of mind and flesh pacing around my apartment on a steamy summer afternoon and in the midst of all the agitation a quotation from , of all things , the bible pervaded my being now , i was raised in a christian home however , i was not a christian at the time , nor am i now nonetheless , a scene from the book of luke , chapter became a part of me you may know the story it seems mary magdalene , mary the mother of james , and a woman named joanna went to jesus tomb with spices for his body well , when they got there the stone at the entrance to the tomb had been rolled away and the body was gone needless to say , they were puzzled and frightened and as they pondered what they d seen , two men appeared to them , posing this amazing question why do you look for the living among the dead ? bam ! the power of the query struck me like a bolt of lightening right between the eyes and i immediately turned inward , asking , bill , just why are you looking for the living among the dead ? the truth of the matter was , what i d been looking for no longer existed and hadn t for decades , if ever so , with the introduction of that huge dose of reality , why would i choose to waste my time desperately pleading for history ? wow , the inquiry was that powerful ! if you can relate to any portion of my quest for comfort , i m going to suggest that you ask yourself what i now call the question of the angels the next time you re in the abyss of struggle and desperation i mean , don t you think it has the power to trump our natural inclination to rummage through a million yesterdays in the quest for relief in the immediate ? now , don t misunderstand the past is significant , forming so much of who we are today however , it s only relevant within the context of how we became who we are , a reference for decision making , and the sweetness of reminiscence yes , there s just no way we ll ever live and grow , today , if we re planted in depleted soil does any of this make sense to you ? well , don t short circuit your mind just now , trying to make perfect sense of it just swirl it around for the next day or so and see what comes together however , in the end , i believe adopting this personal philosophy will open so many doors for you please , ask yourself why am i looking for the living among the dead ? do n't forget to sign up for the giveaway ! if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like why me ? having the faith to endure the hard times endure it well keeping the focus on others linkwithin
