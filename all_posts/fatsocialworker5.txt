lately , i 've been getting up at , what feels like to me , the ass crack of dawn pardon my french yesterday i had class on a saturday ! my bff made a joke about it , what , do social workers consider all days equal or something ? today i have training for my part time , terrible , depressing , seasonal retail job i 've also been spending my weekend evenings out with friends , being social , and even imbibing a bit this makes waking up at a decent hour like am today or am yesterday seem like a huge effort and admittedly , i probably should n't be out so late am on friday night , am last night it 's just difficult to find the right balance i do n't get a straight up to schedule or even a straight up to schedule things are unpredictable and it 's hard to plan for a good time out if i want to conserve sleep and i know how important sleep is in fact , i am struggling getting these very words out this morning , and i'm sure someone is going to read this and assume i am drunk , because i am questioning that possibility myself right now it 's just something i 've felt okay about sacrificing the past couple of days in exchange for fun i ca n't wait for the days when i do n't have to choose those days do eventually show up , right ? right ? this is just one example of how crappy my notes from class were yesterday pretty sure i was falling asleep as i was trying to write them i tried to pull the whole face away from professor and pretend you 're looking down at your notes when your eyes are closed but then your whole body jolts when you actually fall asleep making it obvious that you were sleeping thing if you actually know what hypoprolacti mema ? means , please advise
