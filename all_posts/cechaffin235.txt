i think the objectification of the self as a patient under treatment qualifies as outside , though the narrator may be biased since i was begun on a new antidepressant last wednesday i have n't cried , and have felt better in general until this afternoon , when i began to feel fragile this makes me suspect i should increase the dose of the antidepressant now lest i lose the effect , as i have so many times oh , and i just remembered i forgot one medication this morning abilify ! that 's not good , as one test of my sanity is remembering all the medications i am supposed to pour down my gullet it 's no secret and no shame , here lithium , effexor , prozac , wellbutrin , abilify , adderall , enalapril , aspirin , celebrex and m s contin on bad back days klonopin at bedtime of course i am transitioning from prozac and wellbutrin to effexor , the new antidepressant , why i am on three at present i 'll stop the prozac and wellbutrin on wednesday i used to say to my patients that if they took no more than one pill per decade they could be considered healthy by that criteria i ca n't be healthy , as i take two pills per decade still , an increase in medications also reflects a doctor 's inability to properly treat a disease doctors always add more in pursuit of the desired effect , whether it 's to control seizures or blood pressure but what is mood ? and what are its normal variations ? and are some destined to be lifelong melancholics like eeyor ? flowers for algernon you begin to come out of a depression and smell the roses when inexplicably , the normal mood retreats and you 're left alone again in the shoddy outhouse of your mind this is what i fear will happen to my effexor response what must it be like for a person who 's never seen a psychiatrist to read my blog ? monsanto coined the term , better living through chemistry i can see a suspicion that people like myself just ca n't handle a little pain in their lives , and thus go running to the doctor for every little anxiety and mood shift but it 's not like that i did n't see a psychiatrist until i was , though i had suffered severe depressions since the age of i had decided it was simply normal to be suicidal for six months at a time , that everyone must go through it i do n't expect psychiatry to help me with grief over my daughter 's death , or to give me the courage to take my former landlord to small claims court which i'm doing i just want to be normal , with normal sadness and anger and fear , the kind we all have what makes me abnormal is my brain 's ability to generate a persistent mood , whether the pit of depression or the peak of mania , for an extended time , a time long enough to damage my life and relationships for a mood disorder to be worth treating , it must interfere with basic functioning it must harm one 's life how i do go on ! so much for today 's confessional i 'll end with a poem on depression , another objectification on the left brain sometimes i think my left hemisphere swollen like some great infected testicle , necrotic , convoluted and gray its vein walls are thinner than the membranes lizards use to shield their eyes and inside blood flows so slowly i consider it a miracle that a single rational thought escapes the great vein of galen sits at the bottom of both hemispheres like a distensible sewer line that eventually empties through the superior vena cava into the heart s right chamber where its effluent mixes with blood from the bowels and extremities , pools in the lungs , and , re oxygenated , races from the left ventricle back to everywhere else i tell you this because the dream engine that pulls the body has no conception of itself , and though dependent on blood is blind as an infected testicle , as my metaphors bear witness and your brain understands not rated , ce
