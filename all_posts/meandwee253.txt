hi friends ! i 've totally abandoned this space , it seems sigh well , we 've been enjoying the summer in these parts ! we got a membership at a local pool so that paige can go and splash around to her heart 's content and the rest of the time has been spent in her therapies or going to playdates or running errands and playing the time just seems to fly and get away from me ! in case you missed it , i added an update to my last post about my toy reduction experiment you 'll see it went well and is something i plan to continue for children with sensory processing issues , it seems to help the overwhelm factor to a minimum love it ! onto what 's on my mind when i noticed i had n't written in a while , i took some time to think about why that is aside from being generally busy and too tired to make it a priority , i think it also has to do with the fact that i 've been struggling to figure out what my writing voice should be here i want to sound like myself here , but also do n't want to offend people i want to inspire and uplift and not turn anyone off but , at the same time , i like to joke around , swear , and complain in a funny way about things i have found that i censor myself all the time and i end up feeling like this blog does n't always feel like mine sometimes it does , sometimes it does n't i want to come to this space and say things the way i think them and stop trying to make it sound like someone else wrote it do you know what i mean ? i ca n't keep trying to please everyone i 'd like to start making it markedly my own and add the candid silliness that i crave it 's my creative outlet , after all so , that 's what i'm gonna do sound like a plan ? ok , that said , i will be back here soon hopefully the posts will be more frequent and more me save you might also like stay at home mom fashion and style in progress mother 's day and the birth linkwithin
