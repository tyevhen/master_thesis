thanks to oregon , another diet and dementia study hit the press or internet prior to last week a modest number of seniors were tested for levels of all sorts of vitamins and fatty acids , given cognitive testing , and then some had mris as well the punch line is that those seniors with the highest levels of b vitamins b , b , b , b , and folate and vitamins c , d , and e had the best scores on cognitive function and some mighty fine lookin' brains those with high omega marine fatty acids also did well the cohort with high trans fats did poorly exactly what we might expect ! imagine that what we eat might impact the brain after all the seniors tested were all white , educated oregonians who joined an aging cohort study back in healthy older folks agreed to be poked , prodded , questioned , imaged , and measured until their deaths at the time of this study , circa , subjects were left , with an average age of , female the population was originally chosen to be healthy , and after years those that remained were pretty healthy , with a relatively low amount of comorbid illness such as high blood pressure only were apoe carriers only had b deficiency pg ml and were oh vitamin d deficient ng ml meaning that as a whole , the population was pretty well stocked up on vitamins eating well is exactly what i would expect from a bunch of older , educated oregonians the weaknesses of the study are the small number and the lack of ethnic or socioeconomic diversity and the observational nature the strength is that multiple nutrients were measured via blood tests rather than relying on the more classic and classically unreliable food frequency questionnaires ffqs the multiple nutrients were then statistically arranged into certain nutrient patterns on one hand , this makes it easier to apply the results to real life diets , as people eat food , not isolated nutrients on the other hand , this type of statistical manipulation can lend itself to data mining with imaging , various memory and cognitive tests , plasma biomarkers and biomarker patterns for example , the b , c , d , e vitamins , marine omegas , omega retinol , lutein hdl , saturated fat , trans fat mostly linolelaidic acid omegat , carotenoids , etc there were quite a lot of associations to be had the most interesting are the previously mentioned generally better global findings in the bcde group and the omega group , and the generally worse findings in the trans fat group in addition , folks in the lutein hdl group had better memory , and those in the omega retinol group had poorer memory and language scores in adjusting for comorbid factors , age , education , gender , apoe status , and other health factors did n't seem to impact these findings that much the only major link between health problems and nutrients was a link between hypertension and trans fats and low b vitamins , which makes physiologic sense remember , lousy b vitamin status leads to high homocysteine , which is likely a cause of hypertension interestingly , if the study subject had depression , the link between omega status and white matter density in the brain was lost in subjects without depression , there was a significant link between omega levels and a healthier white matter density compared to whole brain volume so when the researchers broke it all down , they found that age , gender , apoe status , education years , hypertension and depression accounted for of the variation in cognitive scores , and the nutrient status was responsible for an additional they found nutrient status to account for of the total brain volume and of the white matter density compared to whole brain volume variation what , then , would constitute the supposed diet of the healthiest brains ? dark leafy green and cruciferous vegetables , fruits , and fish were on the good side , bakery foods such as cookies , pies , doughnuts , fried foods , margarine , red meat , and offal were on the trans fat side red meat and offal seemed to be added to this group due to the previous dietary pattern study done in manhattan implicating offal consumption in worsening cognitive status chris masterjohn had something to say about that study here when holism goes horribly wrong the perils of dietary pattern analysis will give you a clue as to his thoughts ! there are , indeed , trans fats in red meat and offal , but they tend to be cla the isomers implicated in this newest study are the baked goods margarine variety of trans fats as you know , red meat and offal are fantastic sources of b vitamins the mechanisms by which the specific nutrients may be helpful or harmful are ones we have discussed many times on this blog the b vitamins are necessary for proper functioning of the folate cycle , which has all sorts of downstream effects with relation to neurotransmitters , oxidative stress , inflammation , etc i 've also discussed vitamin d a number of times , and while i have n't covered much on vitamin e or c , i suppose i should get to that omegas have also been reviewed at length trans fats , on the other hand , may well replace omegas in the cell membranes , and are associated with systemic inflammation , cardiovascular disease , and endothelial dysfunction all those processes could have an impact on memory , brain structure , and cognition to break it down , eat real food , not cookies and doughnuts how hard is that ?
