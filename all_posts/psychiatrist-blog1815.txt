in my post below , things i wish i knew , i talked about how i'm uncomfortable with uncertainty , in particular when i'm the one to make decisions for other people and do n't really have any way to know the full consequences of the decisions i make for them i mentioned a number of things i wish i knew , most did n't draw much attention , but two topics did the consequences of allowing children to watch video games , and the issue of prescribing novel antipsychotic medications off label , as opposed to xanax enough about videokid spring sports have begun and he 'll have gobs of homework as the school year ends , he 's looking for a job , thinking about college , learning to drive , it 's soon to be a moot point we 're doing our best here and it 's an imperfect world , what can i say instead , i 'll tell you why i'm more comfortable prescribing a very low dose of a second generation anti psychotic usually either mg of seroquel or my of zyprexa off label when someone is subjectively distressed let me call it agitated , it 's hard for me to say because i'm not inside their skin often these are folks who have bipolar disorder or have an agitated major depression , and the dose of the antipsychotic is given on an as needed basis determined by the patient until something else kicks in i do n't think i 've ever given this as the sole agent unless the patient has simply refused other medications to put it simply , i give these medications instead of xanax because they are easy to stop no one gets stuck on them , no one makes me uncomfortable by demanding that i continue to prescribe something that is no longer needed people take them when needed usually a handful of times , or a few times a week xanax helps , and people take it a few times a day , maybe it helps so much they take it a few times every day , maybe it helps so much they take it a more than i suggested , and they do n't want to stop , and if i refuse to continue to write for it they become demanding , or call repeatedly in distress insisting i must give them something , and i'm faced with the issue of refusing to write for it and risking that they 'll withdraw and possibly seize , or writing for a medication on on going basis that i'm not comfortable with , sometimes after it 's been escalated to doses where i wonder if the fda will hunt me down this just does n't happen with low dose anti psychotics okay , in reality , i never use xanax , so this has only been an issue when seeing patients that other docs have started and maintained someone on up to mg a day , chronically , ouch ! but if the same patient as above shows up and there is no reason not to , i may use ativan lorezepam or klonopin clonazepam in the same way i agree , if they can be used in the short term , and if someone does n't become addicted to them or physically dependent or tolerant , the risks are less so , i weigh it in my head is there a history of addiction ? yes no benzos is there a history of or current alcohol abuse punt does the patient get distressed when i tell them they ca n't drink on this medicine ? if there is no history of alcohol or benzodiazepine abuse or dependence they are cross reactive , if the patient has been on a benzodiazepine before and had no trouble coming off , if they drink sometimes but have no history of alcohol abuse , then i feel comfortable prescribing a benzodiazapine i give a small amount , and i tell them it 's a crisis medication , not for regular use i warn that it can be sedating , that it can be addicting most people worry about that it 's a good sign it 's the person who assures me that he wo n't get addicted that i worry about when i use a novel anti psychotic , i tell the patient that it is a low dose and that the medication is associated with precipitating fast forwarding the onset of diabetes , lipid dysregulation , and weight gain i suggest they take it only when needed and that they stop as soon as possible there is no withdrawal to low doses one of our commenters said that even low doses cause difficulties , even kill i assume this means weight gain , diabetes , dyslipidemia this may be , but in my personal experience , i have not seen problems with periodic low dose medication maybe i 've simply been lucky to date i do n't insist that anyone take any medication they do n't want to take nor do i recruit patients , i'm an outpatient doc , people come to me , often asking for medication i have never said to a patient if you wo n't take this medication , i wo n't treat you i tell them what the studies show , i tell them what i think they should do , if they do n't want meds and they still feel helped by coming to see me , i see them we live in a society that values the right to make choices , even bad choices we allow people to smoke and to drink alcohol , despite the fact that the risks they expose themselves and others to are both huge and certain , the cost to society exorbitant it is unfortunate , perhaps even tragic , that we do n't have medications with no side effects or ugly adverse effects and i wish that were n't so , it would make my job so much easier but given the options we have , when i see someone in distress , i'm faced with what i know and that is full of uncertainty will this medicine make you sick ? will you have a recurrence of your illness without it ? will you have a recurrence anyway and get sick if you take it ? given that there is no free ride , the other option is to refuse to prescribe , and that carries with it lots of other risks , the denial of something that often helps , and the message of there is no hope if you ca n't be patient and honestly , therapy alone , even great therapy , does n't always do it mostly , i'm left to share what i know with the patient including statistics if i have them and if it 's appropriate but ultimately the decision belongs to the patient , and when they leave it to me , i cross my fingers and do my best so no one wanted to comment on the rise in teenage suicide following the black box warning ?
