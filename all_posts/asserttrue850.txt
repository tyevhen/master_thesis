the other day , i happened upon a long list of css editors , arranged chronologically newest tools first i have n't tried any of them except stylizer , which beware lays down the net framework as part of its install process allow minutes stylizer has a really beautiful ui but is far from being the point and click wysiwyg stylesheet designer i 've been looking for it 's really just an editor you do a lot of typing although i must say , stylizer beats the living crap out of most other free or crippled down eval version css editors i 've seen , which all tend to look like this unfortunate travesty does anybody else see the irony in the fact that most css editors are unbelievably fugly ? i mean , if anything cries out for a decent visual design tool with eye pleasing widgets , it would have to be a css editor but most css tools at the freeware level , anyway look like they were designed by eclipse programmers on bad acid i guess this is the ultimate example of programmers not knowing how to design user interfaces , and design experts not knowing how to program maybe it 's no wonder of css editors look like notepad in a piece suit
