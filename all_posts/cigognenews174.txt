i have been going on about my therapy for years that it is the cure so what does that mean ? i have always been warned not to use the word prove , cause nothing is proved in science it is supported , confirmed , strengthened but never proved so why do i go on with the word ? therein lies the rub because first , let me lay out what i mean i will use the example of psychosis to explain over decades as patients descend down into and back to their early past they begin to lose articulation and have trouble forming sentences it means they are still on the emotional right level with twinges of left brain verbal skills which begin to diminish as they go back more they lose their capacity for words and if they should use complicated words to describe their feelings it is a false primal why ? because the more remote the primal trip the less capacity for words there is a two year old does not have the capacity for sophisticated language if it is a true reliving it would be impossible and usually is mind you , this is after a long time in therapy and after many lesser pains are experienced as the patient begins to drop into gestational life there is more pain than one can imagine , soon , it is a pain that does not hurt inside because it becomes a feeling that is being felt it looks like pain but it is a manageable one , unless the patient is led or forced into the emotional depths where experience is premature and out of the question here , during this period where the brainstem reigns the pains are the most acute and they can be psychotic making how do we know ? some patients who have come to us from rebirthing therapy plunge down deep too early and begin delusions and hallucinations i see the cosmos and shining angels , etc the pain has mounted into the neo cortex and drove it to manufacture defenses , including false perceptions and bizarre ideas it is a sure sign of overload and inundation of pain down on this level , as the patient , over time , goes deeper into the past , the pain mounts , which is how we know where the deepest pain lies we see it and measure it no guesswork and when we see it over and over in hundreds of patients over years we begin to get a good idea of our observations it is consistent and replicable it is not longer a theory but a precise observation which i call cure why ? because when there are such deep experiences , always nonverbal , so much changes the biology , the appearance , the feelings , the look and the sense of comfort , at last to say nothing of possibly diverting serious imprints from exacerbating into serious illness later on gone are the migraines and high blood pressure and gone is a good deal of the compulsive acting out , not the least of which is sex so here we see the dialectic interplay between memory , deep imprints , the pain and the symptoms it engenders it avoids guesswork they all converge into a feeling it is a unified event we are not working on this symptom or that we are working on the whole system as it responds to the deepest and most devastating imprints feeling them then radiates everywhere in the system so that the effects are systemic effects throughout the system we are not looking to conform a private theory we are developing a theory out of our observations experience first , deep brain observations first , then the theory and the hypotheses the patients experiences do not confirm the theory or the hypothesis , it is the theory that goes or changes or modifies i have no desire to hang onto some concocted theory that i adore if it does not make the patient better then why hang onto it ? this is largely what happened to all those therapists who wanted to improve on our theory they added drugs to the mix , then hypnosis , then cognitive and so on ad nauseam all because they never saw the central truth of feeling and , i assume , because they never underwent their own feelings
