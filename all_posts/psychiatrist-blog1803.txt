ok , i'm not one to care about celebrity gossip and that 's not the point of this post i just saw this on cnn and it just struck me how far we still have to go about educating the general public about psychiatric issues it would help if the media at least would get it right here 's a quote from the cnn coverage of anna nicole smith 's autopsy findings his death was ruled an accidental overdose of three antidepressant medications methadone , lexapro and zoloft , according to forensic pathologist cyril wecht , who performed a private autopsy at the request of his mother ouch when did methadone become an antidepressant ? and how will pp reimburse for that ?
