living with kennedy 's disease provides its own set of challenges i have also found that the older i get , the more i need to keep moving if i don t , i stiffen up real quick once that happens , it becomes even more difficult to move for some reason my wheelchair causes me the most problems if i sit for more than a couple of hours in my chair , i find it difficult to move when i first stand road trips really cause me problems because i am sitting behind the wheel for a few hours and then sitting some more in the chair because of this , i make it a point to move every two hours the movement might be as simple as just standing next to a counter and walking in place or , if i can safely stand and reach for something , i do it the best thing i ever did was install a grab bar in the bathroom by the commode besides using it to help me stand up , it is where i do my standing exercises every morning and , whenever i go to the bathroom each day , i use the bar to perform steps in place because of these routines , i end up doing several simple and quick exercises throughout the day it has made all the difference in the world in regards to feeling better and stronger i encourage you to develop your own routines to help keep you more mobile your joints and muscles more flexible your blood pumping and your heart stronger your lungs functioning at a higher capacity feeling better and more engaged as always , before beginning any exercise program , please consult with your doctor
