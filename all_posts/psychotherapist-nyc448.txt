anger is a common emotional response , especially when someone close to us says or does something that is hurtful holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die but anger becomes toxic when we hold onto it and refuse to let it go we keep the anger alive by going over and over in our minds whatever grievance we have with a particular person , and this becomes an emotionally and sometimes physically toxic experience there is much wisdom in the buddhist saying , holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die holding onto anger is mostly hurtful to ourselves it can sour our outlook on life as well as current and future relationships letting go of anger is a process letting go of anger is a process it 's important to acknowledge the anger rather than sweeping it under the rug but , beyond this initial stage , it 's important to work through the anger so that it does n't ruin our emotional well being and our relationships letting go of anger is a process sometimes people hold onto anger because they 're afraid to deal with their underlying hurt feelings feeling angry , as opposed to feeling hurt , gives the illusion of feeling empowered but , in many ways , holding onto anger is disempowering it takes a lot of energy to keep churning anger , and it takes away from other positive areas in our lives letting go of anger and forgiving is n't the same as forgetting whether or not you forgive the person who offended you is up to you as i 've said many times in other blog articles , forgiveness does n't mean that you 're saying whatever happened was all right it means that you 've made a decision to let go of the hurt and anger you feel when you 're ready to do so it also means you 're ready to move on , whether you decide to keep this person in your life or not when you forgive someone , it does n't mean that you necessarily forget what happened , especially if whatever caused you to feel hurt or angry is part of an ongoing pattern with this person it also does n't mean that you remain in an unhealthy relationship but remembering and keeping yourself out of harm 's way does n't mean you have to hold onto the negative emotions when holding onto anger becomes habitual , it can make you feel bitter about your life collecting grievances and holding onto them puts an emotional barrier between you and others for many people , this is a way to shield themselves from getting hurt again but using this defense mechanism comes at a big emotional and sometimes physical cost if you find yourself holding onto anger , you can ask yourself the following questions what purpose does it serve to hold onto this anger ?
