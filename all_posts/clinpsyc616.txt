granted , the study was conducted on rats , but still marijuana has strong anti inflammatory effects , and many researchers believe that there is a compelling link between chronic inflammation and the progression of alzheimer 's , said gary wenk , a study co author and a professor of psychology at ohio state university inflammation in the brain is part of aging , wenk said it happens to almost all of us as we age but in some cases , this inflammation gets out of hand and causes serious damage treatment with a synthetic compound similar to marijuana reduced inflammation in older rats in addition to making the animals smarter , said wenk , who is also a professor of neuroscience and molecular virology , immunology and medical genetics the compound substantially improved the memories of the older rats , he said these animals were able to hold on to key details of a specific task untreated older rats , on the other hand , were not the researchers presented their findings october in atlanta at the annual society for neuroscience meeting evidence suggests that people who regularly smoked marijuana in the s and s rarely develop alzheimer 's disease , said wenk , adding that researchers are eager to develop a drug with the anti inflammatory properties of marijuana , but without the drug 's psychoactive effects the compound significantly improved the older rats' memories , wenk said they found the platform faster , suggesting that they were less apt to forget key information for this task it 's a pretty good prediction of how a human would respond to this drug younger rats treated with the compound found the escape platform faster than non treated younger rats did however , the difference was n't as remarkable as that of the older group , possibly due to the lack of age related changes in the brains of the younger rats older rats have impaired spatial memory , due to the effect of aging on the brain , wenk said wenk conducted this work with ohio state colleagues yannick marchalant and francesca cerbai , both postdoctoral researchers in psychology , and holly brothers , a graduate student in psychology my view hey , the effects ca n't be much less than current so called memory enhancing drugs ! smoke 'em if you got 'em ? ? link to full story here
