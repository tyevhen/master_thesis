according to a recent post on cnn com , workers would give up their morning coffee to surf the 'net what i 'd like to know is how these people can be awake enough to find their computers ok , i 'll relate this post to psychiatry somehow fortunately , i had a link set aside on my browser bar for just such a moment it 's an old post , but a goodie what de institutionalization means to jane joe public this is a post for those of you who struggle to support loved ones with mental illness or wonder what it 's like having a mentally ill family member also , tune in for mike wallace 's last day on the air on minutes this sunday both he and his wife have publically discussed his struggle with depression meanwhile , given our recent discussion of the angry patient , i thought i 'd link to a recent study published in the american journal of cardiology this study suggests that people who tend to experience negative emotions and to inhibit the expression of these emotions in social interactions are at increased risk of adverse cardiac events the study refers to a type d personality , although i'm at a loss to know how they validated their type d personality scale i think this finding is more likely explained by the known relationship between clinical depression and cardiovascular disease see , i did become relevant eventually
