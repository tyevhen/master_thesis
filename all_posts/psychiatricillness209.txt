poppy is settling in well , i was a little worried about her at first as she did not eat , drink , poo or wee for over hours she seems reasonably happy now and she has even ate all her dinner tonight i played football at lunch time , i nearly scored but my brain did not tel my feet what to do quickly enough and i lost the ball my defence was ok again but i got hit in the face quite hard with the ball it blocked a goal though ! my department is through to the play off for the semi finals tomorrow is the play off and if we get through we will be playing a second game straight after for the first game i will be a sub , and going on to give the others a break to get water etc for the second game we will be a player down so i will have to stay on the pitch for the whole game i am really enjoying it though o i spoke to the girl who arranges the training as i have not yet been she said it keeps getting cancelled because everyone is on holiday but we should get a practice in soon my training for the sport relief mile is going well last friday i did the mile in mins and secs on the treadmill i bought a stop watch at the weekend and i have been running what i think is an approximate mile in the park every day after work as it is all up and down and a lot harder my time have been as follows monday tuesday wednesday if i manage to do the mile in less than minutes i will be really pleased with myself , less than i will be well chuffed under i would be satisfied but over mins i would be disapointed i 'll update this post with my time for tomorrow , i have not decided whether i will run or rest on friday but it will definately be lots of carbohydrates for dinner on friday i have also lost a couple of pounds this week which is a nice bonus ! ! ! o
