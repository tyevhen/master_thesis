a patient who never wants to discuss her life but sinks immediately into her past will abreact and not get well and when we observe a person s history we are also witnessing ancient history at the same time a patient who cries like a newborn can never duplicate that sound after a primal one way we know this is in observing a patient make motions during reliving birth , and cannot duplicate that movement later on , no matter how hard she tries too often we see abreaction in patients who start in the present , begin a feeling and then immediately skip steps and goes to some kind of birth trauma that kind of reliving becomes a defense it interrupts and does not enhance connection in dialectical fashion we descend to deep unconscious levels and immediately become conscious on that level the unconscious is transformed into consciousness this means that we will no longer be driven by those specific unconscious forces we have access to our inner states we thereafter will not suffer from such things as a bleeding ulcer or colitis without being aware of it chances are , however , that we won t suffer from such afflictions each lower level of brain function is designed to keep us alive we can use lower levels to modify higher ones but it does not work in reverse imagine if that were possible the higher level neocortex could permanently modify brainstem functions ? but we survive because it cannot thus feelings can certainly sway ideas but ideas can only suppress feelings , not eradicate them we see in our therapy how physiology and limbic feelings directly affect ideas and beliefs a very rapid heart rate can push someone to go and do , yet no matter how hard we try we often cannot alter the heart rate , especially the rate that is accompanied by anxiety that is why we cannot will a slower heart rate over time or consciously drive away anxiety ideas are hundreds of millions years away from physiological and emotional functions i remember seeing a patient who had just started therapy who told me that since he forgave his parents he feels much better proof that ideas can trump feeling yet when he was measured his stress hormone levels cortisol never changed thus the neo cortex can trump what we think are feelings without ever touching feelings , per se the neo cortex is most adept at deceiving itself it can produce the thought of being well without really being well ideas here function as anesthetics in therapy we certainly don t want to being anesthetized in order to get well the brain is a complex proposition and to stay on any one level in therapy to the exclusion of the others means that any progress made in therapy is partial to do reprogramming of the brain to achieve so called normal brainwaves biofeedback is deficient and cannot lead to cure when we wonder if we should call a therapy scientific we have only to ask , does it elucidate and clarify the properties of nature ? we do not ask if it works because that is subjective and not always accurate it is the difference between asking a scientific question and one that requires a moral perspective alone do we know more about humanity in this therapy or are we only after some sort of pragmatic , mechanical solution ? are we doing deep breathing or matching brainwaves to some ideal ? here the focus is on the technique , not the patient nor evolution a major difference when we focus on how the patient evolves we learn when we decide on how we treat her beforehand we don t in short , can we learn from this therapy how to treat other human beings in psychotherapy ? it is not a matter of defying evolution , but of harnessing it for the good of mankind that is darwin s legacy
