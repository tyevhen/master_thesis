speaking of livers so camel and camelman went out to dinner the other night they 're sitting alone eating their dinner in peace because camelchild is off at a national oratory competition where she 's leaving the rest of those orating children behind in the dust the waiter brings them drinks and declares they 've been sent over as compliments of another couple in the restaurant camel looks around and sees one of her patients how nice ? how awkward camel called me from the restaurant what should she do ? it 's not really a question , it 's more of an i need to tell this to someone moment camelman wants to buy the other couple drinks back camelman is not a physician or mental health professional camel knows the sender of the drink , sitting there with his own , is an alcoholic , but even if he were n't , she still would feel uncomfortable reciprocating what to do ? thank the patient and move on ? sometimes this is the only thing to do tell the patient she ca n't accept this , and risk that the patient will feel rejected , or start a whole back and forth i insist scene ? quietly tell the waiter to transfer the charge to their bill , hope it happens as quietly as intended and the patient does n't leave feeling insulted ? perhaps there is no perfect answer generally , though , shrinks hate it when this happens happy memorial day weekend clinkshrink is playing scrabble with her family this i know because she sent me a cellphone pic followed by an email asking for words with u 's roy is doing yardwork and thinking about ducks and i will be cooking dinner tonight for camel and camelman it 's not too late to observe national duckling month ! double billing will continue on tuesday and hi to elise i 've just learned that my mother in law reads shrink rap
