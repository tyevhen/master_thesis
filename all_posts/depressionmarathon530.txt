i do n't know about you , but being sick challenges my mood stability i am still battling some sort of virus my throat soreness did n't stop until yesterday , but today everything seems to have moved south into my chest i 've got a nasty bark of a cough i'm worn out i just got up from a hour nap , and i have n't done a damn thing to warrant such fatigue this is when my mood starts to slip i do n't like convalescing so i can tolerate it for a couple days sometimes it 's even a nice little break but we 're going on a week now , and i'm getting a little tired of this so far my mood has held up , but being sick , especially for this long , certainly challenges it i'm keeping close tabs on it paying attention , that 's about all i can do for now i do n't want the darkness sneaking up on me i certainly hope i start feeling physically better soon since i 've been sick , i have little else to report i did feel well enough on thursday to go for a short , easy run it was so gorgeous outside , i was just itching to go , and i felt good while out there but maybe that was a mistake , because i seem to have felt physically worse since then work has been slowly getting a little less stressful i still feel overwhelmed every time i get a new patient , but i 've been working my way through it i had a hour training class yesterday , which will help me feel a little less stressed with the techniques i learned i expect things will continue to improve i just wish the whole process would proceed a bit more quickly proceeding more quickly that seems to be the theme of this post i want to feel physically better sooner rather than later i want to feel less overwhelmed at work as soon as possible i'm apparently not thrilled with god 's time frame right now i guess that means i need to work on acceptance pushing back against god 's time wo n't get me anywhere i know that so i guess i 'll be convalescing a bit longer and continuing to walk through the newness of my job as best i can and i 'll keep working on my acceptance
