hi friends ! a while back , i read this article in ny social diary about the home set up and philosophies of lisa mahar she 's the owner of kid o toy boutique , etc go take a gander if you 'd like as i'm about to discuss it here 's a picture of part of her childrens' play room from the article so organized and sleek , right ? as paige grows , i find that i am taking lots of time to think about how i want to set up the house to accomodate her needs especially now that she 's walking i'm also pondering how to teach her the things she needs to learn educational kinds of stuff i'm really trying to get to know her and what will work best for her the article i mention above is inspirational for me but not necessarily aspirational i like how she has pared the toy chaos down to just their favorites and has everything available for them i also like how she does n't just give them baby toys to play with , rather , actual materials that adults use i believe when children are ready they can rise to any occasion with a little guidance emphasis on when children are ready i also believe that children must have the chance to let their imaginations take flight and too much exposure to commercialization can cloud things a bit but , i also feel that she takes these ideals to the extreme and that 's fine for her i could n't go so far with all the ideals she discusses in the article i'm a little more live and let live about things when it comes to toys and household set up i'm a little more let kids be kids and if they want elmo then give it to them within reason of course some of the viewpoints expressed came off as judgmental , snobby , and rigid that said , i really respect and admire her resolve and that she cares so much about her family not enough people have thought any of these issues through to have a viewpoint good for her ! i found some nuggets of inspiration there in terms of organization of household clutter and chaos as well as future educational experiences what did you think of the article ? did it inspire you or turn you off ? for me it did a little of both in equal measure save you might also like time to enjoy simple ideas home inspiration linkwithin
