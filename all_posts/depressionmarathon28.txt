this morning i discovered somebody has been copying my blog posts en masse actually , i discovered it last week , but it really became clear this morning i have some tools connected to my blog which tell me when my content is being copied it also tells me which posts are being copied a few weeks ago , somebody copied all of january , then a few days later , somebody copied all of february , this morning i discovered they are now working on march , i assume it is the same person because in each case he or she accessed my content through a server in indonesia that 's what i know so far those of you who 've been reading for awhile know i 've been through this in the past that 's why i now have the detection tools in place unfortunately , i have not yet been able to pinpoint the exact person or site which is doing the copying but i'm working on it ! my concern is the mad copier , since he or she is likely in indonesia , may be re posting my material in another language there are plagiarism detector tools on the web , but i'm not sure if any of them have the capability to check for plagiarism in which the language has been changed and if this person is not re posting my material on their own blog , what the heck are they doing with it ? i'm irritated and concerned why is this person doing this ? obviously , they have some goal in mind , as they are copying every post from the very beginning of my blog why are they copying my thoughts , feelings , and words en masse ? i do n't know yet , but i am working to find out if any of you have experience with this , or are an internet savant , or know what steps i should take next , please let me know maybe together we can find the offender and put a stop to whatever it is he or she is planning to do with my material
