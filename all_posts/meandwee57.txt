this is the x version the newest art print i have for sale in my me wee etsy shop is quite sentimental to me i took quite a long time to plan the composition and colors for this painting and i'm pleased with how it turned out this is a contemporary mixed media collage blending my personal love for new england , nature , and nostalgia it 's specifically gouache paint and pencil i love studying family history and i often wonder what my own family members were like back in the days gone by this particular piece is based upon a family camp my great grandfather built at togus pond in augusta , maine generations have gone there to enjoy the cool waters and fun times with their families the girl in the picture is what i imagine my grandmother to have looked like at age in at the place i learned to swim as a child and enjoyed many happy times what was she thinking about ? what did she most enjoy ? what were her dreams ? what was she like as a friend ? my family and i were at this location when she passed away i was five years old perhaps the image is my way of paying tribute to a woman i did n't get to know well enough my way of inserting myself into her history it 's a curiosity i ca n't help but explore in my artwork these days all that aside , this is a piece of art that just looks darn cool filling a little blank nook in your family room , office , kitchen , hallway , or in a child 's nursery making a rustic chic statement this is the x version you may inquire about an x version at megan at meandwee com save save
