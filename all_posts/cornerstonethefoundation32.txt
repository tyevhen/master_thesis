one of the most delightful aspects of following christ is the joy and honour of being able to worship god the spiritual act of worshipping god is a way of life , where we offer our entire life to him by living in a holy manner that is pleasing to him there are also many outward expressions of worship available to us therefore , i urge you , brothers , in view of god 's mercy , to offer your bodies as living sacrifices , holy and pleasing to god this is your spiritual act of worship romans worship is recognising acknowledging declaring delighting in god s goodness holiness faithfulness love outwardly expressed though spending time with him while sitting at his feet thanking and praising him delighting our heart in him adoring him with songs of praise and worship writing , prayer , reading and meditating on his word living holy lives that are pleasing to god come , let us bow down in worship , let us kneel before the lord our maker for he is our god and we are the people of his pasture , the flock under his care psalm exalt the lord our god and worship at his footstool he is holy psalm worship the lord with gladness come before him with joyful songs psalm in a loud voice they sang worthy is the lamb , who was slain , to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise ! revelation it can be difficult to worship god when our lives are beset with troubles there have been times in my life when i said sadly , i don t feel like worshipping god right now however , to surrender ourselves to the act of worshipping god , even during our trials , is a liberating experience as by doing so , we are recognising god s sovereignty over all things and more , it is fulfilling our created function he created us to worship him selwyn hughes wrote , nothing is more important that the worship of the one who holds my life in his hands because he is god then i know that no matter how things might look to the contrary , all will be well thus my heart delights to worship him below is a worship poem that i wrote while still recovering from depression although i had struggled to consistently worship god during depression 's blackest phase , when he restored hope to my life , i once again abandoned myself to the pursuit of adoring and worshipping him with every fiber of my being who do i dream about ? at whose feet do i sit , while gazing adoringly into his face , as he sits upon his throne ? at whose feet i throw myself , so delighted to meet him face to face ? who is he who fellowships with me as i enter into his presence ? his name is jesus he is the desire of my heart in him do i truly delight earth has nothing that i desire besides him , and who do i have in heaven but him , the one who made all things he made me for himself i am his , and he is mine he made me to fellowship with him for all eternity and this is my deepest joy to be with him he is my obsession , my soul desire , my life and inspiration and as i lift my voice in praise , he meets me , for he is enthroned on the praises of his people and his love for me is unconditional he sees all of my inadequacies , failings , fears and inhibitions , and yet he loves me still he sees my mistakes , sin , weaknesses and imperfections , and yet he loves me still his name is indeed wonderful , for he is wonderful beyond words and regardless of how weak i am , he never tires of me , for his love is eternal he is the eternal father of love whom have i in heaven but you ? and earth has nothing i desire besides you psalm
