many people , who have a traumatic history , avoid coming to therapy because they fear being overwhelmed see my article starting psychotherapy it 's not unusual to feel anxious and ambivalent that 's why it 's so important for psychotherapists to help clients develop coping strategies while working on emotional trauma so that they can overcome their fears and do the therapeutic work without becoming overwhelmed developing coping strategies in therapy before working on trauma before any trauma work begins in therapy , a skilled therapist will help clients to develop the internal resources needed to do the work some clients , who engage in meditation , yoga or other mind body oriented practices , might already have some internal resources other clients , who might not know how to soothe themselves , will need help from a psychotherapist on how to develop these internal resources internal resources are an important part of preparing to do trauma work they allow the client to switch , if necessary , from disturbing memories of trauma to relaxing places within themselves to take a break before resuming the processing of the trauma knowing that they have a way to soothe themselves helps most clients to feel that the trauma work in therapy is manageable so they do n't approach the work with overwhelming fear unfortunately , many people who need help to overcome traumatic experiences do n't know that skilled trauma therapists facilitate the internal resourcing process , so they avoid coming to therapy because they 're too afraid of being overwhelmed if they do

experienced at the hands of his father as time went on , tom experienced an increasing disconnect between the happy facade that he managed to put on for friends and colleagues and his deep unhappiness
