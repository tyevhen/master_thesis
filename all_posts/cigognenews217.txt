dear arthur , a short message to wish you happy birthday and to tell you thank you for your work which has without any doubt pushed the understanding of human behavior forward everything is feeling and all you need is love to prevent you from trauma and neurosis later on i had the chance to come to the primal center from april to june to me primal therapy was the last chance , the end of the tunnel my only hope it changed my life forever and for the best and i wish to finish my therapy in the years to come i m now and i m saving money to come back in a bit since i came to primal therapy i feel i have a much better understanding of where i come from and why i have been acting the way i did for years i also know that parents do make mistakes and that you don t owe anything to them before i was living with a feeling of guilt to my mother because she has been depressed for years and i couldn t do anything now i understand that she is neurotic and there is not much i can do except talk to her about your therapy , your books and blog which is easier to understand for outsiders but also about the work of docteur leboyer which i think is very complementary to your work since primal therapy i met a girl and was able to have complete sexual intercourse which was impossible for me before i had like a blocage i have been with her for almost a year now and for the first time i am able to make plans about the future with a total stranger of course , there are days when things don t go so well and i m still not sure about the professional path i have chosen i might want to study psychology actually in the coming years but it is reassuring in my day to day life to know that every feeling has to be felt for what it is which means that to get better all you have to do is stop your activity go to a room or a place where you can be alone and cry and feel so to make things short thank you very much arthur you truly saved my life and i m sure the one of many and i look forward to meeting you when i ll come back to the center all the best and hello to david !
