sipping my coffee , sitting in my sweats , wiping sleep from my eyes , i'm awaiting the televised start of today 's new york city marathon i 'll watch the entire broadcast , amazed at the grace , skill , and prowess of the elite runners , but more so intrigued by the effort , will , and stories of those , like me , in the middle of the pack i'm feeling nostalgic and a little sad one year ago , i was there in the dark morning hours i boarded the bus from new york 's central library to staten island with other excited souls i milled around the athletes village , with , other runners , alternately waiting in line for a portable toilet , fetching myself something to eat and drink , chatting with other anxious runners , and resting on the ground and finally , i was there , in my starting corral with , hopping , stretching , whooping runners , waiting for the starting line to come into view and when it did , tears streamed down my face i had made it it was one year ago when i streamed across that iconic starting line in staten island three hours , minutes later , i joyously raced across the even more iconic finish line in central park , tired , spent , and oh , so proud i could n't contain my wide smile and tears last year on this day , i made that triumphant return to marathoning it was my first marathon in over years , a lifetime in my annals of running the achilles tear that took a year and a half to heal was behind me , and i was so , so happy i saw nothing but more triumphant running , which i no longer took for granted , in front of me it was a good day as i sit here today , despite the scary possibility i wo n't , i am feeling a bit more hopeful that i will one day repeat this experience and if possible , it may be even more emotionally charged i will go back to new york somehow , some way , some day , i will again stream across that starting line , whooping with joy , and race across that finish line with my fists in the air it will be the culmination of a long , long road i ca n't wait
