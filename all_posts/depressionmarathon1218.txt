river rafting ! who knew it could be this much fun ! wow ! i knew this was something i wanted to do , but it was n't really high on the bucket list it was one of those it would be cool if it happened , but i was n't planning to go out of my way to make it happen items two hours later , i was screaming , let 's do it again ! ! the rivers in northern colorado are at their highest level , and therefore running faster than they have in years ! we had to duck our heads to safely get under bridges ! it was incredible a total adrenaline rush i was almost bounced out of the raft once , and i was bounced on to the floor of it twice like i said , wow ! i was reading about mindfulness earlier if you need help focusing , meditating , or remaining mindful , i highly recommend a scenic ride down your nearest high water , fast flowing , roiling river i think you will find , as i did , little time to focus on anything other than the whitewater in your face of course you are free to seek a second opinion see you downstream
