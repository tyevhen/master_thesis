it 's refreshing and healthy , i think to see open , honest debate erupt over the usefulness of ioc frameworks , in particular the certifiably trendy spring framework i refer to bob lee 's gratifyingly blunt i do n't get spring surprisingly , most of the comments at the end of lee 's blog are dispassionate , logical , and in full agreement with lee 's premise , which to oversimplify is that spring is cryptic , over architected , and malodorous at a code level among other felonies , begging the question of why anyone would use it i can understand why lee would feel that way he 's right on most counts spring is indeed byzantine and heavy as most things surrounding jee are , and buries too many dependencies in xml but that does n't mean spring does n't have its legitimate uses
