i am a perfectionist some would see that as a valuable attribute , but it 's a curse i find faults everywhere , especially in myself and when i see myself as flawed and not good enough , i become extremely anxious so i'm redoubling my effort to love and accept myself that sounds kinda cheesy , but i have to do this my counselor says learning to authentically value myself including my flaws will help reduce my anxiety she asked me the other day to name three things i like about myself , and i struggled to come up with one when she asked me to name three things i do n't like about myself , it was hard to stop at three ! anxiety was at the top of that list yet if i truly accept myself , flaws and all , perhaps i 'll be less anxious going forward i need to discover what i like about myself , as this , instead of my supposed flaws , should be foremost in my mind
