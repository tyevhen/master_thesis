i think there 's a widespread confusion between two types of cause in psychology one cause has to do with precipitants , and is the sort we are interested in when we are trying to intervene in causal pathways the other cause has to do with character , with a pattern in which some particular example is situated , and is the sort we are interested in when we are trying to understand what it is that we are dealing with cbt models frequently muddle these together take the famous 'downward arrow' technique in cbt the idea is that we keep on interrogating a negative thought with a question like well , what 's so bad about that , what does it say about you ? and then we can get to the 'core beliefs' these are presented as deep rooted precipitants of lots of surface automatic thoughts , when they are better understood as the broadest possible meaning organiser of the thought in question for both types of cause , we can anticipate that , on the whole , the causes function as sine qua non 's yet here i think we need to be careful and this is because the 'ceteris' in the ceteris paribus explication of the causal necessity refers in each case not to causes in general , nor to the other type of cause , but only to causes of the same form that is to say when i say that the cause of a certain behaviour is a certain mental state , i am saying that in the present context it is not similarly a function or cause of another mental state also present this is not to say that a certain behaviour cannot be multiply causally determined , but only to say that the logic of the causal explanations necessitates the explicit ruling in of such multiple determinants which otherwise are simply ruled out by the explanation in question 's functioning as such and similarly for cause if i say that the man 's arm is shaking because of parkinsons , i am implying that it would not shake were it not for the parkinsons an arm may shake both because of parkinsons and because of anxiety depression i e if either were singularly removed we would still expect a tremor but that would need to be said when enumerating what the cause of something is we can talk about what a cause of a behaviour is , meaning a contributing cause , but this does not itself amount to a causal explanation of the behaviour unless it is wrapped up into a more complete story about what the cause s is are anyway , the limit of the sine qua non character of the causal story is i want to suggest that we ca n't rule that a particular behaviour or emotional state would not have been caused even if the cause we posit for it had not obtained the necessity of distinguishing causes is particularly potent in psychosomatic medicine by treating a physical symptom as a communication we are , i believe , saying something about its character we are not saying that it is caused by that which it communicates but we can also , i believe , view physical symptoms as effects of causes which happen to be psychological so i have a bad shock , and my body goes into cortisol or adrenaline or what have you production mode this then causes a physiological change in me , which may in turn cause a certain psychological state , etc etc psychotherapy typically works on the assumption that an investigation of meanings will result in a change of behaviour or emotion in order for this to work we must presume that self understanding involves a translation of an appreciation of causes into a reconfiguring of causes we guide our own activity according to our self understanding , and our agency is that meeting point of the two causes we come to realise that many of our behaviours and experiences do indeed conform to are caused by a certain pattern this allows us to think of alternatives , and to understand that we do indeed have a mind a perspective , and to guide our behaviour anew the behaviour now gives rise to different experiences , and our experience of the world is altered yet this is only one possible mechanism for therapy another version is contained in the kleinian idea that , in therapy , there is a direct communication from one unconscious to the other i believe that this commuincation is of a cause form at its worst , psychotherapy either degenerates psychodynamically into a search for merely possible causes of behaviour and feeling , or behaviourally into a search for precipitants causes of behaviours in the former case the patient is understood , or at least potentially understood , but a fat lot of good it does them in the latter case they are not even met as a person
