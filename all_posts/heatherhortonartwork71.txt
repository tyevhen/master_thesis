the kennicott glacier in wrangell st elias national park one must work and dare if one really wants to live van gogh this post is way overdue ! i seem to focus this blog on travel adventure and art happenings of note , however i have not traveled for a few months fortunately i have had time to complete more paintings and , most excitedly , made plans for new adventures in ! one particularly exciting piece of news to share is that i have i will be involved with the creation of two books in the next two years one will be a pictorial book about christopher mccandless and his year odyssey that he embarked on back in chris took many photographs on his journey and i have begun to do paintings based on some of these photographs , as well as a large painting of the belt that he crafted beautifully out of leather i will post updates on this project as they arise i am thrilled to be involved in something so close to my heart i am grateful to chris' parents walt and billie , dear friends who have included me in this exciting project ! here are some paintings that i have completed based on chris' photos thus far chris' canoe , near golfo , oil on canvas , x chris' pack , stampede trail , oil on panel , x diary of a supertrampstudy , oil on panel , x pilgrim 's dinner , oil on panel , x as a corollary of the pictorial book about chris , the paintings that i produce will be exhibited as a group , probably also happening in or the location has yet to be determined but in all likelihood it will be held at abbozzo gallery in oakville , ontario , canada ideally i would like for the exhibition to travel , because chris was an explorer through and through stay tuned for details surrounding the exhibition and book ! the newfoundland portraits exhibition was a huge success in november many friends and supporters came out to the show i will never forget it ! as for current artistic projects i am continuing to work on individual figurative paintings , commissions and work for galleries there never seems to be enough hours in the day but it is wonderful ! please check out my website for new paintings from the show and out of the studio ! i am also listing songs , posting paintings and offering daily tips on art and creating paintings on my twitter profile here adventure travel and travel in general , along with art , are my two favorite things brings with it many opportunities to explore the world , meet new friends and create some paintings based on these experiences the second book that i will produce will be a travel art book based on explorations of alaska , british columbia , newfoundland , the yukon , arizona , france and new york city and that is just so far ! this book will come out in or i will this blog updated with travel journalling and the status of this project with the onset of the colder weather it is easy to go inward , into a period of emotional and physical hibernation in addition , the holiday season brings with it its own set of emotions , bittersweet ones sometimes ! during this time i think it is particularly important to be easy on ourselves , to open our hearts and minds to others , and to care for ourselves as holidays can be very stressful our society is so often linear , rushing from a to b as quickly as possible when perhaps we could circle back around to a and rest their for awhile as a painter i am always wondering how i can improve , but for the most part i simply do what i do and not overanalyze how and why i do it if you dissect something too much , eventually you will have nothing it is best to keep it as whole as possible and preserve its integrity and beauty as it is although i blog about my paintings and their creation , ultimately it is up to you , dear readers and viewers , to glean from them what you will i wish you and yours a happy holiday season and a prosperous new year ! ! best wishes ! heather to a true artist only that face is beautiful which , quite apart from its exterior , shines with the truth within the soul mahatma gandhi
