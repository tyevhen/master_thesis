i went to see julia julie tonight i 've decided it 's my job to blog about it because there 's no chance that either roy or clinkshrink will go to this movie the storyline is simple a young new yorker named julie is looking for meaning in her life she 's an unpublished novelist who looks for meaning in being a blogger i think she might be my soul mate she becomes obsessed with her cooking blog , and a mission to cook every recipe in julia child 's cookbook that would be recipes oops in days we go back and forth with this plot to julia child in paris in and her role as a bored housewife , also in search of meaning hat making , bridge playing , and finally cooking she takes a class , becomes obsessed , and meets two other french chef women and they become a trio , obsessed with writing a book well , two of them work on this book , , hours a week the third one is not so in to it oy feels a little too familiar ! it takes them years and well , everyone from julia child the chef author tv personality to julie powell the blogger author and now the subject of a movie , all become famous if you take out the cooking and the food , i could totally relate to the obsession of a blog and a book and to all the innuendo both women become fixed on their projects , their lives revolve around them julia child 's publisher is n't so happy with her book again , oy ! and there is some focus on getting the correct title for the book something we shrink rappers are still struggling with so , i'm calling meryl streep in the morning i 'd like her to play me in the shrink rapper movie my nose is a little different , but we do n't have to tell anyone suggestions for the roles of roy clinkshrink , anyone ?
