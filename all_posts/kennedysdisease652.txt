i love this quote from melchor lim we can t change the past , we are living in the present , but we do have some say about the future i write about attitude quite a bit in this blog because there are times in our lives where we feel trapped we begin to believe that our destiny is already written for us living with kennedy s disease , a neuromuscular disorder , can have that effect i know , at times , i have to be careful about feeling trapped with no escape it happens when i am most vulnerable some capability is taken away from me , or some desire to do something is no longer an option out of frustration , i ll forecast these negative thoughts into the future fortunately , someone who reads this blog writes or comments and i realize that there is still tomorrow if i become creative , perhaps a reasonable solution can be applied to the situation at times , we are our own worst enemy during these times , we forget who we are , and , all that we have triumphed over our lives didn t end with kennedy s disease yes , our world is constantly changing , but so was it before this condition entered our lives will we let the past pull us down , or the future raise us up ? the choice is ours photo fromup north
