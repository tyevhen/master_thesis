yesterday i criticized ray kurzweil 's prediction made in a discover article of the arrival of sentient , fully conscious machine intelligences by i 'd like to put more flesh on some of the ideas i talked about earlier because of some of the criteria kurzweil has set for sentient machines e g that they have emotional systems indistinguishable from those of humans , i like to go ahead and assume that the kind of machine kurzweil is talking about would have fears , inhibitions , hopes , dreams , beliefs , a sense of aesthetics , understanding and opinions about spiritual concepts , a subconscious mind , and so on not just the ability to win at chess microtubules appear to play a key role in long term memory i call such a machine homo complete , meaning that the machine has not only computational capabilities but all the things that make the human mind human i argued yesterday that this requires a developmental growth process starting in infancy a homo complete machine would not be recognizably homo sapiens like if it lacked a childhood , in other words it would also need to have an understanding of concepts like gender identity and social responsibility that are , at root , socially constructed and depend on a complex history of interactions with friends , parents , relatives , teachers , role models from real life , from tv , from the movies , etc a successful homo complete machine would have the same cognitive characteristics and unrealized potentials that humans have it would have to have the ability not just to ideate , calculate , and create , but to worry , feel anxiety , have self esteem issues , forget things , be moody , misinterpret things in a characteristically human way , feel guilt , understand what jealousy and hatred are , and so on on top of all that , a homo complete machine would need to have a subconscious mind and the ability to develop mental illnesses and acquire sociopathic thought processes even if the machine is deliberately created as a preeminently normal , fully self actualized intelligence in the maslow complete sense , it would still have to have the potential of becoming depressed , having intrusive thoughts , developing compulsivities , experiencing panic attacks , acquiring addictions to electronic poker , perhaps ! , and so on most of the afflictions described in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders are emergent in nature in other words , you 're not born with them neither would a kurzweil machine be borne with them yet it could acquire them we 're a long way from realizing any of this in silicon kurzweil conveniently makes no mention of how the human brain would be modeled in a homo complete machine one presumes that he views neurons as mini electronic devices like elements of an electrical circuit with firing characteristics that , once adequately modeled mathematically , would account for all of the activities of a human brain under some kind of computer science neural network scheme that 's a peculiarly quaint outlook such a scheme would model the brain about as well as a blow up doll models the human body current mathematical models are impressive see below , for example , but they do n't tell the whole story it 's also necessary to consider the following neurotransmitter vesicle release is probabilistic and possibly non computable beck and eccles have suggested that quantum indeterminacy may be involved in consciousness it 's likely that consciousness occurs primarily in dendritic dendritic processing about which little is known , except that it 's vastly more complex than synapse synapse processing and that classical axonal neuron firing primarily supports more or less automatic , non conscious activities substantial recent work has shown the involvement of protein kinases in mediating memory see , for example below to model this realistically , it would be necessary to have an in depth understanding of the underlying enzyme kinetics to model the brain accurately would require modeling the production , uptake , reuptake , and metabolic breakdown of serotonin , dopamine , norepinephrine , glutamate , and other synaptic substances in a fully dynamic way , accounting for all possible interactions of these substances , in all relevant biochemical contexts it would also require modeling sodium , potassium , and calcium ion channel dynamics to a high degree of accuracy add to that the effect of hormones on various parts of the brain also add intracellular phosphate metabolism phosphates are key to the action of protein kinases , which , as mentioned before , are involved in memory recent work has established that microtubules are responsible not only for maintaining and regulating neuronal conformation , but in addition , they service ion channels and synaptic receptors , provide for neurotransmitter vesicle transport and release , and are involved in second messenger post synaptic signaling moreover , they 're believed to affect post synaptic receptor activation according to hameroff and penrose , it 's possible even likely that microtubules directly facilitate computation , both classically and by quantum coherent superposition see this remarkable blog post for details kurzweil is undoubtedly correct to imply that we 'll know a great deal more about brain function in than we do now , and in all likelihood we will indeed begin to see , by then , machines that convincingly replicate certain individual aspects or modalities of human brain activity but to say that we will see , by , the development of computers with true consciousness , plus emotions and all the other things that make the human brain human , is nonsense we 'll be lucky to see such a thing in less than several hundred years if ever references alkon , d l memory storage and neural systems scientific american beck , f and eccles , j c quantum aspects of brain activity and the role of consciousness proc natl acad sci usa buchholtz et al , mathematical model of an identified stomatogastric ganglion neuron , j neurophysiology , february hameroff s cytoplasmic gel states and ordered water possible roles in biological quantum coherence proceedings of the second advanced water symposium , dallas , texas , october , http www u arizona edu hameroff water html hameroff , s r , and penrose , r , a orchestrated reduction of quantum coherence in brain microtubules a model for consciousness in toward a science of consciousness , the first tucson discussions and debates , s r hameroff , a kaszniak and a c scott eds , mit press , , cambridge , ma also published in mathematics and computers in simulation toward a science of consciousness ii the tucson discussions and debates , stuart hameroff , alfred kaszniak , and alwyn scott , editors mit press , cambridge ma pribram , k h brain and perception lawrence erlbaum , new jersey rovelli c , smolin l a discreteness of area and volume in quantum gravity nuclear physics b shema et al , rapid erasure of long term memory associations in the cortex by an inhibitor of pkm , science , pp , august
