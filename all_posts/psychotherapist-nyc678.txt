celebrate your success setting and accomplishing goals can be challenging when you succeed at attaining your goals , it 's important to acknowledge your hard work and perseverance by celebrating your success yet , so many people have a hard time recognizing and acknowledging their success feeling empty rather than happy after accomplishing a goal over the years , so many people have told me that they looked forward to accomplishing a long term goal , but after they succeeded , they felt empty inside rather than feeling happy that they attained a hard won success , they feel nothing for instance , i 've known a number of people who work full time and go to college at night this can be very challenging i know this from personal experience because i attended college for years at night while i worked full time when it comes time to attend their graduation , many of these same people just do n't go they make all kinds of excuses for not attending their graduation ceremony , but it 's clear they 're uncomfortable and they do n't know why an inability to celebrate success is often a deeply rooted problem often , this problem of being unable to celebrate success is deeply rooted in earlier problems for each person , it will be different but an inability to celebrate a success is a real problem that can follow you throughout your life robbing you of the joy you could feel for your accomplishments for many people who have been emotionally traumatized in life , they feel a need to be always vigilant for the next bad thing that might happen in their lives letting down their guard to be happy and celebrate a success just does n't feel like an option for them they might not even realize that this is what 's keeping them from feeling good but , often , when they come to therapy , they realize that they have old emotional wounds to work through getting help if you 're someone who has problems acknowledging and celebrating your successes in life and you have n't been able to overcome this on your own , you owe it to yourself to seek professional help to work through this issue life is short and it brings both joy and sorrow if you 're only able to feel the sorrow , you 're depriving yourself of many happy moments in life it 's possible to overcome this problem , if you 're willing to take the first step to get help to heal i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist i work with individual adults and couples i have helped many clients to overcome emotional obstacles so they can lead more fulfilling lives to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at photo credit photo pin
