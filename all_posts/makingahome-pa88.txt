we went to a local u pick strawberry farm this past saturday we picked for a little over an hour and got almost pounds of strawberries ! the kids had a wonderful time , and they both had so much fun picking ! the hardest part was fighting the temptation to pop them in our mouths ! after picking , we headed to yellow creek state park for a picnic picnicking is one of our favorite things to do in the summer and we do it often it 's very economical , and our kids just love it no need for an extravagant outing just pack up a nice little lunch and grab your picnic blanket , and you 're all set to go we have found that state parks are awesome spots for outings because they have lots of picnicking areas and many have play areas and beaches i packed up ham sandwiches with american cheese and lettuce and onions from our garden i also cut up some refreshing honeydew , and packed baby carrots and garden zucchini with ranch to dip them in oh , and we could n't picnic without a bag of our favorite potato chips cape cod kettle cooked yummy ! it was such a scrumptious and refreshing lunch to have after picking our strawberries after a game of soccer and a short swing on the tire swing , we ended our day eating bomb pops on the beach this was a nice little treat for the kids that they thoroughly enjoyed ! we have definitely added strawberry picking to our mental list of family activities to do annually so , you may ask what i'm going to do with pounds of strawberries well , we 've already eaten a bunch and as for the rest of them ? well , that 's my project today fresh strawberry pies and yummy strawberry jam i'm off to start !
