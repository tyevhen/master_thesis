the other day i was sat on my bed , going through a really depressive episode and i was just thinking to myself , why ca n't i be normal ? why ca n't i just float through life ? of course there is the age old question of what is normality ? but what i mean is , why ca n't i just accept things the way they are to not have anxiety and depression , to not think about death , to not over analyse everything , to laugh more , to not think so philosophically every single day , to just be young and free like i should be and to not be dissocated from my own person i feel that a lot of my friends , perhaps do n't think like i do and although comparison is a killer , i just ca n't help but notice how nice it would be just to go through life more lightly but , maybe this is just me from a very young age i have thought things that my peers did n't and i spoke to adults because i found it more interesting and as years went by i started to experience symptoms of depression and anxiety and it 's true to say that people who tend to think this way , are more likely to experience these kind of symptoms although i feel being this way enriches my life to an extent and has created life for me that perhaps i would never have achieved otherwise , i ca n't help but get tired the fact that i just cannot switch my brain off , or just do something withough aching but at the end of the day , i'm not sure i 'll ever know what its like just to float through life without few cares , and perhaps i can use this to my advantage because , unless i find a way of changing the way i think , which may be possible , this is who i am and this is who we are and it 's something that i'm going to continue work with , because otherwise it will just be another pressure to add to myself everyone is different and no one is really normal , so everyone sees things differently , and they all have demons of their own , just perhaps you ca n't see them it 's about learning to work with yourself , and to understand that you are your own person and there 's nothing to be ashamed of heck , it might take more time to feel better and work on yourself and it might be a difficult uphill struggle and be tiring but , this is who you 've got to deal with for the rest of yourself , and in a way , that makes it special , because no one else works the way you do best wishes , amy xx
