the term self taught is bandied about a lot in self directed education circles people learning outside the strictures of formal institutions , classes , or tutors are deemed have taught themselves , taken on the internal role of both student and teacher and yet self taught is not really a term i like or use myself to me , self taught implies that learning happens in a vacuum alone , without external influences , without help , without the plethora of human resources available in this world unschooling is too often viewed , in my opinion , as something both insular and perhaps even lonely that age old socialization myth , along with being almost arrogant in nature you think you know enough to teach yourselves ? you certainly have a high opinion of your skills while there are really great aspects of independence that life learning obviously provides after all , the whole point is self directed learning , making your own decisions about what you choose to do with your time i think there s an important distinction to be made between independence and isolation between learning which is self directed , and knowledge which is supposedly self taught the reality of unschooling is that it functions best within community , with the support of myriads of different people sometimes even teachers ! besides , being self taught may not even be possible after all , even if you learn something from books , youtube videos , or observation , someone wrote those books , filmed those videos , and is practicing their skills in a place you can observe them i ve said it before , but as far as i m concerned it bears frequent repetition unschooling is about opening up more of the world to children than they d generally encounter in school , not less spending time around a wider variety of people ages , backgrounds , skills , not fewer life learning is truly a community venture , rooted in the unique places we inhabit , not a solo expedition in self teaching what do i personally like to emphasize , instead ? delight driven learning that starts with a spark , building curiosity , a burst of inspiration , excitement , delight inquiry based finding the answers to a question or a hundred questions , the solution to a real problem , exploring the world with interest and thoughtfulness and wonder self directed choosing which pursuits are worth pursuing , who you turn to for support and direction , what you spend your time in doing life learning doesn t seek to turn everything into teaching , whether by yourself or others , and it certainly isn t about going it alone and lonely at least if you can possibly help it instead it s about taking advantage of any opportunities available to you , if they seem important or interesting , and shaping a collaborative , self directed education doesn t that sound a lot better than self taught ? you might also like my favourite novels of i get my very own week , courtesy of the unschooler occasionally sunday means links i want to unschool , but what if my kids just watch tv linkwithin
