i sat down just now to bang out a blog on fear i planned to trot out quotes from fdr , the rd psalm and my own harrowing experiences in dark places with no way to get out then i decided to write about hope fear and hope may be the two ends of the mental health spectrum that best describe how i feel at any time not my physical feeling not my mental state the state of my soul hope is the most powerful thing in the world , not a dangerous thing as red suggests in the shawshank redemption it has been the difference between giving up and pressing on for me , probably even life and death my hope comes from my faith it is also comes from something god put in my chest when i was born the only reason i ve kept fighting when i ve wanted to give up so many times is that , no matter how bad or pessimistic or miserable i felt , there was always some small glimmer of hope deep in my soul telling me not to give up i can t write this blog without acknowledging that i did give up , overwhelmed by pain and confusion and disillusionment i guess you could say i lost hope that day i ll write more on that later if all this seems a little contradictory or dualistic , well it is so is life with bipolar disorder i don t know what else to credit for my improvement other than faith and hope god had another plan for my life a second act it includes some suffering too , but all for a greater good ever since i left for the menninger clinic last september , my faith has been a lighthouse in the foggy distance there have been moments of misery , times of deep despair that challenged my faith and tried to break me but they didn t in months since the worst day of my life , i ve rediscovered my family , made a professional change that has so far worked out swimmingly , gotten in better shape , lost pounds and learned to trust god more fully i would call that a pretty good comeback i hesitated to share all this because i m a bit superstitious when it comes to my mental health i know a spectacular crash can happen at any time for any reason that s just how it is , and that s why fear lurks somewhere in the dark corner of our souls even on the good days i share it because i ve talked to too many people suffering from mental illness they need more than a good therapist they need more than the best drugs they need a little hope red is right hope can feel like a dangerous thing , and i suppose sometimes it is but if we can t hope for better days , for a better life , what do we have to live for ? that would be the most dangerous thing of all
