? this puzzle comes by way of a terrific blog post by james marcus bach , who in turn got the puzzle from trey klein bach candidly reports i found it difficult to solve took me a couple of hours as a rule , i hate puzzles of the recreational purposeless , do nothing sort colloquially known as brain teasers simply because they accomplish nothing except to waste time and make me feel stupid i either already know the trick , or when i find out what the trick is , it turns out not to be useful for anything other than solving the puzzle in question then i feel cheated and stupid but i'm inherently a masochist , so naturally , when i saw the above puzzle , i just had to try it i resolved not to spend more than two or three minutes on it , though it turns out , i got the puzzle right , and it took me only a minute or so you might want to stare at the numbers yourself for a couple minutes now , before reading the next paragraph the supposed answer and its reasoning involving a somewhat painful looking formula with modulo arithmetic is given here i took a far more pragmatic approach i looked only at occurrences of and saw that in out of cases , a appeared on the right hand side of the equals sign if this is some kind of casino game and i'm betting real money , and i see come up again , i'm betting on being the answer i decided to reverse every line of the problem and try it again i looked at each occurrence of and again , out of times , ends up paired with that 's it , i decided the answer must be it turns out is the correct answer but you just guessed ! someone will say you did n't prove that the answer is my retort is that neither did the person who wrote the explanation given here prove that the inevitable answer is , because he or she did n't prove that the given explanation is the only explanation that will work he merely gave an explanation that is consistent with being the answer i'm sure if i had hours , i could come up with at least a couple of formulas that , given the input data shown above , will be consistent with an answer of i can also come up with a couple of formulas that are consistent with an answer of so which formula out of these several formulae is correct ? is any one formula provably the only possible correct one ? that 's the question i 'd argue it 's not even possible to know if that question can be answered still , is it reasonable to attack a problem like this heuristically , and bet on an answer that seems statistically likely to be correct ? is it better to spend hours arriving at a formula that 's consistent with a given answer but that could be shot down by a different formula later ? what kind of approach do you take if you 're in an out of control spacecraft and you need an answer within minutes or you 'll burn up on re entry ? what if you 're in the titanic and have a full hours' notice of icebergs ahead and need to decide on the correct heading to take ? do you bet the farm on a heuristic method or on a formula that seems right and has the appearance of being rigorous , because it 's so formulaic but is n't provably correct ? i think the approach you take depends on the situation , but it also depends on your personal working style in the absence of a reason not to , i tend to take a heuristic approach my style is not to waste time , even when i have time to waste what 's yours ?
