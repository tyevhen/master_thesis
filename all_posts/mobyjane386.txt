dear a b , i 've been also feeling guilty that i just collapse into bed right after i get home from work from fatigue and exhaustion i feel i'm not working on the depression enough by just staying in bed , i feel i should exercize , eat properly or engage in some activities but just ca n't find the energy at the moment and i do need all the energy to get through work right now but again , maybe i'm being too hard on myself it 's a fine line is n't it lazy or relaxing ? y dear y when you have put in a good day 's work , and the work has been difficult , and you have stuck to the work and finished , then it is time to rest and relax you should eat properly but this should be a matter of a little forethought rather than fixing anything elaborate perhaps work is the only activity you have the energy for at the moment that is quite all right as the work becomes easier you will have more energy for other things a b curtiss
