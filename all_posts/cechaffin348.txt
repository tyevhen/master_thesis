i'm not at home , but i found this on the web for an easter poem admittedly it is n't a very happy poem , but it is an honest poem about too early a conversion and the psychological damage that ensued from that adoption of absolutes while still a teen published in poets' canvas easter in hyperion dan simmons invents the shrike , a monster of blades and rays outside of time all that approach are slain , yet i find him less fearful than jehovah , and as for christ , i am ashamed what should i say ? forgive , o lord the way i wound my fellows , calling my black humor a rubber knife ? forgive my jealousy of you who renders me forever second born ? at sixteen , head emptied by acid , i did n't feel joy but dread electrify my sternum when converted the pimpled corpse god claimed inside that yearbook picture would never rise a virgin until married , i gave triple tithes while a poor student what does a child know ? your unimaginable grace was just that i labored not in faith but out of fear , fear of missing your voice for which i paid in voices multiplied , none of them yours i expect no better of the dead and so you say we are born but when my world was young you made me old , a dwarf oak riddled with scars and squirrel holes this is no brag but what the pentecostal whirlwind reaped of me , and little enough it is mercy is beyond me lent may take cigarettes or chocolate but not my blood besides , mine is n't magic have a joyous easter in any case when it comes to an example of a happy faith , i'm not much better than kierkegaard ce
