happy holidays to everyone ! i hope you all spent time with people you love however , as i noted in my last post , i know that 's sometimes an issue for those of us with mental illness for a variety of reasons , we may spend this holiday of all holidays alone as for me , i had time with friends , but i also spent a lot of time alone for me , the last two days were , in many ways , nothing more than normal days i ran i biked i cleaned my house i went to my aa meeting i did my laundry i watched television i went grocery shopping i updated facebook i listened to npr normal days for a variety of reasons , i did n't see family i did n't open presents i did n't have a house full of people christmas eve , in particular , was a very long day and i 'd be lying if i said i did n't feel a little sorry for myself after working out , cleaning , doing some laundry , and grocery shopping , there was nothing left to do my friends were spending time with their family my family was silent from afar the special ness of the day was evident everywhere i went from the excited families and lovers last minute shopping in walmart , to the extra cars with far away license plates crowding my street i began to feel very , very sad i got dressed up and went to church that evening it was a beautiful service , but again , it was impossible not to feel very , very alone i sat in the back there was one other woman , apparently alone as well , sitting in my pew before me the church was filled with smiling extended families i was envious perhaps it would have been better not to go , yet sitting alone at home would n't have felt good either i left the service feeling a strange combination of celebration and sadness i teared up as i got into my car i could have gone home and really let the sadness overtake me , but i dialed my phone instead when cindy answered my voice broke why do n't you come over here , she said ? and so i did i collected puck , put on some sweats , and headed back out the door for a moment , i had stood on the precipice of the hole , but thankfully i did n't jump in i'm so glad i made that call yesterday was another normal day until dinner , at which time puck and i headed out again bill and cindy made a lovely dinner , we chuckled our way through a christmas story , and we lounged around listening to christmas tunes together a nice , relaxed time was had by all it was christmas , and ultimately , i spent my time with the family i love , the family who knows me best , and the family with whom i can most be myself that was my christmas i hope you , too , found your family over these past two days i hope you did what you needed to do to keep yourself safe and healthy happy holidays , my friends
