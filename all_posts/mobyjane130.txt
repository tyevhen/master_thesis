hi a b ! yes , it is easy to be philosophical about adversity when we are not in the midst of it on the same thread , someone quoted buddhist master thich nat hanh the quote was very popular , many said they 'd like to keep it pinned up where they could see it below is the quote my response , which received no replies i felt it was important to note that we do n't always immediately have the capacity to be serene we need n't judge ourselves as spiritual flunkies for experiencing a full range of emotions while we do n't need to cling to pain , for a while we may need to let it be trusting it 's all grist for the mill serenity is not freedom from the storm but being at peace during the storm ginger 's response yes , this is a lovely , poetic way to describe being present to what is allowing , not resisting the now , in whatever form it presents and if we find ourselves unable to accept the storm , and fear , not a sense of peace , comes up for us in the midst of it , we can have compassion for ourselves accept that too then , we have still created a space for presence we have accepted our unacceptance ! ginger dear ginger , you have said something very important here accepting our unacceptance it is a good ploy to keep going back to the first thing you can say yes to in the way of self acceptance it is a way of being loving to ourselves we are usually much too hard on ourselves by going to the first thing you can say yes to you will make it clear to yourself , , in what ways you have been being negative , and , that you can turn a negative situation around this way , no matter how negative you get on yourself you can keep accepting your own negativity and in so doing , recharge yourself from negative to positive when you are in a positive mode that is much closer to love than the negative we always want to head for the positive , for love , for acceptance , for life saying yes connects us saying no separates us your mind can get very tricky about semantics the mind will say something like but you have to say no to bad things , do n't you ? not necessarily instead of saying no to something bad , you can do the loving switch and just say yes to something good just remember joel goldsmith 's warning you ca n't get to truth through the reasoning process which is another way of saying you ca n't perceive truth as an object you can be the truth , but you ca n't know the truth truth and love are the same you ca n't know love you can be love by loving that 's why the positive , loving path is always the direction to head another thing to remember , the tiniest baby step in the right direction turns you degrees around from going in the negative direction ! the tiniest positive baby step is more powerful than the most giant negative step this is how redemption and recovery is always possible a b
