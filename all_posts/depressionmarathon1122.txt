as you know , i made a decision a couple weeks ago to look for a regularly scheduled , part time , physical therapist position , otherwise known as a job while i 've been working as an on call pt for several years , i have not felt well enough to resume a regularly scheduled job until recently of course , recently i 've also not been doing so hot , but i'm sure some of those symptoms were triggered by this decision and the risk it entailed well , last week , i was hired as of december , , i will be gainfully employed and eligible to drop disability ! hooray ! this is a big deal i 've come full circle in exactly eight years my illness began in november , , leading me quickly to disability hopefully november of will be the beginning of the end of the disability portion of this saga i do n't expect the illness to go away i'm hoping to live with it at a higher level than i 've been able to these past eight years in the future , i hope my story will include november , , as the time when fuller functioning returned i guess i 'll have to wait to see if that will be the case
