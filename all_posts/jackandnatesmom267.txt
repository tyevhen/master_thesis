sorry it 's been so long i will be honest , i 've been pretty unmotivated to write since we got back from our trip lots to do , non sleeping children , and just the need to continue spending quality time with them we trekked off to the outer banks for christmas and not just the outer banks , but hatteras island and not just hatteras island but all the way down to hatteras itself for any of you who go to duck , or corolla , it is worth the journey to stay all the way down on the island sooooooooo peaceful , even in the summer , which we have done before too in fact , the last time we went , jack was and nate was mos prediagnosis i think that 's part of why we wanted to go back we remembered it as a happy time , before things got so complicated of course we did n't recognize that at the time ha by traveling so far away we took all of the holiday hoopla completely out of the equation it was just us i was nervous that this would be so much work that it would n't be relaxing , but that was not the case at all we just reminded ourselves over and over again that there was no agenda , there were no expectations just us and it worked the only major outing that occurred was a trip to the wright brothers museum up in kitty hawk do n't think i have to explain that one other than that , we pretty much settled in for some good old family time hatteras island is the antithesis of the typical beach resort , especially in the winter yes there are some souvenir shops , but few and far between , and mostly closed in the off season there is one major grocery store on the mile long island , and fewer than gas stations there is one highway that goes all the way down , and it was actually closed from september until about days before we left on our trip they had an emergency ferry in place after hurricane sandy they just reopened the road it 's one lane , and they are constantly placing huge sandbags , as the waves crash right behind them it 's quite a site we managed to make a pretty nice christmas i brought a small tree and some cheap ornaments , and i sat down and did some of the things i never find time to do around the holidays gingerbread house , letters to santa , art projects which jack despised of course even managed a pretty nice christmas dinner a few shots from a very relaxed day then of course there was the beach we were the only ones on the beach every time we walked over there there is just no greater feeling of peace i highly recommend a beach christmas to all families , but particularly autism families i 'll say it again peace priceless !
