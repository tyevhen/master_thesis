the days before a break are incredibly hectic there is the pressure of finals , students stressing out over grades , the push for toy and clothes collections by students , and those last minute tutoring sessions i can tolerate almost anything before the break , but there was a storm brewing that included bullying on social media which curtailed my holiday cheer monday morning blues monday mornings are always hectic in the counseling office kids are constantly in and out of our offices before running off to class , but two students stayed in our lobby waiting to talk to me unfortunately , the content of their conversation was not so unfamiliar to me as a school counselor the students revealed that they had been slandered on instagram as a thot the urban dictionary defines a thot as a promiscuous girl the girls were visibly upset and confused about what to do to reclaim their reputations that had been wounded on this popular website and i was wondering how was i going to help these young ladies ? not long after talking to the girls , an administrator brought down two students who had gotten into trouble for making inappropriate comments about the contents of a video they had shared in their class of a young girl performing a inappropriate act with another student apparently , the whole class was in an uproar and the teacher could not regain control i told the administrator that i would talk to the students and see how i could help as the two students waited by my door , my mind begin to race of what i was going to say to these students unfortunately , these scenes are becoming more and more frequent as lead counselor , it is my responsibility to educate my department on what to do when cyber bullying is reported by staff , students , or parents although adults have the self discipline to step away from the internet and take a break , teens are so enmeshed in social media that cannot break away from the constant taunts or torture to tell a student to just ignore or stop looking at the posts is not a very effective strategy to deal with cyber bullying in fact , students are less likely to report cyber bullying due to the fear of retaliation , fear of ostracism by their friends , fear of embarrassment , the fear of their technology being taken away , or the fear of punishment by adults as school counselors , we must know our role in dealing with cyber bullying we educate the school community about cyber bullying , we implement strategies to prevent cyber bullying , we employ the correct procedures to intervene in cyber bullying situations , and we work with victims and the perpetrators of bullying what is cyber bullying ? cyber bullying according to beyond the bully website includes harassment through hurtful , rude , or mean text messages , email , or postings other methods include spreading rumors or lies about others through email or social networks instagram , ask fm , twitter , facebook and creating websites
