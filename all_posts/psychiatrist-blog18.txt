obviously , psychiatry has changed over time we 've gone from a field where treatment was mostly psychotherapy i 'll purposely omit insulin shock , leeches , and lobotomy to one of symptoms , prescriptions , and side effects , as though these things occur outside of the context of a person 's life ah , you 've heard me rant before and like all of medicine , it 's no longer just about treating patients , it 's about checking the right boxes , coding what happened in the session by the minute , those damn cpt codes , and now about the technology and the hits your fees take if you wo n't e prescribe , file pqrs ? huh data , and practice the way the insurers want , if you choose to accept insurance or work for an agency that does with all that in mind , i saw this lovely and angsty post on facebook , and asked the author to join shrink rap as a guest poster i was so pleased when dr maher said yes her guest post is below i 'll be next month , i will have been in private practice for nearly years , and i'm trying to decide where to go from here if you have time , would you help me think through this difficult decision ? i trained in a time and a place when psychiatric treatment , other than for the severe mental illnesses , was about psychoanalysis even if you did n't go on for analytic training which i did , right after residency , at one of the most classical institutes in nyc , your primary goal was to search for and speak to the complex humanity of the other my th year psychopharm course was optional yes , the classical model was flawed in significant ways , but over time i took what i needed from it , i owned it and i loved it then prozac arrived on the scene and i woke up in a different profession no longer was it about meaning and humanity and insight into who you are , how you got to be that way , and the unconscious forces that led you to get in your own way no longer was transference the mechanism of action my field became about symptom constellations , drugs and or skills to fix what was wrong with you this perspective always felt wrong to me , but over time i came to integrate the parts that felt right with the work i was trained to do , and it worked pretty well i have a very good practice , partially private pay and partially insurance based aside from medicare helpful when some of your patients have been with you for years , the other insurance i accept is the one that the nyc dept of education uses many of my patients are teachers , so their psychopathology falls within a range that i'm comfortable treating once long ago , that insurance company called and asked me to take a patient off their hands she was a paranoid , depressed , obsessional , suicidal , entitled , angry and litigious woman who fired every psychiatrist she saw , called the plan daily and threatened to sue everyone she spoke to i told them i would only take her if i could see her days week indefinitely , no questions asked they said yes , and she never bothered them again they left me alone after that i 've seen some people weekly for years without being bothered but times are changing , yet again no one would remember me from that time no one would bend the rules to allow a shrink with dynamic understanding to engage a patient like that the billing , coding and documentation requirements , and the medical complexities , are becoming more than i feel comfortable with i'm finding it increasingly hard to integrate the complex , struggling human being that i see with the symptom and treatment picture that i'm required to see i 've moved into other arenas , including a not for profit organization , documentary filmmaking , and the development of an emotional literacy curriculum for young people but there 's no money involved in any of them they cost money i love my work and i love my patients and i think they benefit from working with me i know what i know and i know when to refer to to ask for help when i do psychodynamic talk therapy i hate when they call it that ! ! , i'm doing something very complex , something i'm very well trained for but there 's no code for that and very little respect for it , and i live in fear of being audited if you 've read this far , thanks so much i 'd be grateful to hear your reactions
