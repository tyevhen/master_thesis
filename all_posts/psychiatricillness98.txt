my ex boss is either a complete total tosser or he is taking advantage of my low mood and lack of confidence i like to think good of people so i am going with the first option with a little bit of ignorance on his side but god i feel vulnerable and unhappy i did not realise people could be like that and i have never felt such hatred for anyone before i have never hated anyone so much everytime i talk to my sister she naggs that i m not talkative , that i sound tired and tells me off for not looking after myself is this what family support is suppose to be like ! ! ! i want to throw things at her i do n't feel there is anyone in the world who i can talk to o
