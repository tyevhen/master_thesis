sitting under my artificial sun light , eating oatmeal , drinking coffee , and watching espn , i'm already dressed in my scrubs and ready to go to work it 's monday , after all , and work is what i do on monday i made it through the long holiday weekend it was n't necessarily pretty , and it certainly was n't easy , but i did not let depression totally knock me down at times it was hard to move depression weighed heavy on my limbs but i took puck for his walks and made it to an appointment for him as is typical , he made me smile at times it was difficult to reach out depression weighed heavy on my soul but i finally called my friends , and they kindly took me in we shared a few meals and hung out they even made me laugh at times it was almost impossible to handle the distress depression wreaked havoc on my thinking but i practiced some of the skills i 'd been taught cognitively , despite how i felt , i knew this would eventually pass it 's always passed in the past , and despite how miserable i felt in the moment , i had to focus on that i did the best i could , and here i am it 's monday i'm ready for work i do n't know what this day will hold i ca n't afford to worry about that i 'll do my best to take it as it comes i have a few hiding spots at work where i can stop and take a breath when and if that 's needed i'm a competent physical therapist no matter the turmoil raging inside i look forward to seeing my patients and letting them pull me outside myself for awhile it will be a relief to focus on them rather then misery i'm ready today , i will not let depression totally knock me down
