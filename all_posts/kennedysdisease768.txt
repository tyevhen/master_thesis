i thought i published an article on this study , but cannot find it so , here it is target identified for rare inherited neurological disease scientists show bad androgen receptor impairs body s ability to dispose of damaged cells researchers at university of california , san diego school of medicine have identified the mechanism by which a rare , inherited neurodegenerative disease causes often crippling muscle weakness in men , in addition to reduced fertility the study , published august in the journal nature neuroscience , shows that a gene mutation long recognized as a key to the development of kennedy s disease impairs the body s ability to degrade , remove and recycle clumps of trash proteins that may otherwise build up on neurons , progressively impairing their ability to control muscle contraction this mechanism , called autophagy , is akin to a garbage disposal system and is the only way for the body to purge itself of non working , misshapen trash proteins we ve known since the mid s that alzheimer 's disease , parkinson 's disease and huntington 's disease are caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins that should have been degraded , but cannot be turned over , said senior author albert la spada , md , phd and professor of pediatrics , cellular and molecular medicine , and neurosciences the value of this study is that it identifies a target for halting the progression of protein build up , not just in this rare disease , but in many other diseases that are associated with impaired autophagy pathway function our study tells us that if we can find a way to keep tfeb working , we likely can prevent this disease and others like it from progressing , la spada said we now have a target for new therapies to treat not only kennedy 's disease , but also many more common neurological disorders follow this link to read the entire article uc san diego news
