dear a b i just finished your book children of the gods and what a fantastic book it is ! i had originally been putting books on ebay to supplement my income and i was about to list this one i had no idea what it was about but i knew it was a first edition signed by the author i browsed through it and got hooked i read it from cover to cover right then and there and now i would never part with it i intend to read it over and over i ca n't believe how beautifully you weaved such eternal truth and knowledge into a very pleasurable narrative this would be a perfect candidate for an audio version , but i ca n't find one any thoughts to making one ? sincerely , e h dear e h yes , i thought about doing an audio before but just never got around to it i did n't sell very many of these books my book the little chapel that stood is my best seller brainswitch out of depression does well but strangely enough children of the gods is now in the hands of an off broadway producer who came across the book and loved it collaborating with a music professor in capitol univ in columbus ohio to make it into a musical who knows ? i got a call at pm from my daughter 's tennis coach years ago who said he had the book on his shelf for years i had given him a copy and just read it and had to call me to tell me what a profound effect it had on his life you just never know when you write something where it is going to end up thanks so much for writing i 'll put your letter on my blog http mobyjane blogspot com my webmaster said i 've received over , hits and that 's good not much of a techie myself again i really appreciate that you took the time to write a b curtiss
