when isaac newton was trying to discover the mystery of white light , one can only imagine the wonder and excitement he experienced when he placed a prism in it s path that revealed the vast spectrum of colours contained within previously thought of as being an entity of it s own , he discovered the essence of light was the amalgamation of several different colours we don t need a prism to recreate this amazing experience today , nature takes care of it in her own mystical way each rainbow is a glimpse into the realm of the invisible world that surrounds us as daylight hits a water droplet to display the secret parquet of colours that dwell within light gazing at a rainbow captures the heart and fires the imagination as we amaze at its beauty and wonder and elusiveness white light is a powerful symbol within the human species , especially for those whom are members of the catholic church people whom have near death experiences often recall seeing a white light jesus is often represented in paintings and other images with his body luminous from a white light emanating from within one of the central moments in christian teachings is the transfiguration of jesus on mount tabor where he begins to shine with white light and become radiant upon the mountain the teachings describe this as the pivotal point at which human nature meets god white light doesn t show favour to any one spectrum of colour over the other it doesn t discriminate between the richness of its red or the vibrancy of its yellow it values and appreciates equally all the different constituents contained within its structure for it knows that without any one of these , it ceases to exist in its purest form and can t fulfil its duty to bring to life and to view all the majesty and splendour that pertains in this planet we call earth is there a powerful message contained within the purity of white light and the magnificence of a rainbow for us as human beings are they enlightening and informing us that unless we as a species begin to treat equally and without discrimination the vast spectrum of human beings that exist within our planet , beings with different personalities and characteristics to their existence , people of diverse religious faiths , people of no faith , people with different coloured skin , people whose relationships involve members of the opposite sex , same sex or no sex , that unless we can begin to fully understand and cherish our differences and uniqueness as individuals and celebrate and embrace the myriad of common desires that we all share , primary among them to love and be loved , that until that day arrives , then we can never as a species reach the pivotal point at which human nature and human beings can merge their independent spectrums of light and stand out in their own true radiance , dwelling within that flowing beauty of pure white light and achieve fully our boundless potential as spiritual beings whether jesus christ was the son of god or just an incredibly evolved human being is a discussion for another day but his constant message throughout his life was to love your neighbour , as yourself sadly , in the church , they conveniently forgot to teach and affirm the last part of his original message , to love ourselves it was wise of them to do that because the person that is in love with themselves , not in a narcissistic way where they believe the world revolves around them but in a way that they come in to an awareness of their own innate worth and immense value as a human being , independent of anything they may have achieved or not achieved in their life and the opinions and judgements of others , will not allow themselves to be controlled or dictated to by any religion or organisation there is nothing more powerful or with a greater capacity for freedom in this world than the human self and this self always wants to be free to live its own life and express all of its vast expansiveness , it s emotional self , social self , intellectual self , physical self and sexual self to name but a few for those people whose sexual expression encompasses the loving of a member of the same gender , it can be a difficult and challenging journey before you arrive at a point where you can find joy in your sexuality and fully embrace and live this aspect of your life depression forced me on a pilgrimage of exploration through the deep valleys , high mountains and forests of the unknown of my interior life , a journey that continues to this day and will until my last breadth is taken i ve come to appreciate and befriend the beautiful complexity of my inner worlds and realise that the journey and navigating of life is a path through many forests of the unknown but that hidden within the silent depths of these sacred places are many of the answers i seek to the deeper questions of my life as i began to emerge from the darkest periods of my depression , an experience that lasted from my early teens through to my mid twenties , and began to come into harmony with my own voice and more solid in my own sense of self , the old cages that had confined me to an un lived life began to dissolve and new frontiers of possibility and invitations for growth re awakened within my soul one of those invitations was in relation to my sexuality the task of true knowing takes time and is challenging but once a glimpse of your real and authentic self is experienced , once you come to see the defences you have built and the limitations you have accepted in your life to prevent further inner , silent wounds , you realise you will never again be truly satisfied with your old way of being , the emptiness of false living so that those around you will not be upset this above all , says shakespeare in hamlet , to thine own self be true and it must follow , as the night , the day , thou canst not then be false to any man it s at this moment that the support of others becomes crucial because being real in what in many ways is an unreal world can be a terrifying experience at this vulnerable time , a person may only require the presence and kindness and love of a friend to enable them to summon their courage and do whatever it is they have to do when i reached this point in my life , i often read the poem by mary oliver called the journey one day you finally knew what you had to do , and began , though the voices around you kept shouting their bad advice though the whole house began to tremble and you felt the old tug at your ankles mend my life ! each voice cried but you did n't stop you knew what you had to do , though the wind pried with its stiff fingers at the very foundations , though their melancholy was terrible it was already late enough , and a wild night , and the road full of fallen branches and stones but little by little , as you left their voices behind , the stars began to burn through the sheets of clouds , and there was a new voice which you slowly recognized as your own , that kept you company as you strode deeper and deeper into the world , determined to do the only thing you could do determined to save the only life you could save expressing an attraction to a member of the same gender is not coming out of the closet , it s about be coming true to your own self , answering your sacred and precious self s silent whispering and call from deep within , re aligning your inner and outer worlds to the tune and rhythm and beat of your own drum and returning home to the sanctuary and dignity of your soul where the silence and stillness of an empty church sit side by side with the energy and fire of a rampant volcano in ireland , there may not be groups attending events waving banners opposing homosexuality , there may not be gangs stalking the streets and hunting down people attracted to members of the same sex and torturing or killing them like there are in other parts of the world but in definite , subtle ways , there are subliminal messages lingering in the atmosphere of our society and are absorbed and seep into the minds and actions of individuals that being in the minority in terms of the expression of your sexuality means you are somehow less than as a human being the words used by our young people in schools and coaches of sports teams to describe a boy or man as weak , the stereotyping in public forums of what it is to be a gay man , section of the employment equality act which ensures legalised discrimination against people labelled transgender , bisexual , lesbian and gay in the education and healthcare sectors , the inequality under the law for those whom choose to marry , all in their own explicit way combine to espouse and maybe unintentionally , certainly encourage and give fuel to the continued less than message nearly all of these actions find their sources in the echoes of previous generations where the shackling and repression of the human spirit and self was enforced and liberation and the championing of the uniqueness and differences of each individual was denied sadly , for some individuals that continue to promote this message , they have failed to emerge from their shells of antiquity , continuing to live the life of others , their voices not their own but belonging to an era long gone truth alone will endure says gandhi , all the rest will be washed away before the tide of time tide and time waits for no man and despite the efforts of some to cling to the past , the truth of all men being created equal will always endure for some , the discovery that they are attracted to a member of the same sex can be a tortuous experience maya angelou once said there is no greater agony than the bearing of an untold story within you there is a certain joy in remaining hidden but it is a terrible tragedy if the real you can never be found for many reasons and ones which are unique to each individual , some people have to de press their attraction to a fellow man or woman and live lives of quiet desperation , silent misery and dark depression the agony of their untold stories is carried to their graves , either through natural death or the ending of their lives through suicide no human being emerges from their mother s womb feeling fearful and anxious about themselves , feeling frightened about being true to themselves , feeling less than as a human being , feeling they have to hide their love its society that creates the culture and atmosphere that makes people feel like that and society is only ever a collection of individuals in ireland , the saying goes it takes a community to raise a child so in various ways , we all carry a portion of shame for the fact that some people within our society feel they have to end their precious life because of whom they choose to love the theme of cork pride in is about celebrating heroes if the word hero encompasses the fact that behind the veil of each human being and hero is the reality that each carries his own flaws and shadows within the beautiful complexity of their interior world , that no human being or hero is ever a finished thing , that because of the vast expansiveness and boundless depth within their souls , we can only ever glimpse or know about a small portion of their life story , then we have many heroes in our midst , some well known public figures and others whose actions and deeds may never garner the headlines but whom touch people s lives in profound and meaningful ways david norris proved to be a beacon of light in a very dark ireland for many in years gone by and he has passed the torch he carried with such olympic endeavour in to the capable hands of jerry buttimer and john lyons whose proud voices ring true and loud around the hallowed halls of power in dail eireann ruairi quinn and alan shatter , with support from the fine gael and labour parties have furthered the cause of the minority during their terms in office eileen gamble bravely continues to highlight the plight of teachers whom can still lose their jobs because of whom they choose to love and colm o gorman s reasoned and measured points of view during many a debate in his pursuit of equality for married couples stirs the heart with joy rory o neill through the power and eloquence of his voice and the force and magic of his personality inspires all whom hear or watch him the many organisations like the other place in cork , glen and belongto continue to be sanctuaries of support and shelters of love , kindness and hope for many people where they can discover their own courage to be true to themselves donal og is a trailblazer for sportsmen the world over and the warm acceptance from his fellow players and the watershed speech from dublin footballer ger brennan from the steps of the hogan stand in croke park where he thanked the players girlfriends and boyfriends , sends out a potent message to all people in our society from the most powerful sporting organisation in the country that it s ok to be gay and certainly ok to be gay in the gaa all of these and many more continue to be rainbows in the cloud of discrimination , violence , inequality and intolerance that still engulf our country and world towards individuals in society when the artist gilbert baker designed the colours for the flag to represent pride back in , he chose well as discovered by newton , the colours of the rainbow , fashioned from the forces of nature deep in the universe , combine to produce the brilliant white light that brings life and beauty to all things on our planet we too have come from the stars and the white light , the oxygen we breathe , the carbon in our muscles , the calcium in our bones , the iron in our blood , all of them were forged from the fiery hearts of long vanished stars we are pilgrims on a voyage through an earthly plane , spiritual beings whom have stopped off on our cosmic journey to encounter each other , to meet , to love , to share the prism of life has split us all into different colours and forms but the rainbow and white light teaches us that none are more important or more equal than the other somewhere , deep in the caverns of our being , is the memory that we all come from the same source of white light , hetero or homosexual , christian or buddhist , male and female , catholic or protestant our quest surely is to remember and live out that truth during our time on earth there is a hunger and deep desire within every human heart that propels us to want to return home to the light of our real selves if we can , if we can reach the point where all spectrums of our people are valued equally and combine our beautiful complexities of colours together , the white light of truth and love will not only exist in the heavans but will radiate out on this earth for all of us to bask and dwell in the pride march is not just a march to represent individuals whom are labelled gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgender it s a march to represent all of humanity and its continued pursuit of equality and harmony for all i wish you all well on our continued journey together , home to the pure white light and beauty of our real selves this piece was initially written for the cork lgbt pride festival magazine for august
