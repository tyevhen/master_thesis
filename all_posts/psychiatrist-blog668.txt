a few days ago , i ranted about how i was detained by security at an airport , then lost my computer i 've put an update on the bottom of the that post my disasters , natural and otherwise so let me talk about my new friend , whom i 've never met and whom i know pretty much nothing about , steve silberman , blogger over on neurotribes now i 've never actually read much of neurotribes , and maybe he express opinions that would make me feel ill , but when one of our readers pointed out the post called dear united airlines i want my kindle and my dignity back , i felt like i had found a soul mate in my distress over my lost laptop and the frustration i have felt in trying to inspire some sense of caring or empathy from tsa or the airlines mr silberman writes the metaphor of frogs that don t notice the water around them is getting warmer until it s boiling and they re cooked is only an urban legend , say the vigilant debunkers at snopes com but it s an apt image for today s frequent flyers schlepping their carry ons through security mazes , standing shoeless with arms outstretched in bleeping machines , shrugging off dramatic confiscations of shampoo and toothpaste , and frantically rejiggering carefully plotted itineraries at a moment s notice , we ve come to accept the current state of affairs as just another way that life sucks in the post era never mind that i m old enough to recall when a cross country trip on an airplane , even in economy class , offered an opportunity to unwind and feel coddled in the lap of luxury for a few hours with a stratospheric view now i look forward to flying about as much as i look forward to a trip to the dentist okay , steve , it was nice to meet you my disasters , natural and otherwise , now updated
