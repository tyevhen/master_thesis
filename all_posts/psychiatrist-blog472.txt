join me for a brief clink rant over at clinical psychiatry news as i provide a counterpoint argument to people who think that med check practices are destroying psychiatry i 'd like people to acknowledge that all medication management practices are not the same and that it is possible to provide good care while working in a split treatment or team model with health care reform on the horizon , more practices psychiatric and otherwise are going to have to move to the medical home model and this is likely to require closer involvement with non psychiatrist therapists medication management is here to stay , the team approach works , and more psychiatrists are likely to be involved in it psychiatry needs to adapt and it helps no one to paint all med management with the same negative brush thanks for listening , i feel better
