life has been cruising along at break neck speed i'm sorry i 've been absent from this blog for several days i do n't like doing that i feel a responsibility to all of you to keep up keeping up with my speedy life has been a little tough , but i'm certainly not bored ! work has had a bit of drama , and that 's always tiring unfortunately , two of our team members have separated themselves by being disrespectful to many of us , including my boss they have a different boss even though they are part of our team in our office it 's a little bizarre that way for some reason , they seem to feel they have a right to behave as they see fit because they do n't share our boss and their behavior lately has been less than professional it 's too bad we have a great office with great people i ca n't figure out what they 're thinking i do n't think they realize that their behavior reflects poorly on them rather than on the staff they are disrespecting it 's been a little stressful , as my boss tries to deal with them other than that stress , work has been great i 've got a full load of patients now , and i'm very busy it 's testing my energy limits for example , i did n't get to work out until after pm last night , and that was after working hours getting on a bike was the last thing i wanted to do , but i did n't want to skip a day after training so hard for so many weeks now so i went to the gym and rode my little heart out for minutes of course , i was glad i did as usual , i felt better physically and mentally once done today , i ran a mile tempo run in between doctor appointments , meetings , and errands it was a great run difficult , but great i maintained my pace throughout it was a gorgeous day and my form felt decent , even when i was tired it was all good i'm planning to run a half marathon next saturday , so it was nice to get a decent , fast run under my belt beforehand my training is going so well , and yet i'm still not sure i 'll have the funds to travel to dallas for the marathon in december i'm going to keep training as if i 'll be running it , continue running some local races , and hopefully have the funding when the time comes the race is december th , so i have a little more time to prepare even if i do n't run the race , however , the training is serving me well so it 's worth it there i think you 're all caught up i'm considering increasing my work hours , but i 'll leave that discussion for a future post have a great day
