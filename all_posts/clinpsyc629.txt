the new england journal of medicine published another study from the catie group , this time testing second generation aka sga or atypical antipsychotic medications on patients with alzheimer s disease let s start off by quoting the authors conclusion from the abstract adverse effects offset advantages in the efficacy of atypical antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of psychosis , aggression , or agitation in patients with alzheimer s disease olanzapine zyprexa , risperidone risperdal , and quetiapine seroquel showed no significant advantage as a group combining the three medications into one group over placebo in efficacy on the primary outcome measure , the clinical global impressions improvement scale of patients on olanzapine were rated as having at least minimal improvement compared to for quetiapine , for risperidone , and for placebo when comparing olanzapine to placebo , the difference is statistically significant barely , with p the authors did not report effect size differences , but across the cgi i , neuropsychiatric inventory , and brief psychiatric rating scale , they appear to all be in about the ish range according to my mental calculations based on reported means and standard deviations , suggesting very modest improvement for drug versus placebo another important measure was discontinuation of treatment overall , there was not a significant difference between placebo and medication on how frequently treatment was discontinued by clinicians how about safety ? over weeks , of both the olanzapine and risperidone groups gained over of their body weight , compared to of placebo patients all medications resulted in significantly greater increase in body mass index compared to placebo both olanzapine and risperidone were significantly more likely to cause extrapyramidal symptoms compared to placebo remember that one reason sgas were supposedly superior to older antipsychotic meds was because sgas would cause extrapyramidal symptoms at a very low rate hmmm thank you nimh for funding this study ! the bad news continues to flow about second generation antipsychotics link to the study abstract here feel free to read more about atypical antipsychotics here , here , here , and here
