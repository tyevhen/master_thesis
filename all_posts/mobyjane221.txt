dear ms curtiss my depression keeps me fear from finding a job i sometimes say how the employer will let me work if he knew or notice my case i need help for this thoughts thanks r dear r , in the first place there are probably million people in this country who are depressed some times make that million you are no different from everybody else we all get depressed now and then some people just get out of it faster that 's the only difference , some people get out of their depression faster they can do that because they notice that first downer thought and zap it before it gets going good on their mood depression is much easing to zap when you make yourself aware of the downer shift right away the other difference is that some people who get depressed behave as if they are depressed they sigh a lot , and look sad , and speak in a weak sad voice the also put out their anger on other people others have decided that , even though they may be depressed at the moment , they will not behave in a depressed manner they will be cheerful , and mindful of others , and look for ways to feel better by connecting with other people they will continue to concentrate on their work instead of their depression , and think about what they are doing and not think about feeling bad if you manage your behavior well , your depression need not keep you from doing well on the job go for it a b curtiss
