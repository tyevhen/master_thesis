one complaint i heard someone make recently , in the context of javascript not having a true inheritance model , is that there is no super in javascript somebody , in a forum somewhere , actually whined and moaned about not being able to call super i believe the whiner was a java programmer there should n't be a super in java , either , though that 's the real issue i'm flabbergasted that anyone thinks super is a meaningful thing to have to write , in any language what could be more obscure and arcane than super ? it 's totally cryptic it 's shorthand for go invoke a method of my parent that i happen to have intimate knowledge of never mind the side effects , i'm clairvoyant enough to understand all that , even if my parent 's concrete implementation changed without my knowing it i thought secret knowledge and hidden dependencies were supposed to be evil
