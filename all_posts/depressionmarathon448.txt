i'm unhappy with my weight despite solid weeks of training , i'm gaining weight i'm a good pounds above where i feel my best six pounds may not seem like a lot , but it is quite a bit on a runner unfortunately , or perhaps fortunately , the primary reason i'm heavy is i'm eating way too much chocolate i love chocolate loving chocolate is not actually the problem the problem is once i start eating chocolate , i keep eating chocolate it 's eerily familiar to my response to alcohol one piece of chocolate leads to another and another and another like last night , despite my good intentions to have just one piece , i continued eating piece after piece after piece i do n't like it as i said , it reminds me of my response to alcohol it makes me feel out of control , and that makes me uncomfortable for this reason , i know better than to buy chocolate i know i ca n't have it in my house if it 's here , i eat it until it is gone , and then i feel bad about it despite this knowledge , i 've been buying chocolate , and eating it , a lot lately why ? i do n't know it 's probably some sort of self destructive tendency i should discuss with my therapist i suppose but until i do that , i'm discussing it with you i'm admitting it to you , because i 've made a decision i'm temporarily going off chocolate i think i 'll feel better physically and mentally without it , without the temptation of it it 's going to be difficult i am the queen of rationalization in fact running is one of my primary rationalizations ! i'm also frequently around chocolate , especially at work i'm actually expecting fresh brownies in the office tomorrow morning i love brownies i do n't know how long this will last i'm shooting for at least one month tomorrow will be day one i feel like i need to do something drastic to get myself back on a healthier track , and trust me , not eating chocolate is drastic ! i 'll let you know how it goes and whether the effort turns out to be worth it or not hopefully it will be worth something more than just torture
