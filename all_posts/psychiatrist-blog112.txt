there 's a article in the new york times by jaime lowe titled , i do n't believe in god , but i believe in lithium i had no idea the two were mutually exclusive or even had anything to do with one another ! the title aside , i liked the article lowe describes devastating bouts of psychotic mania , and how lithium enables her to lead a functional and productive life , with mental illness held at bay until her renal function starts to tank lowe writes i wanted a calmer life so for the next years , i took my three pink capsules and all was well i wrote a book , i learned how to cook in an italian restaurant kitchen , i had a few relationships that lasted longer than a month , i wrote , i boxed , i traveled , i painted , i took my pills i was fine then , last fall , i saw my primary physician and he sent me to the nearest emergency room he was alarmed at my combination of high creatinine levels , damaged kidneys and heart attack level blood pressure at mount sinai hospital , my doctor s fears were confirmed in a matter of days my kidneys were irreparably damaged , an uncommon but not rare side effect of long term lithium use i was told i could phase out lithium and start another medication , or face dialysis and a kidney transplant in years it doesn t really feel like an obvious choice it just feels like two bad options switching meds might mean the return of cornrowed , eminem obsessed jamya and many seasonal gourds yet tubing up and cleansing my blood until i get a stranger s kidney quilted into the rest of my insides is hardly more appealing test results indicate that my kidneys are working about half as well as they should maria devita , a nephrologist at lenox hill hospital , told me that if i am to switch to preserve the kidney function i have left , the time to strike is now wishing her luck coming off , and i hope it turns out that there is a third and fourth option that work as well for her
