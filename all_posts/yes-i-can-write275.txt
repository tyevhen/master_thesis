i wrote this review for homeschooling horizons magazine a year or two ago , and since i 've been wanting to share reviews of unschooling books , i decided to post it here ! in the end , the secret to learning is so simple think only about whatever you love follow it , do it , dream about it and it will hit you learning was there all the time , happening by itself grace llewellyn the teenage liberation handbook how to quit school and get a real life and education by grace llewellyn this has to be the most inspiring book i ve ever read i m actually at a bit of a loss for just how to get across how amazing i found this book i suppose i should start with how it affected me personally i ve always been an unschooler , and i read some of this book years ago , but the last year i was seriously questioning the path that my education had taken was i doing the right thing ? should i really be in school instead ? or at least studying textbooks ? then i picked up the teenage liberation handbook once again , and my worries melted away here in my hands i held a virtual goldmine of ideas , resources , encouragement , and practical advice written with passion and conviction , liberally peppered with stories of real life teenage unschoolers and the marvelous things they ve done least fascinatingly to me getting into prestigious universities , but that means a lot to some people , and continuously inspiring although aimed directly at teenagers still in the school system , with advice on convincing your parents that unschooling can work , to legal issues , to worries about socialization , i found it equally useful as an unschooler , with such wide ranging chapters giving ideas for things you can do for every traditional school subject , and some less traditional ones , as well as getting into colleges and universities , finding meaningful volunteer and paid work , doing apprenticeships , starting your own business , traveling the world if ever you thought unschooling couldn t work , or you simply need to be inspired , then this is the book for you i feel like i ve started my own education all over again i m actually exited about learning for the first time in a while good job grace ! grace does have some very strong opinions since i agree with most of them , it wasn t a problem for me , but it may be for some people that s the only even possibly negative thing i can say about the whole book ! read it love it and most importantly , love learning peace , idzie you might also like review of for the sake of our children review of reasons why i'm an unschooler problems review of a rule is to break a child 's guide to anarchy linkwithin
