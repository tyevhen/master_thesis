did anyone watch the president 's address to congress last night about the health care plan he has come up with ? i thought it was extremely interesting one of the reasons i still have to work is because my husband 's job does n't offer insurance for their employees , but mine does when we made the switch to using my company 's insurance , i was really interested in getting the short term disability coverage until i saw a warning that said it did n't cover anxiety disorders when i had my last week long anxiety battle , i had to take the whole week off sick because i could hardly function so i was really disappointed that anxiety was n't covered in the short term disability insurance plan so i did n't get it luckily my company has offered unlimited sick time so i will just stick with that but i think its rare for companies to offer that now a days while we were switching the insurance over , my anxiety meds cost me bucks a month without my insurance with it , its only dollars a month just for the zoloft i ca n't imagine someone that does n't have health insurance and living with anxiety which i am sure there are many many people out there in this situation getting by i'm sure they suffer more than anyone because they ca n't afford treatment , whether it be doctor visits , therapy , medication , whatever so i am excited for the idea of changing how the system works i know there are many pros and cons and the debate could go on forever and people feel very passionate about this subject but i am just glad its changing because i do n't think it can get much worse than it currently is what are your thoughts on the health care system as it is and how has it affected your treatment ? what do you hope to see change ? aimee if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like can you be declined life insurance because of anxiety ? pharmacists might care after all world mental health day chronic stress more belly fat ! ? ! linkwithin
