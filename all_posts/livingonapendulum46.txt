hello all ! i wanted to let you all know what has been going on in my life lately , preventing me from posting as often as usual oh i know i have managed to write up some ranting posts but that is not sharing like i usually do or is it ? the first is that for the last month or so , i have been doing different kinds of stuff at work i started the second week of june it 's an accommodation where i am interacting less with the public but doing more of other kinds of work i have written my blog during my breaks and yes sometimes during calls mostly formatting during calls but now the nature of my work makes it almost impossible to blog between yes i still get breaks , but during the breaks i don t feel much like typing and i often have other things to do to give my mind a rest i am in the process of being assessed for accommodation at work this is only a temporary assignment until a more permanent or long term solution can be found at the same time i was hoping that this process would give my family doctor a better idea of the challenges i face everyday and might make him open to working with me to find something that works unfortunately , everyone is focusing on the symptoms of my mind and no one is paying attention to the symptoms f my body there were a few close calls there but they did not delve enough and long enough to help long term so at work i ca n't post much at home i have another situation for the last week and a half , one of my foster kittens has been sick and required a lot of care i have been lucky in that my daughter has been helping me with some of his care while i am at work and at night as i really need my sleep as you know this kitten bam bam has been taking a lot of my time and attention that my housework , and other past times have been affected bam bam has not been eating well , he 's lost weight , we had managed to make him regain some and it was looking well , but he 's stopped eating again his right eye has an infection that just does not seem to be going away you ca n't see it very well in the first two pictures but see the rd picture the infection now seems to be spreading to his second eye we have been to the vet twice , he has had subcutaneous fluids once but has remained hydrated i have been taught to give the fluids just in case he is not as lethargic as he was the first few days he was even trying to play with my camera strap during the last picture so most of the pictures i took were blurry he is on metronidazole and the drug seems to keep him somewhat better than he was initially so bam bam was not eating , not it 's hit and miss , we need to start force feeding him every hour again was not drinking , but is drinking on his own now so i do not have to administer fluids has mild diarrhea off and on has thrown up but does n't seem to be doing so now we are keeping a close eye on that was lethargic he still has less energy that the other kittens but is doing better our other cats are feeling a little ignored and the fish and hamsters are definitely being ignored we fear that we may not save him , we hope we will of course i have not been doing so well they asked me how recovered i was yesterday , i gave a grade of i figure is coma , is uber healthy so that 's what 's been going on thanks for reading and hope to come back soon with better news http photos petfinder com photos ca on on on pn jpg
