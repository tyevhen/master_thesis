hi all ! i'm afraid not much has happened worth noting this week maybe that 's a good thing the ren festival was a lot of fun , and i really enjoyed watching willy wonka and blazing saddles in the theater this was my last week of hands on training for work , and i 'll really miss some of the patients that i met at the facility i was training at but i wo n't miss the negative attitude that the employees there have they are downright mean to some of the patients , and tend to break hippa by talking about the patients in front of other patients they are particularly mean to one patient who is the sweetest guy ever i do n't see why , since his only problem is that he has dementia and tends to ask the same question over and over one of the girls said she does n't like him because he milks the dementia ! i felt really bad saying bye to him , since he seemed so genuinely sad that i was going and said but you 're so nice ! however , i'm happy to be moving on with work and becoming independent i have one week of book learning to do before that happens i finished two books this week , why zebras do n't get ulcers , by robert m sapolsky , and the ear , the eye , and the arm by nancy farmer i'm currently reading to kill a mockingbird , by harper lee , stiletto , by daniel o'malley book club choice , and i 'll read the myth of sisyphus and other essays for national suicide prevention month i 've written one book review since my return from blogging hibernation last week red queen , by victoria aveyard i 've decided to commit to one book for rip xi this year rip xi stainless steel droppings image courtesy of abigail larson i'm having trouble deciding which book i 'll imbibe in the fifth child , by doris lessing or beloved , by toni morrison both are written by nobel prize winners , and i 've enjoyed reading both authors in the past any suggestions ?
