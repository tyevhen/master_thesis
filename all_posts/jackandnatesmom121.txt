god , that is because some strange things have been happening this afternoon and by strange , i mean good , which feels strange after my recent frustrations about minutes after i posted this morning , the pharmacy called to let me know that everything with the mitochondrial cocktail is set , they are formulating it and will send the day supply shortly score one for us ! then , about minutes after that , the nih called i kid you not this is the first time they have called in the years since i put nate on the study list i called back and left a message , but unfortunately have not spoken with a person yet all i know is that she is with the neuroscience department who knows if we d even be interested as i stated in a previous post , i am no longer drawn to studies that provide researchers with general information about autism symptoms and progression regression remission if i had all the time in the world it would be another story , but clearly , i don t i also don t think it s fair to nate , or our family , to subject him to the same assessments over and over again , when they always yield the same results it s depressing , it s time consuming , and it certainly doesn t benefit him in any way my requirements for study participation at this point have changed i will not enroll either of the boys in a study unless a it involves pharmacological intervention that looks promising or b it yields some new , useful information for my son an eeg i would do , an mri i would do these procedures might explain something , and that , to me , is worth it basically , even though it sounds a little selfish , there has to be something in it for us the timing of this call just cracked me up it s likely that nothing will come of this , and even if it does i doubt it will yield answered prayers it s nice to think that god is looking out for my son she has given nate quite a heavy load to carry , and he could use a break and mommy and daddy could too
