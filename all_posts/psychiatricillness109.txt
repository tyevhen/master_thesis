i use the tv , dvds and soaps to hide from the way i am feeling the last few nights when the lights have gone out when all i can hear is the clock ticking , the cat purring and next doors tv i realise how alone i am in this depressing world this tme yesterday i could not see my way through today now i at least have a plan for tomorrow and maybe after that i will be able to see my way through the week and to the christmas break ! i hate turning the lights out !
