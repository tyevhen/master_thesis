it seems so ridiculous to say this , but think about it when people do stupid things and say i do n't know what i was thinking in those days , it should remind us that if we do n't put ideas in our brain , they wo n't be there for us to use to ensure that your brain comes up with better and better solutions for the problems in your life , you must constantly be programming helpful information into your memory banks that you can draw upon later this is why education is so important this is why it s important to have solid ethical and courageous principles that you can draw self support from suppose , for instance you have a weight problem you re at a meeting and overhear someone say that you re fat sure , you can get upset and hate the skinny person who called you fat you can withdraw from the group in anger and fear you can blame everybody for being cold and uncaring or you can ask yourself , what can i do to help myself in this embarrassing and adverse situation ? you can always turn from your emotional brain and put your thinking brain to work it will help if , ahead of time , you have previously programmed into your memory banks the principle that it is a good thing to strive constantly to be a better person it will help if you have already programmed into your memory banks what kind of food is more nutritious and less fattening so you could decide , then and there , to start eating carrots instead of potato chips it will help if you have programmed into your memory banks the principle that negative emotion should never be an option , that self denial of things that aren t good for you is a good thing , that embarrassing situations are good for one s character and one is a stronger person to have suffered and survived than never to have suffered at all it will help you for the rest of your life if you will program into your thinking brain right this minute that you can call upon it and it will always come up with some positive alternative to anxiety , anger and fear
