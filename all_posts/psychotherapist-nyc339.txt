as i mentioned in an earlier article , the trauma of everyday life the buddha 's loss of his mother , i recently finished reading mark epstein 's book , the trauma of everyday life one of the themes in his book is that trauma and suffering are a part of everyone 's life and there 's no way to avoid it dr epstein discusses how buddha came to accept trauma as something that happened to everyone and , rather than try to avoid dealing with it , it 's better to deal with the emotions through mindfulness buddha 's first noble truth life is suffering buddha 's first noble truth life is suffering according to dr epstein , buddhist philosophy centers around buddha 's four noble truths the first noble truth is that life is suffering according to the first noble truth , we ca n't live life without enduring some type of suffering , whether it 's physical , emotional , psychological and , ultimately , death it 's understandable that no one wants to suffer , and most people are inclined to try to avoid dealing with their unpleasant feelings but when we try to completely avoid dealing with suffering , the effect is usually that we prolong it we can find all different ways to try to distract ourselves from our suffering , and we have many more ways now than ever before the internet , tv , smart phones , computer games , etc but no matter how much we try to avoid emotions related to suffering , the feelings are still there working through trauma in therapy many people are afraid to go to therapy because they fear that they wo n't be able to tolerate dealing with their emotional trauma rather than dealing with trauma in therapy , they keep pushing down their uncomfortable feelings so they do n't have to deal with them often , by pushing down these feelings , the feelings actually intensify and get worse aside from distracting themselves , some people try to alter their mood by drinking excessively , using drugs , gambling or engaging in other mood altering activities this only creates more problems for them creating a safe place in therapy to deal with trauma when a psychotherapy client has a good rapport with the therapist and the therapist creates an emotionally safe place , the client is often surprised that the working through of trauma can be less painful than they expected see my article the creation of the holding environment in psychotherapy why is this often the case ? well , people who have been emotionally traumatized expect that they will feel as badly in the working through process as they did when they experienced the original trauma but , often , during the original trauma the client had to deal with the trauma by him or herself even if there were other people around who wanted to help , they might not have known how to help creating a safe place in therapy to deal with trauma also , if you 're working with a therapist who has an expertise in trauma , the therapist usually knows how to titrate the working through process so that it can be worked through in a way that is more manageable for the client this does n't mean that the client wo n't feel upset it means that , with help from an experienced trauma therapist , the client can work through the trauma so that they usually do n't experience the same anguish they did during the original trauma an experienced trauma therapist can also help the client to separate emotions from the original trauma versus emotions that he or she feels now see my article working through emotional trauma learning to separate then from now this is very important because many people assume that they 'll be retraumatized in therapy getting help in therapy the first step in working through trauma is getting help from a licensed mental health professional who is a trauma expert getting help in therapy my experience as a psychotherapist , who has an expertise in working with trauma , is that regular talk therapy does n't always help people to heal from trauma and a mind body oriented approach to trauma , like emdr , somatic experience or clinical hypnosis is often more effective emotional trauma can lie dormant for a while before it is triggered by an event in the present then , it 's often hard to distinguish between the old trauma and the current event if you 've been avoiding dealing with your emotional trauma , you probably realize that it 's not going away by itself so , you owe it to yourself to get help so you can work through the trauma and lead a more fulfilling life about me i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist who works with individual adults and couples one of my specialties is helping clients to overcome emotional trauma to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at or email me josephineolivia aol com
