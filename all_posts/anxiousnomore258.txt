photo by karl eschenbach setbacks are extremely hard for me it takes me days to a week to get over them sometimes i feel so over my head there is too much to do and i ca n't remember it all , i ca n't control my body i feel like sometimes i can handle my anxiety , and then many days i can not so this morning when i woke up and anxiety hit my stomach the moment my eyes opened as it has for the last several weeks , i broke down i sat shaking in the shower , balling , not sure how i would ever make it to work feeling such a loss of control over my own body something needed to be done i was worried about how taking another sick day off of work would effect my job , but i knew i could n't go to work in the emotional state i was in so i faced the facts i am in over my head my health is more important than my job i spent the day working with my insurance company to find a counselor that i could talk to i was able to catch an appointment that afternoon i was so excited to speak with someone that could help me i left my house minutes early just in case i got lost because i am extremely directionally challeged just my luck , not enough time i have never gotten more lost in my life i finally showed up only minutes late ! i was soo frazzled after almost getting into car accidents and one pull off to cry i could hardly make it up the steps without tripping over myself i'm sure the counselor thought i was a mess since i was so late we only got to chat for about minutes , but it was nice she was a little older and very calm and relaxing to talk to very motherly i have great hopes that she will be able to help me where i ca n't seem to keep up you might also like dealing with unexpected anxiety setbacks they 're here how stress affects the body theres no need to push myself linkwithin
