i will not die an unlived life i will not live in fear of falling or catching fire i choose to inhabit my days , to allow my living to open me , to make me less afraid , more accessible , to loosen my heart until it becomes a wing , a torch , a promise i choose to risk my significance to live so that which comes to me as seed goes to the next as blossom and that which comes to me as blossom , goes on as fruit dawna markova if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like cool quote alert an update to get you through the day great quote alert spoiler alert ! giveaway coming really soon ! linkwithin
