i just finished reading dr gary small 's book , the naked lady who stood on her head i talked about it during our podcast , and maybe , someday , that podcast will be posted in the final chapter of the book , dr small talks about his mentor , friend , and father figure who has been mentioned throughout the book the mentor approaches him on the golf course , where they meet to talk , and says he needs psychotherapy and gary is the man to do it the author is surprised , hesitant , and a bit uncomfortable with the demand it comes as more than a request his wife likens it to the need for a plumber or a dentist , and dr small takes on the task the mentor calls all the shots where the meetings will be , what pastry they will eat , the form of his payment the author initially misses the diagnosis and uses this as an example of how one can be blinded so is it okay for a friend to treat a friend ? i was in an institution where the resounding feeling is that psychiatric disorders are medical diseases like any other the patient should go where the care is best obviously , our institution gave the best care , and so there was no taboo about faculty being treated or even hospitalized within the department this is not to say that everyone treated their friends , but people might not move their care as far away as one might imagine and sometimes people treated their friends at the same time , the standard professional boundaries suggest that friends should not treat friends , and that such arrangements are not kosher , especially after the fact if the treatment is called in to question dr small talks about a delay in diagnosis he does n't talk about the fact that the patient here is dictating the care in a way we generally do n't view as being helpfu to patients even vip patients or that the desire to please authority figures can be very powerful regarding the my three shrinks podcast we 've decided that i , the non geek , should try to produce the podcasts for the near future roy said he 'd rather stick a fork in his eye than teach me to do this clink is trying , but even the process of transferring the recordings to my computer has been rough , not to mention that our podcast programs do n't sync soon we hope
