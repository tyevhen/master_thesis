in my last article , i discussed the topic of how psychotherapists' self disclosure affects the relationship with clients as i mentioned in that post , boundary violations between psychotherapists and clients often begin on the slippery slope with inappropriate self disclosure by the therapist in this article , i will focus on when boundary violations occur where there is sexual exploitation of clients by their psychotherapists what are boundaries in psychotherapy ? the term boundaries in psychotherapy is a metaphorical term that refers to the definition and professional structure of the psychotherapy relationship it defines the psychotherapeutic relationship as being different from a personal relationship or a friendship the boundaries of the psychotherapeutic relationship include , but are not limited to , the time that the psychotherapist and client spend together in a professional setting , the fee arrangement , the psychotherapist 's self disclosure , the type and frequency of between session phone calls , the prohibitions with regard to physical touch , and other related issues the purpose of maintaining appropriate professional boundaries in psychotherapy is , first and foremost , to protect the client from inappropriate behavior by the therapist which can be psychologically harmful secondly , maintaining appropriate professional boundaries also protects the therapist with regard to accusations of unethical and illegal behavior which could result in malpractice lawsuits , professional sanctions and , in the worst cases , revocation of professional licenses and or arrests as i mentioned in my prior article , it is always the therapist 's responsibility to maintain appropriate professional boundaries in treatment , regardless of whatever the client might do or the type of therapy how often do boundary violations occur in psychotherapeutic relationships ? it is difficult to come up with accurate numbers because many boundary violations , especially sexual exploitation , are not reported many clients feel ashamed and blame themselves for the boundary violations most boundary violations occur with male therapists who are older , more established , and also well trained this is not to say that boundary violations never occur with female psychotherapists however , based on available data , it seems to be less prevalent in the us , it is estimated that nearly half of all malpractice suits are related to psychotherapists' sexual exploitation of clients and most of these suits are against psychiatrists the good news is that these type of boundary violations seem to have decreased somewhat over the years , possibly due to stiffer penalties , professional sanctions , refusal of malpractice insurance companies to provide insurance to therapists who have transgressed with clients , and better training while this is good news , even one boundary violation between a therapist and a client is one too many non sexual boundary violations that can lead down the slippery slope to sexual exploitation excessive self disclosure see prior blog post dual relationships most mental health professionals' codes of ethics prohibit dual relationships because it is recognized that this is usually harmful for the client the psychotherapeutic relationship should be the only relationship between therapist and client even when the dual relationship is not sexual , it violates the professional boundary between therapist and client for instance , if a therapist has a client who happens to be stock broker , the therapist should not ask the client for stock market advice and , it goes without saying , that the therapist should n't ask the client to handle his or her money for stock market transactions once the professional boundaries have been breached , the treatment is placed at risk for even greater boundary violations too many unnecessary phone calls between sessions while most therapists recognize the necessity of some phone calls between sessions to reschedule appointments or to help clients who are in a particular crisis , most therapists also know that too many unnecessary phone calls between sessions should be explored during in person sessions with the client needless to say , i'm not talking about clients who are home bound or sick and have phone sessions with their therapists rather , i'm referring to clients who might not understand the professional treatment frame and who want to treat their therapist like a friend as in all of these examples , it 's up to the therapist to address the issue and set appropriate limits therapist 's failure to maintain the treatment frame while it is understood that there are times when certain clients might need extra time in a therapy session due to a crisis or they might need a temporary fee agreement due to financial necessity , when the therapist fails to maintain the treatment frame on a frequent basis with a particular client , this is usually indicative of the therapist 's boundary violation in the treatment , which might be conscious or unconscious on the therapist 's part i often work with clients on a sliding scale basis , when i have available open slots to do so i have also extended my services to longstanding clients on a pro bono basis for a limited amount of time when they 've lost their jobs however , in all these instances , i 've carefully considered the particular circumstances of the client and the nature of our professional relationship to make sure that i'm not enacting a boundary violation by giving special treatment to certain clients if it 's clear that a client can afford to pay the full fee , i see no reason to provide a sliding scale fee and i would see this as an unprofessional enactment with the client touching or frequent hugs as a matter of course , i do not touch my clients i am very aware that , for many clients , touching has particular inappropriate implications , especially for clients who were sexually abused , and even more so in cases of incest the therapeutic relationship can often take on the appearance and feeling of a parent child relationship it 's very important for the client to feel that he or she can trust the therapist no matter how non hierarchical or egalitarian a therapist might try to be , the client therapist relationship is , by definition , an unequal relationship where the therapist has more power than the client even in therapy relationships where the client is a therapist like most examples , there are some limited exceptions at the conclusion of a long term therapy relationship , many clients spontaneously hug their therapists this is usually an expression of their gratitude and caring for the therapist while i do n't initiate these hugs , i would not hurt a client 's feelings by trying to ward off a hug under these circumstances the problems with touching and frequent hugs is that they can easily develop into more inappropriate seductive touching of an intimate or sexual nature , once again , crossing the therapeutic boundaries of treatment the above list is certainly not exhaustive , but it represents some of the more common non sexual boundary violations that often lead to sexual boundary violations to illustrate the points that i have made above , the following fictionalized account is an example of a sexual boundary violation between a psychotherapist and his client betty began attending psychotherapy sessions with dr smith after she lost the third job in a row for getting sexually involved with her supervisor dr smith was highly recommended to her by a friend as a psychiatrist who was both a psychotherapist and psychopharmacologist betty , who was in her mid s , had never been in therapy before , so she did n't know what to expect dr smith talked to her about what would be expected of her with regard to the treatment frame i e , coming to sessions regularly and on time , paying fees in a timely manner , the length of treatment sessions , and other related issues he also talked to her about his professional obligations with her after several sessions , betty began to have erotic feelings for dr smith , which is not unusual in psychotherapy this is often part of clients' transferential feelings for their therapist most of the time , these tranferential feelings have little to do with the therapist and more to do with the client 's underlying , unconscious issues betty tended to be seductive in her relationships with most people , including her professors , work supervisors and other authority figures in her life at that point in the therapy , she was unaware of how she attempted to sexualize her relationships so , it was not surprising when she began to come to therapy with revealing , low cut blouses and short skirts when dr smith addressed and explored this seductive behavior in therapy , betty was n't sure how to respond to this in the past , due to her seductive nature and the fact that she was extremely attractive , most people responded to her seduction by engaging in sex with her although she usually felt powerful at first , these sexual encounters ended up being emotional disasters for her it was the cause of many problems for her in college as well as in her work relationships with supervisors as the therapy progressed , it came to light that betty had been sexually abused by her maternal uncle from the time that she was until she was in her late teens according to betty , it began with inappropriate touching and progressed to sexual intercourse when she was in her teens as an only child of a single , alcoholic mother , betty craved attention and she was easy prey for her uncle , who lived with betty and her mother although she felt that her uncle 's sexual attention was wrong , she was vulnerable to him because she was an emotionally neglected child she also told herself that she must be special for her uncle to want to spend time with her in this way , so she never told anyone about it the only reason that the incest stopped was because as betty got older , her uncle , who turned out to be a pedophile with other children too , no longer found her sexually exciting as is often the case with pedophiles , he needed to enact his sexual transgressions with children so he stopped approaching betty in a sexual manner and , even though she attempted to seduce him back into their incestuous relationship to get his attention , he abandoned her , presumably , for a younger child having been sexually violated at such a young age , betty learned to sexualize most of her relationships with men when she wanted attention as a result , she continued to enact the sexual transgressions as an adult but , instead of being the one who was seduced , she took on the role of the sexual aggressor , albeit with adults and not children , to continue to get attention and gratify her emotional needs when dr smith did not respond to her sexually provocative clothing in session , she began calling him between sessions to chat dr smith responded to her calls by telling her that , unless she had an urgent matter or she needed to change an appointment time , she should wait for their next therapy session to talk to him undeterred , betty began leaving frequent voicemail messages for dr smith late at night , letting him know that she was thinking of him and could n't wait to see him again at that point , dr smith consulted with his former , more experienced clinical supervisor to get clinical advice on how to handle this client his supervisor knew dr smith well and knew him to be an ethical psychiatrist however , he also knew that dr smith was going through a tumultuous divorce , he was lonely , and he could be vulnerable to betty 's seduction he reminded dr smith of his professional and ethical obligations under their professional code of conduct then , he asked dr smith about his countertransferential feelings for betty dr smith admitted to his supervisor that he found betty very attractive and sexually tantalizing , as most men probably would however , he told his supervisor that he did n't want to cross the professional boundary with this client dr smith 's supervisor told him that if he could work out this issue with betty , it could be an important breakthrough in her treatment and she could deal with the original incest rather than continuing to engage in sexual enactments however , he also told him that if he thought that he might violate the therapist client professional boundaries with betty , he should refer her to another therapist , preferably a woman dr smith 's supervisor knew that dr smith had a narcissistic streak to his personality , and he assured him that referring the client to another therapist would not be considered a professional failure rather , it would be a wise move to protect the client and to protect himself from crossing the professional boundary , especially at a time when dr smith was in so much emotional turmoil himself and he was feeling lonely dr smith agreed to consider the wise advice of his clinical supervisor he knew that he actually felt more tempted than he admitted to his supervisor to breach the professional boundaries of the relationship , but he also knew that he would perceive himself as a failure in this case if he referred betty to a colleague , and he was determined to work through the transferential and countertransferential issues in this case as treatment continued , betty continued to be seductive with dr smith the more he attempted to maintain the treatment frame , the more determined she appeared to be to violate it he attempted to talk to betty about her uncle 's sexual abuse , but she would find ways to bring the conversation back to her erotic feelings for dr smith during that same time , dr smith was feeling increasing emotional pressure from his divorce proceedings , which became nasty and heated he was receiving email messages from his wife telling him that she thought he was less than a man and he was spineless his lawyer encouraged him to settle on his wife 's demands and put the whole thing behind him , but dr smith did n't want to give up the battle this resulted in many sleepless nights , poor appetite , and the beginning of his isolation from friends , family and colleagues within a few months , he felt like an emotional wreck he knew that he should probably take a short sabbatical from his private practice , but he did n't want to admit that he needed a rest , so he continued to see clients , including betty at the end of a particularly difficult week where he had gotten very little sleep and he was emotionally and physically exhausted , dr smith saw betty for her usual weekly session as usual , she was wearing a sexually provocative outfit and she talked to him about her erotic feelings for him whereas in the past , she limited herself to telling him that she was turned on by him and would like to have sex with him , this time , she was more sexually explicit dr smith felt himself getting sexually aroused , but he maintained his professional demeanor however , by the end of the session , when dr smith and betty stood up for her to leave , she locked the door and began kissing him on the mouth emotionally depleted by his personal problems , dr smith gave in to betty 's sexual advances during that session by the time betty left , dr smith began to panic and he called his clinical supervisor for an emergency session his clinical supervisor met with dr smith , reprimanded him for violating the client therapist boundary , and told him that he needed to apologize to betty and tell her that he could no longer see her and he would refer her to a female therapist he told him take a sabbatical from his private practice , seek his own personal therapy to deal with this transgression and with his overwhelming personal problems , and consult with a malpractice attorney in case betty took action against him he also told dr smith that he was obligated to report this sexual exploitation to their ethics board who would investigate the case in addition , he told dr smith that if he did not agree to follow all of these recommendations , he would also report that to their professional ethics board immediately and advocate for his license to be suspended dr smith felt a lot of remorse for crossing the client therapist boundary he knew that , regardless of his personal problems and regardless of how seductive betty was , as a mental health professional , he was responsible for maintaining the professional boundary between them when he apologized to betty and told her that he could not see her again , she was crushed this boundary violation and termination of treatment represented a repetition of her earlier problems with her uncle dr smith referred betty to a seasoned female colleague , admitting that he had violated the therapeutic relationship and expressing his remorse over time , betty was able to work through the sexual exploitation in her therapeutic relationship with dr smith as well as the original incest with her uncle it was not easy or quick , and betty also tested the professional boundaries with the new therapist however , ultimately , her therapy was a success dr smith took a sabbatical from his private practice he entered into his own personal therapy to deal with the boundary violation as well as his divorce and loneliness he also consulted with a malpractice attorney after long and careful consideration , he decided to change his career focus from his psychotherapy private practice to psychotherapy research as this fictionalized scenario demonstrates , even when the psychotherapist is determined to maintain professional boundaries and seeks out clinical supervision to deal with the erotic transference and countertransference , there are so many personal and professional factors that can jeopardize a treatment psychotherapists need to be emotionally attuned to their own professional and personal vulnerabilities before they slide down the slippery slope of crossing boundaries with a client although the fictionalized account that i presented was between a heterosexual therapist and client , these boundary violations also occur among gay and lesbian therapists and clients in most cases , sexual exploitation in psychotherapy does n't occur immediately it usually follows after minor boundary violations turn into larger violations , culminating in the most egregious violation of sexual exploitation also , in many cases where there is sexual exploitation in therapy , the psychotherapist , and not the client , is the aggressor so , it goes both ways i intentionally presented a fictionalized account where the client is seductive and has a history of seducing authority figures due to childhood incest because this is a common scenario also , i wanted to demonstrate that even if cases where clients are extremely seductive , the therapist is the one who is still accountable for maintainng profesional boundaries if you are a psychotherapist who has crossed professional boundaries with your client , it is very important that you seek clinical supervision , no matter how long youve been practicing or how experienced you are in most cases , therapists who have violated clients' boundaries should also seek their own personal therapy to work through these issues and do some soul searching as to whether they are in the right profession if you are a client who has been sexually exploited in therapy , do n't suffer in shame alone although it might be hard for you to trust another therapist again , first , seek out a psychotherapy recommendation from your doctor or a trusted friend to work through this abuse second , if you should decide to take legal action against this therapist for what he or she did to you and because you suspect that the therapist might be perpetrating this inappropriate behavior with other clients , seek out the advice of the ethnics board for the professional organization with whom the therapist is affiliated so , it would be the american psychiatric association for psychiatrists , the american psychological assocation for psychologists , and the national association of social workers for clinical social workers you can also seek out the advice of the ethnics department for the state licensing board , who provides licensure for that particular profession you can find this information
