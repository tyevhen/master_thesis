it is nearing the end of the weekend , and the good news is things have gone well i am with my boyfriend , d , at his house we 've been together for the past two days we 've been busy , and i think that has helped keep my mood in check we were especially busy yesterday i had trouble sleeping overnight , so i was out of bed very early d awoke several hours later and we took puck out for some exercise did i mention the doctor is now letting me walk run a little bit ? well , that 's what we did for a couple of miles it was n't much , but it was certainly better than nothing it was cold , but the sun was very bright it was nice to be outside together in the crisp , sunny air after our brief encounter with exercise , we went to see the movie , j edgar it was excellent surprisingly , i was able to stay focused throughout i 'd been having a lot of trouble concentrating and staying focused since my mood tanked again , it was nice to spend the time together with d our big event of the weekend happened last evening i believe i mentioned in my last post that d invited me to his company holiday party ? it was a semi formal affair in a local museum , which we had all to ourselves despite my anxiety , it was a very nice event with about people in attendance i felt honored to be introduced to d 's colleagues , and he thought i looked pretty in my semi formal attire perhaps i 'll post a picture soon after the company party , we actually went out to a bar d 's son was having a party in a local establishment , so we dropped in to say hello there was live music and lots of revelry it was fun and i finally got to meet one of d 's best friends he said d speaks highly of me i felt good about that today brought a little more exercise , brunch at a trendy little restaurant , relaxation and football we are both football fans so we spent time watching our teams his won mine did n't it 's been a little slower day , which has been nice , too i 've been able to take time for myself , as needed , over the weekend d 's been respectful of my need to nap , for example in fact , i just woke up ! i 've struggled with a little anxiety here and there , but the overwhelming , unremitting sadness has , for now , given me a reprieve i hope , as i make my way home and back into my routine , the reprieve will last i think i 'll say a little prayer for that
