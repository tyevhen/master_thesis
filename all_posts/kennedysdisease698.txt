reading the newyork times article , becoming disabled , stirred some emotions i felt the writer , rosemarie garland thomson , did a fine job of crossing the boundaries of what it means to be disabled as well as what is a disability so many of us living with a disability , like a progressive motor neuron disease , have had to face the realization , often far too soon in life , that we are now different initially , we find it to be a lonely world out there fortunately , with the right support , we emerge from the tunnel and discover there is life after disability below is an excerpt from the times article i hope you enjoy it becomingdisabled roughly one in five americans lives with a disability so where is our pride movement ? the fact is , most of us will move in and out of disability in our lifetimes , whether we do so through illness , an injury or merely the process of aging the world health organization defines disability as an umbrella term that encompasses impairments , activity limitations and participation restrictions that reflect the complex interaction between features of a person s body and features of the society in which he or she lives the americans with disabilities act tells us that disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities obviously , this category is broad and constantly shifting , so exact statistics are hard to come by , but the data from our most reliable sources is surprising the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that one in five adults in the united states is living with a disability the national organization on disability says there are million disabled people indeed , people with disabilities are the largest minority group in the united states , and as new disability categories such as neurodiversity , psychiatric disabilities , disabilities of aging and learning disabilities emerge and grow , so does that percentage still , most americans don t know how to be disabled few of us can imagine living with a disability or using the technologies that disabled people often need since most of us are not born into disability but enter into it as we travel through life , we don t get acculturated the way most of us do in our race or gender yet disability , like any challenge or limitation , is fundamental to being human a part of every life clearly , the border between us and them is fragile we just might be better off preparing for disability than fleeing from it becoming disabled demands learning how to live effectively as a person with disabilities , not just living as a disabled person trying to become nondisabled it also demands the awareness and cooperation of others who don t experience these challenges becoming disabled means moving from isolation to community , from ignorance to knowledge about who we are , from exclusion to access , and from shame to pride photo http www telegraph co uk travel travelviews
