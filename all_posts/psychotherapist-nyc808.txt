in recent years , increasingly , many psychotherapists have come to realize that mind body oriented psychotherapy offers opportunities for healing that regular talk therapy alone often does not offer there are different types of mind body oriented psychotherapy , including clinical hypnosis , emdr eye movement desensitization and reprocessing , somatic experiencing , psychomotor psychotherapy , focusing , all of which i have used in my psychotherapy private practice in nyc many experiences of talk therapy , but no change many clients come to see me feeling discouraged often , they have made many attempts on their own and attempts in regular talk therapy to make changes in their lives , but these attempts have not resulted in change mind body oriented psychotherapy often , clients in regular talk therapy develop intellectual insight into their problems , but there is no emotional insight they can explain why they have the problems that they have , but no healing has taken place why is this ? usually , it 's because regular talk therapy alone often does n't penetrate beyond our conscious minds it involves our intellect which , of course , is important for any type of change that we might be contemplating but for many problems , this is n't enough the treatment needs to go beyond the surface to a more visceral level why is mind body oriented psychotherapy more effective than regular talk therapy ? mind body oriented psychotherapy will often access deeper levels of consciousness because we can feel the treatment occurring on a visceral level it 's not just a matter of talking about the problem on an intellectual level mind body oriented psychotherapy helps clients to change from the inside out clients are taught how to recognize where they feel their emotions in their body , and this helps them to access deeper levels of consciousness as well as enabling them to change at a deeper level i'm certainly not saying that regular talk therapy does n't ever work my early training is as a psychoanalyst and i still practice psychodynamic psychotherapy however , for many problems , this type of therapy is not enough , which is why so many psychoanalysts and psychodynamic psychotherapists have learned various types of mind body oriented psychotherapy in my next blog post , i will discuss a particular type of mind body oriented psychotherapy called somatic experiencing , which was developed by peter levine , ph d http www traumahealing com i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr therapist , and somatic experiencing therapist to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at
