in my last post , i discussed how to make the social security disability process work for you in today 's post , i want to provide a few more tips to help speed up the qualification process preparation is the key as mentioned yesterday , 'preparation' is half the battle below are several comments on how to help ease the reviewer and others through your disability application process the easier it is for them , the easier it will be for you discuss your intentions with your manager or supervisor and the need for their support you do not want anyone to be surprised advise your doctors and his her staff that you are applying for social security disability benefits ask the doctors for his her support review preferably in written form your current symptoms and any health related issues that affect your ability to perform your current duties in the initial submission , provide the reviewer with as much information as possible the more the better in this case the more information the reviewer has to work with initially , the less information he she has to write off for meaning a delay in the process the more information requested by the reviewer , the greater the chance the doctor 's office will not be able to find it and or it will be delayed if you control the information flow , you can make certain the most important information is in the front and that the important sections information are highlighted so the reviewer can easily find the critical information he she needs to make a decision make certain the information submitted is readable and prioritized in the order you want it presented be sure to sign and date all the forms use the 'supplemental section' to educate the reviewer on what kennedy 's disease sbma is , its symptoms , its treatment , etc provide the information in a 'report' format tabbed , with page numbers and a table of contents , etc so the reviewer can easily locate the information he she is looking for prepare a three ring binder with the major sections tabbed this will keep all of your information in one place and easy to find the information should be in the same order and page numbers as submitted with the disability application keep a copy of everything submitted just in case if called , refer to the information by section and page number so the reviewer can easily find the information he she is looking for take the binder with you to any reviews or hearings be patient and responsive to follow up inquiries by the reviewer if needed , follow up with your doctors and supervisor to insure they have provided the requested information how long does the process take ? it generally takes longer to process claims for disability benefits than other types of social security claims plan on to days you can help shorten the process by bringing certain documents with you when you apply and helping the ssa to get any other medical evidence you need to show you are disabled these include your social security number and proof of age names , addresses and phone numbers of doctors , hospitals , clinics and institutions that treated you and dates of treatment names of all medications you are taking medical records from your doctors , therapists , hospitals , clinics and caseworkers laboratory and test results a summary of where you worked and the kind of work you did a copy of your w form wage and tax statement , or , if you are self employed , your federal tax return for the past year dates of prior marriages and births of your children do not become frustrated it is not uncommon to initially be denied if that happens , schedule a meeting with your local social security representative to review your application and ask for their opinion why the application was denied try to remove your emotions from this discussion it is easy to become frustrated and start blaming the system or others , but try not to do it work with your representative to resolve any known issues with the application or concerns with your claim the representative can be a great advocate then , file an appeal i hope this brief post helps to explain the process and some key 'learnings' based upon my experience to learn more about the application process , contact your local social security administration office , by going online to http www ssa gov disability or , by calling the pdf guide i wrote can be found here http www kennedysdisease org images stories pdfs social security disability pdf
