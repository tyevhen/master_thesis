today 's post is by clinkshrink and is over at our clinical psychiatry news site she discusses the case of a belgium prisoner who wants to be euthanized for his intractable psychiatric illness , and she wonders if that might antisocial personality disorder while i'm sending you places , let me also suggest psychpractice where there 's a discussion about an app called pager in new york that lets you get instant home visits within two hours from a doctor being one to push the envelope , psychpractice asked about gynecology and psychiatry home visits personally , i think it 's a great idea quick , in home consult to get someone started in care rather then waiting weeks for an outpatient appointment with a psychiatrist , or sitting for hours in an er could we prevent hospitalizations this way ? or would there just be more when very sick or very dangerous people who might otherwise let it pass , instead called for a consult ?
