as i 've mentioned in prior blog articles , including mind body psychotherapy what your body is telling you , integrating the mind body connection in therapy offers many advantages over regular talk therapy , one of them being that emotional states in the body offer a window into the unconscious mind mind body psychotherapy the body offers a window into the unconscious mind what is mind body psychotherapy ? mind body psychotherapy is a general name for different types of psychotherapy that integrate the mind body connection , including clinical hypnosis also known as hypnotherapy , emdr , and somatic experiencing , to name just a few how does mind body psychotherapy offer a window into the unconscious mind ? many people know that dreams offer a window into the unconscious i enjoy working with clients' dreams in my psychotherapy private practice in nyc the problem is that not everyone remembers their dreams but everyone has access to his or her body , and a therapist who works with the mind body connection can help psychotherapy clients access what 's happening in the body in terms of embodied emotional states let 's take a look at an example of this with a composite case , which represents many different psychotherapy cases rita rita had been to several different therapists over the course of her s and s prior to coming to see me although she felt she benefited from talk therapy , she also felt there was something missing that she was unable to get to in her prior experiences with therapy rita came to me because she knew that , in addition to doing talk therapy and emdr , i use somatic experiencing and clinical hypnosis with my psychotherapy clients at first , rita had a hard time putting her feelings into words but when we focused on what she was experiencing in her body , she was able to sense into her physical sensations and gradually identify the emotions that went with those physical sensations so , for example , when i asked rita to sense into her body , she said she sensed a heaviness in her upper abdominal area i asked rita to stay with that , as long as it felt tolerable to her then , after a few minutes , she said that she sensed , within the heaviness in her upper abdomen , a hollowness we stayed with that hollowness and , gradually , emotions emerged i saw tears begin to stream down rita 's face , and she was able to say she felt very sad i asked rita to stay with the sadness and , after a few minutes , she had a memory of being alone as a young child crying for her mother mind body psychotherapy rita had a memory of being alone as a young child over the next several sessions , as we continued to work with the physical sensations that rita sensed in her body and the accompanying emotions , more memories emerged as we continued to work together , what emerged was early childhood memories of feeling sad in a household where rita was raised by a single mother who worked three jobs to support them as a result , rita was often alone and lonely as an adult , even when rita was in a healthy , loving romantic relationship , she often felt this heavy feeling in the upper abdomen , a hollow feeling of sadness and loneliness even though she was n't alone any more , she continued to feel the unresolved emotions from her childhood part of the work was helping rita to separate then her childhood experiences from now her adult life using a combination of somatic experiencing and clinical hypnosis another part of the work was helping rita heal from her earlier emotional wounds we did this by working with the child part of her that felt a deep longing to be loved and nurtured in a relaxed state , rita , as her adult self , had an inner dialogue with her child self , expressing love and compassion for this child self then , she sensed into that child part and she was able to take in the love and compassion that her adult self was giving i also helped rita to imagine a nurturing parental figure who could have been there for her when she was younger she chose an uncle , who actually lived out of state when she was a child , but when he was around , he was loving and emotionally supportive with guidance in therapy , rita sensed back into her childhood experience as a lonely child feeling her unmet emotional needs and longing then , she imagined that her uncle was sitting next to her with his arm around her she sensed the physical sensation of his loving gesture and how that felt in her body both physically and emotionally then , i helped rita to hold onto this experience with a technique called anchoring in clinical hypnosis , so she could access the felt sense of this nurturing experience whenever she needed it access to the unconscious experience with somatic experiencing as i mentioned earlier , there are various types of mind body psychotherapy that help people to access unconscious experience by sensing into what they feel in their bodies different people sense into their bodies in different ways many people start with what 's happening to them physically others have an intuitive sense others close their eyes get visual images it does n't matter how someone begins the process of accessing their emotional and physical states in their bodies to get to their unconscious mind the important thing is that the body provides a way to access the unconscious mind and it 's a matter of learning how to tune in learning to tune into the body to sense physical and emotional states many people need to learn how to tune into the body to sense physical and emotional states because it does n't come naturally to them for clients who have difficulty , i help them with a step by step process that most people can learn i usually recommend that people read ann weiser cornell 's book , the power of focusing a practical guide to emotional self healing , a book that helps people to develop a felt sense of their experiences in an easy , accessible way getting help
