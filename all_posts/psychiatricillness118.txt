i visited my gp yesterday and the psychiatrist this morning i said i have been feeling a bit low for a few weeks now the gp is being really helpful , i am having a load of blood tests next week to rule out anything physical the psychiatrist is suggesting that my quetiapine is reduced from mg to mg daily he says i am probably sleeping too much because i am over sedated he also said it might be a bit of depression therefore , if i am not more lively in weeks i have to increase the sertraline back up to mg daily i have to go back to the psychiatrist in weeks i am a little worried about going privately to the psychiatrist and having nhs prescriptions what if the meds he recommends are not available on the nhs there has been a lot in the media about this recently also when i bought my flat i moved out of the catchment area for my current gp and have not changed gp yet i do n't want to change as i now have a young female doctor who seems on the ball she is the first decent gp i have had in about years
