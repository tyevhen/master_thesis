after not writing anything on this blog for over ten days , i figured i should let readers know i 'll have no internet access for a week instead of at home , i 'll be in an apartment in town with a group of friends , hanging out for what will hopefully be a very pleasant week i'm afraid i do n't have much to say right now , and even if i did , i do n't have time to say it , since i have n't finished packing yet ! sure , i could make a trip or two home during the week , but i 'd rather spend my time with friends , not driving bussing into the suburbs to pick up stuff from home now , is there anything else i should add ? hmm , well , as of yesterday , i'm not longer a teenager i have left those years behind me forever seems a bit weird still , actually , though it does n't feel nearly as horrifyingly momentous as i feared it would ! it was n't a bad day at all , when i turned this is my birthday in pictures me and mom emi looking pensively out the window , on our cake good bread groceries for my gathering shopping trip emi thinks wine umbrellas go well together and , of course , there was cake with candles lit candles ! do n't you love the four scattered lighters needed for a few candles ? which , being the birthday gal , i proceeded to blow out cake ! gifts included the first two seasons of supernatural yay ! , and the newest cd from rise against plus some money put towards the aforementioned week long gathering , for which i leave tomorrow ! organizing it has proved to be rather stressful , but i'm really hoping it 'll be an enjoyable vacation hanging out with friends and just chilling getting away from a house that 's in the middle of some major repairs thanks to some serious leakage it should be good and that is all ! i wish everyone a lovely week , and i hope to come back online in a week filled with fresh inspiration , and ready to finally overcome the huge writing block i 've had for the last month ! i can hope , right ?
