today 's example comes from dan brown 's the da vinci code , a book not to be put down lightly , but as dorothy parker would say to be hurled with some force to a far corner of the room in chapter of the da vinci code , we encounter captain bezu fache carried himself like an angry ox , with his wide shoulders thrown back and his chin tucked hard into his chest his dark hair was slicked back with oil , accentuating an arrow like widow 's peak that divided his jutting brow and preceded him like the prow of a battleship as he advanced , his dark eyes seemed to scorch the earth before him , radiating a fiery clarity that forecast his reputation for unblinking severity in all matters do angry oxen throw their shoulders back and tuck their chins hard into their chests ? maybe i 'll have to pay more attention , next time i'm around an ox we know what a widow 's peak looks like is there really any need to say arrow like ? if the widow 's peak preceded him like the prow of a battleship , it must have been several yards long and quite heavy how do eyes seem to scorch something ? what precisely is a fiery clarity ? how does a clarity fiery or otherwise get radiated ? how does a fiery clarity forecast things ? does n't forecast mean predict ? how does a clarity make predictions ? does severity blink ? does it unblink ? grade d minus we get that bezu fache is ox like , has a widow 's peak , and has dark eyes fair enough but please , do n't tell us about eyes that seem to scorch things while radiating clarities that predict reputations for severity
