a conversation with govert viergever this took place at the moment he and i got together to create closure on the project with him and neuroptimal we have sat together for two hours , enjoying a good bulletproof coffee , in amsterdam on nov th hannie i am definitely a big fan neuroptimal has proofed itself as a fantastic brain training brain hacking system the most important shifts i noticed happened within the first two months that i have been using the system i noticed increased focus and concentration not only during our races and training , but also in my everyday life i noticed my mind was calmer , as if there was less noise going on in my mind due to that , my inner creativity emerged , and , i re gained access to ideas i used to have , as i thought they had disappeared over the years to give you an example i have always found lots of joy in creating small video blogs on food and wellbeing those videos , some of them are over years old , were funny and interesting for my fans i still receive feedback on them , although i haven t been creating new ones recently due to lack of inspiration at this point , it has been over weeks ago since my last session , my mind is still quiet , and i have been able to work out new ideas on how i would like to use my knowledge and experience in the future i will not be rowing at this level anymore within to years tokyo , the olympics , is my next goal i have always dreamt of winning a gold medal at the games after that , i would like to have a plan ready my website is almost finished , i am ready to start my own business and see if i can inspire young people to live their dream and teach them how to take good care of their health and wellbeing even now , even given the fact that my last good neuroptimal session took place over a month ago , i still enjoy the results and effects of my sessions for that , i am grateful that i have been given the chance to work with neuroptimal and hannie ruinen and , i am definitely in for more neuroptimal for athletes at this moment , our coaches decided to take apart the teams we were during this season we are now all individual rowers in january new teams will be formed , and i will have three new boat mates that i have to get to know and , we have to see if we can tie our energy together hannie explained to me , that it is possible to interconnect the hookups with more than just one person the star hookup makes sense to me as it comes to connecting energy both hannie and i will explore the idea of doing a rowers team intensive training during days next season i am really curious about the results and the experience of that , as well what it will be doing with me and my new team our journey will continue thank you govert viergever
