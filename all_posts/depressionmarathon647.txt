minnesota public radio announced this morning that our humidity level yesterday was as high or higher than the humidity level in the amazon rain forest that will continue into today , and tomorrow , and the next day combine the humidity with our air temperatures , in the mid 's , and they say it will feel like it 's degrees today ! and guess what ? my air conditioner is n't working it has n't worked properly all weekend ahhh the joy of owning a home i'm stressed there is never a good time for things to break , but now ? c'mon ! it 's hot my dog is panting just lying on the floor heck , i'm panting when i went outside this morning , my glasses fogged up from all the water hanging in the air ! plus , i'm coming off three months without work , secondary to this damn illness , so my financial situation is a bit precarious like i said , there 's never a good time for things to break i did what i could over the weekend i discovered i could keep my indoor air temp around degrees with the judicious use of shades , fans , closed doors , etc i felt like i was living in a cave , but it was better than the alternative ! i called two different ac guys , both of whom called back this morning i'm currently waiting for one of them to arrive hopefully , the fix will not be too painful over the weekend , i also discovered when i'm stressed , my mood takes a hit my mood took a hit this weekend it was n't a big hit , perhaps because i was aware of where the hit came from i did what i could to deal with it i did n't worry i did n't give the dip more power than it deserved i recognized it i acknowledged it , and i tried to let it go it seems to have worked this morning , i'm less stressed and my mood has improved but that was a good lesson to learn stress potential lower mood good to know now i wait the ac will soon be fixed i do appreciate owning my own home i know i am fortunate it is n't always a stress free proposition , but i'm glad to be here
