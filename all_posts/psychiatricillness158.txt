it s not true names do hurt and produce emotional scars that stay within the soul for life a woman could not escape the bondage of a name her father gave her when she was a child the devil s daughter she was freed from it eventually , but not without hours of counseling and struggle unkind words are like deadly missiles that penetrate all the soul s defenses and blast a hole in the personality that may take years to repair on the other hand , words that are encouraging can lift and cheer the soul in a way that is quite amazing c e macartney tells how he saw sitting on a bench a minister whom he had known the man was well advanced in years and broken in health as a result of his condition , he had given up his church and was unable to participate in any kind of pulpit ministry macartney says , i turned to speak to him , expecting to hear from him some word of melancholy , reminiscence or present gloom , but i received a pleasant surprise he told me that a woman going by had just spoken to him and told him that a message he had given many years ago had been the means of bringing her to christ the glow on his face was something i shall never forget how wonderful it will be if today you and i can say a cheerful and encouraging word to someone that will lift their burden , lighten their darkness and minister the life of god into their soul at least let s try ! by ayo ashanti
