there 's a war in progress , and the outcome of it will affect the future of computing it 's important to see it for what it is , so you can prepare for the consequences the consequences unless there 's a cease fire in the meantime will be enormous to get a handle on it requires a certain appreciation for the importance of operating systems let 's back up the truck for a minute and talk about operating systems , and windows in particular two different things , really non technical computer users can be forgiven , i think , for misusing the term operating system in the context of windows underneath windows is an operating system , to be sure , but the collection of applications that , in the aggregate , gives windows its windowsness has little to do with operating systems an operating system is really about the core essential software that discovers and registers devices , controls the bootstrapping of a machine 's services at boot time , and provides various hosting services to applications from a human user 's point of view , that last bit providing hosting services to apps is the most important aspect of an operating system it 's what makes it possible for us to run programs and get work done but consider what has happened over the past decade or so the web has become a central metaphor in computing , not just at the level of desktop pcs but also a variety of handheld and other devices initially , the web was a world of static content you visited a url with a browser , the browser rendered the page , and you hopped from url to url via hypertext links but now the web is full of highly interactive web apps , and the browser is merely an interactive hosting environment for client server apps in which part of the logic executes locally and part executes on a server somewhere the browser is now the logical analog of a desktop os , in many ways mooting the importance of something like , say , windows this has worked to microsoft 's disadvantage , obviously when people rely more and more heavily on a browser to get work done , it tends to marginalize the importance of desktop software and since the web is , at its very core , standards driven tcp ip , http , html , urls , etc all universally understood standards , the concept of a non standardized , proprietary os that does n't understand how to interoperate with non native software or with other oses runs counter to a user 's needs and actually becomes an anti feature when the most important thing a computer os can do is provide connectivity to an outside world that 's based on standards , the proprietary os is a liability in fact , the web makes all oses equally irrelevant , in some sense , which is one reason apple is doing well , because the age old cupertino stigma of having a non windows interoperable os is no longer , in fact , a stigma the field is almost level now to the degree that things like windows have become sidelined in importance compared to the virtual os of the web browser , rich internet aware but also desktop aware runtime frameworks like adobe air become hugely important they represent the next platform and that necessarily also means the next potentially proprietary platform , because adobe to stay with the air example is a closed source company that still makes most of its money from proprietary , non open software even if you want to make the hollow argument that the flash standard is open and uses actionscript open and xml open , etc , you still have to concede that adobe has an iron grip over what flash and flex consist of , and where they 're headed the only question let 's be frank about this is whether adobe is a benevolent dictator or a venal , conniving one the battle for the rich internet application platform high ground is really a proprietary platform play the next big attempt to lock computer users into privately controlled technologies technologies like flash and flex that could be foundational to future computing the winner be it adobe , microsoft , or oracle will find itself with a great concentration of power in its hands which , if we 've learned anything at all from history , is a very bad thing indeed so before you get too worked up about air , silverlight , or javafx , before you drink anybody 's kool aid and start passing the cup around , remember what you 're dealing with these technologies are n't about making the world more standards driven or putting more control in the hands of the user they 're about putting control of the web experience in the hands of a multibillion dollar closed source software giant choose your poison carefully of course , if one of the big ria contenders decides to go open source , and put the future of the platform whichever one it turns out to be completely under community governance , then we have nothing to fear we have a democracy but do n't hold your breath
