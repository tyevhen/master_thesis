the following article was snipped from nih gov s blog it describes another improvement in the gene editing research going on around the world the process is still experimental , but it is moving in the right direction read my next article on huntington 's desease kennedy 's disease could be right around the corner to read the entire article , click on the title below geneediting gold nanoparticle delivery shows promise posted on october , by dr francis collins nih funded researchers have developed a highly versatile approach to crispr cas based therapies instead of relying on viruses to carry the gene editing system into cells , the new approach uses tiny particles of gold as the delivery system ! in order to fix a disease causing mutation like the expanded dna repeat that causes fa friedreich s ataxia , researchers must create a crispr cas system that contains a scissor like cas enzyme and a synthetic guide rna , which steers cas to the specific part of the genome that needs to be snipped out if a very precise correction is to be made , a repair template that contains the desired dna code must also be included the challenge is delivering all these components into the appropriate tissues in a safe and efficient manner currently , most researchers use inactivated , non disease causing viruses to ferry various parts of the crispr cas system into cells however , because of size constraints , it s not possible to fit all three components into a single virus also , because of the large number of viral particles needed to carry crispr cas components in separately , there are concerns that viral delivery systems could trigger immune responses in people not only could such immune responses pose a safety hazard to patients , they could also reduce the effectiveness of the viral delivery system because of these challenges , there s been great interest in developing better ways to deliver crispr cas therapeutics in the new study recently reported in nature biomedical engineering , irina conboy and niren murthy at the university of california , berkeley , decided to try a delivery vehicle they call crispr gold gold might seem like an odd choice , but gold nanoparticles possess a special ability to penetrate cell membranes and have been considered for use in delivering therapies for cancer , rheumatoid arthritis , and many other conditions in addition , gold is generally well tolerated by the human body and has the advantage of linking easily to dna the crispr gold system which consists of a dna linked gold nanoparticle containing cas , guide rna , and a dna repair template is designed to enter cells through endocytosis , a process in which the cell engulfs outside molecules a special polymer that encases the crispr gold system helps to ensure the gene editing tools reach the cell s genome in an active state in a series of tests , the researchers showed that crispr gold could enter a variety of cell types in laboratory culture , including immune cells , muscle cell progenitors , human induced pluripotent stem cells , and human embryonic stem cells once inside the cells , crispr gold could successfully find and edit a target gene in a non toxic manner similar success occurred when crispr gold was injected into the muscles of living lab mice the next big challenge was to test crispr gold s potential in a model of human disease so , researchers turned to a mouse model of duchenne muscular dystrophy dmd , a fatal disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakening and caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for the protein dystrophin they injected crispr gold containing a template for a healthy dystrophin gene into the leg muscles of young dmd mice at the same time , they injected a toxin intended to encourage muscle cells to multiply because , for crispr editing to work optimally , cells must be actively dividing the outcome was encouraging after one injection of crispr gold , about percent of the dystrophin genes in the muscle tissue of the dmd mice had been corrected what s more , the animal s muscles produced functional dystrophin protein , and they performed better on tests of muscle strength there was also good news on the safety front the dmd mice didn t appear to have a strong immune reaction to the treatment the researchers also didn t find evidence that crispr gold caused much , if any , unintended off target damage to the animals dna taken together , the findings suggest that , pending further replication , optimization , and careful testing , crispr gold might have promise for treating humans with dmd what makes this approach especially exciting is that it also holds potential for treating or even curing many other genetic diseases
