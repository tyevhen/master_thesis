rob dobrenski , phd is a psychologist who blogs over on shrinktalk net he 's written a book about what it 's like to be a psychology graduate student , a psychotherapy patient , and a psychologist oh , we like the folks who go from shrink blog to shrink book it somehow feels familiar and so i agreed to read his book crazy tales on and off the couch so bear with me while i tell you that the book rubbed me wrong at the outset dr dobrenski begins by saying something to the effect that he describes things that all shrinks feel , and if they say they do n't , they are n't being honest i really hate it when people tell me what i feel it 's like saying that prozac made your depression better and if it did n't , then you just did n't recognize it and then the book gets off on a provocative start rob discovers that many people in his life , from a patient , to a colleague , to himself are f ing crazy the asterisks are mine dr dobrenski had no trouble using the word i counted times in the pages , including in direct quotes of discussions he has with both a patient and one of his supervisors not in a million years i was n't sure what the point was to let people know he knows obscene words ? to be provocative , obviously somewhere around page , the author begins to talk about his work with a teenage boy he loses some of his bravado , chills on the cool , dirty words , and when he talks about this socially awkward teen who keeps him jumping with his incessant questions , i turned a corner it suddenly felt genuine , and i could feel rob 's anxiety as he was in the room with this boy who would have made any therapist uncomfortable oh , plus rob 's back goes in to spasm and he has to deal with this as he finesses conducting the session somehow rob has either willingly taken on , or been thrust into , the role of being the patient 's sex educator a little unusual , but i do think many therapists can identify with being cornered into an uncomfortable role in therapy if not for many sessions , then at least for a few minutes but seeing a year old in a blue blazer with a crest on it , speaking like dr ruth , made me feel beads of perspiration form on my forehead why are some people gay and some straight ? i sensed that jack 's questions might be getting progressively more difficult that 's actually a question that no one truly knows the answer to and you , robert ? what do you think ? did i murder someone ? am i on trial here ? again , the rule do not lie i ended up enjoying the rest of the book and i thought he did a nice job describing his work with sex offenders and their partners worth the read for someone who wants a peek into therapy without actually going , but probably not for the practicing shrink just a few minor details there 's no medication called xypreza , it 's zyprexa , and zoloft does not come in mg doses and finally , the peek is a peek , it 's not an in depth examination , and it is from a single perspective and finally , to the guy who starts his book by saying , any shrink who tells you he ca n't relate to what is written here is incredibly private and guarded i 'd like to assert that eating photographs of your ex girlfriend is really weird and is not a universal phenomena there are some things you may be better off not announcing to the world
