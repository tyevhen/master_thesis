the time machine , by h g wells narrated by greg wagland this review contains spoilers using a time machine of his own making , a man travels to the year , to discover a world where humans have diverged into two separate species the first species he meets are the eloi they are an indulgent people living in what the time traveler calls a communist society it appears to be a utopian society in which everyone shares living spaces and food but our time traveler soon discovers that this society is n't as perfect as it seems the eloi are an uncaring race when one of their own is drowning , they glance uncaringly in her direction and then move on with their own entertainments as if such an event were normal and uninteresting there is a complete decline of intellect soon enough , our time traveler meets a second brutish and cunning race that live underground they are called the morlocks how he discovers this is unclear , since the morlocks do n't talk to him and the eloi refuse to talk about them as if it is extremely rude even to bring them up he has very little contact with them , but he believes that the morlocks eat the eloi at a loss for what exactly h g wells was getting at when he wrote this book , i read a couple of critical essays critics say that h g wells was suggesting that there would be an inevitable decline in intellect of the human race , was parodying the indulgent and uncaring aristocracy and the brutishness of the working class a common parody of his time , and was parodying communism despite the fact that he , himself , was a socialist my father suggested that h g wells had the nazis morlocks and the jews eloi in mind when he wrote the time traveler though i find it hard to believe that the wells believed that the jews were a self indulgent and unintellectual race what i noticed about both the time machine and the war of the worlds is that both mentioned a subclass of humans who , in the future , would prey upon other humans in war of the worlds it was suggested that humans might , in the future , be used as slaves to hunt humans so the alien race could eat them thus i am inclined to believe that h g wells is suggesting that some humans have a brutish quality in which they inevitably take advantage of and prey upon an untintellectual and uncaring group of people i am also interested in this communist aspect what was he saying ? if you have any ideas , please let me know i am curious what other people think of this story
