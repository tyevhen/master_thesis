i'm happy to report i am still improving and feeling better in fact , we are currently in the process of deciding if i should go home from the hospital tomorrow i really want to go , and i think i can handle it my mom is in town until sunday , so it would be nice to go home and spend a couple of days with her not to mention the fact that it would be nice to go home to a house that is not empty i feel like i am ready i feel ready , but of course i am nervous and a little unsure i mean this is my fourth hospital admission in the past or weeks i do n't want to come back in again , and i certainly do n't want my mood to decline at all ! i'm actually a little more anxious about leaving this evening than i was just a few hours ago when it was almost a certainty i was going i just learned two of my regular outpatient treatment team members , including my psychiatrist , are concerned about me leaving they are especially concerned that i will be going on a friday because there are few , if any , supportive services over the weekend so they are concerned i do n't exactly know why that increases my level of anxiety , but it does i'm now near tears wondering what i should do i want to go home so badly , but i do n't want something to happen and end up disappointing anyone i value and respect the opinions of my treatment team members i 'd hate to disappoint them yet i want to go home , and i think i 'll be okay , but there is always a possibility i wo n't i do have my weekend days generally planned in order to decrease the risk of getting overwhelmed , scared , or anxious but this is an illness , after all i only have so much control i'm happy to report i am still improving and feeling better i'm discouraged to report i may not return home tomorrow , despite really , really wanting to go at this moment , i'm not sure what i will do stay tuned
