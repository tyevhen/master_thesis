i 've been trying really hard to write this post for months now i had written content prior to launching the blog in october my writing process varies from drawing upon memories and experiences of my own , reacting to mental health coverage online and in the news and sometimes finding unexpected triggers of inspiration in objects , tv programmes and quotes most often something will come into my head when i'm suffering from insomnia , i know i have to get it down immediately in case i suddenly drift into sleep and wake up not being able to recall those thoughts in the morning sometimes an entire post will come to me immediately , i 'll write it in the notes app on my phone and barely edit the wording when it comes to typing it up on my laptop there are occasions , like this one , where i 've been desperate to discuss an important topic , most likely a sensitive one too , and i 'll just be stumped by it the sentences form very slowly and i 'll trip over the wording , really beating myself up over the quality of it all i 've attempted to write this post four , perhaps five times some of my notes were lighthearted in attempts to skim over the darkness of the content , whereas other notes go into a dangerous amount of detail which could trigger a period of depression or self harm for those with mental health conditions i started writing this post thinking i 'd finally worked up the courage to discuss my experience with and knowledge of self harm i'm afraid i have n't quite managed that today , some areas are easier for me to write about but self harm is an incredibly serious , sensitive and tricky subject to manoeuvre around and i do n't want to cause any harm to anyone by not wording it correctly its also still an incredibly raw nerve for me i often say the last time i harmed myself was this time last year but to be honest i somehow manage to block out that it happened not so long ago , so please give me time to do the subject justice my main motivation behind this blog is believing that i could help just one person with my words , so someone knows that they are n't alone in what they 're going through i know how that feels , i did n't have any idea what was happening to me when i was , i just happened to stumble across the lovely zoella who had just posted about panic attacks that 's all it took , it clicked in my head i am not alone in this , and neither are you as i tried to write this post i felt myself slipping into a dark spot , feeling sore around my eyes , waiting for the tears to form and thinking that closing the laptop lid and retreating was inevitable it seems ridiculous to me that i can become so tongue tied even when it comes to a subject which i'm very familiar with , painfully familiar with this is my duty , my job as such to help people with my words and hopefully educate those who do n't quite understand aspects of mental illness so when i feel like i'm failing at that i plunge into the dark pits of depression and submerge myself in it feeling desperate to scream at myself , but the pit wo n't let the sound bounce back to me , i ca n't hear the scream , or perhaps i just ca n't let it out for everyone else to hear it can be incredibly hard to write it down accurately , or to the level i expect from myself i do n't want to skimp on the details or publish anything until its just right sometimes i wish i could video myself talking about all this , but i'm usually just as inarticulate when i speak out loud , although perhaps those reading would actually feel like there is a real girl behind all of this i use blogging as a way of expressing myself when words fail me when interacting with others in person , i head a youtuber say something that rung true and applicable to me the other day i mean , i'm on youtube because i do n't know how to interact in the real world thomas tomska , i often forget how hard this process can be , i'm pouring out my soul , my past , my present to hundreds of readers each week , i am thrilled that my blog generates on average , views each month , thank you to everyone who reads my ramblings i do n't want to give up on writing the blog , i do n't even wish to take a break , but i do want people to realise how difficult it can be i may be 'cheerful chelsea' but the truth is more often than not , i can be far from that persona this was evident when i was trying to arrange this post in my mind for the thousandth time i'm a hardcore fan geek when it comes to video extras of films and tv programmes , and i was watching a behind the making of game of thrones prior to writing this , and i just zoned out around twenty minutes of videos passed me by and i was n't jumping for joy with my nose pressed against the screen to take in every detail not like me at all , i usually re watch these segments at least five times so when that happened due to stressing over a blog post i did question whether this all does more harm than good i really hope it helps someone so perhaps i did n't quite make it to writing the self harm post i had intended , perhaps i 've just discovered that fretting about things too much can be a form of self harm in itself just know that the intended post is coming also , on a final note , try to keep this in mind everything will be fine in the end if it is not fine , then it is not yet the end quote from
