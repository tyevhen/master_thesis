a few weeks ago i wrote about my difficulty making a decision about a job offer the company i'm working for as an on call employee wants to make me a full time hours per week employee the hourly salary is less , but i 'd get all the benefits i currently lack like health insurance , retirement savings , and paid time off and i 'd have a stable , regular income if i do n't take the position offered , someone else will be hired , and i 'll have to hustle for hours at a different facility getting enough hours usually is n't too difficult , but it 's not guaranteed if patient census falls and facilities slow down , they may not have any need for extra help from me that 's the risk i take for the benefit of being able to control my own schedule my fear with having a set schedule , which will be four hour days , is i wo n't be able to handle it physically and mentally i'm doing well now working about hours per week , but i never work more than days per week i generally work hour shifts monday , wednesday , and friday i use tuesday and thursday for appointments , exercise , and rest since my depression began i 've needed that time i have n't worked full time in years in the past i 've struggled when working more than hours per week , or when i 've worked more than a couple days in a row for those reasons , i told my employer last week i could n't take the position it was a decision based on worry and fear within hours i had changed my mind well , i did n't totally change my mind , and i did n't totally lose my worry and fear but i made a decision to try i negotiated with my boss to allow me to continue as an on call employee while i take a stab at working hours per week she agreed beginning right after christmas , i will be working four hour shifts per week , monday , tuesday , wednesday and friday i 'll try the schedule for at least two weeks , and if it goes well i will take the position if i find it 's too much , mentally or physically , i 'll remain an on call employee , and my employer will continue looking for a permanent physical therapist it 's a perfect solution i get to trial the very job i 've been offered without committing to the offer i'm still apprehensive i'm still afraid it 's going to be too much i'm still worried about being tied to a regular schedule but i'm going to try it and i really do hope i handle it well it would be nice to have the income stability and benefits i 've lacked for several years i'm also very pleased my employer knows about my depression they know i was recently hospitalized , and they know i missed a ton of work because of it and they still want me to work for them for someone who has been fired in the past , because i was missing too much work while being treated for depression , that 's very refreshing it will be easy to give them my best i 'll let you know how it goes
