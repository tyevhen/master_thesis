as i 've mentioned in earlier posts its crucial to notice the small changes and to put them in the spot lights , and lately there were many including when i walked the street some guys came up to me and wanted to take a photo of me for some project their doing for school , so i agreed , than in a store i had a problem paying with credit card so i had to talk to the bank on the phone , took a lot of time and patience and apparently i kept my coolness or so it seemed to the three girls that were there , complimented me about that , and later on i felt one of them was kinda hot and maybe i should hit on her or at least try to start a conversation i will do that tommorow i wonder what will happen also went out to this show , with some friends , was ok , but in the enterance i kinda flirted a bit with the girl that sold the tickets it was fun and short show was ok too , than we went to drink something and met another girlfriend of one of the girls , she was very shy i think i managed the situation well , drank two beers was ok email this blogthis ! share to twitter share to facebook reactions
