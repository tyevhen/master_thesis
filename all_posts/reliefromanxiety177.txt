on the way back from my cycle through germany you can sponsor me here we visited belgium it was my first time in belgium and i have to say it 's intriguing to say the least i did see some weird and wacky things i only spent two days in belgium , but during that time we visited ghent and brussels brussels was the place i really wanted to see , but it was very touristic full of souvenir shops however there were some great chocolate stores and a lovely cheese store called 'tonton garby 's cheese store' where he made home made sandwiches and who is the friendliest person i have ever met if you ever go to brussels , make sure to say i recommended you the food was great too ! i much preferred ghent , which had kept more of it 's culture on the night we arrived , it was the last day of the ghent music festival to which , had been to the night before the atmosphere was electric and there were so many diverse characters i also managed to find the best vintage shop ever there was so much variety , at such a good price i ended up buying four items , which i will do a post about later on the pubs and bars are a world away from anything like the uk so full of character , quirkiness and the best music the trams were also pretty cool and so were the churches in which i lit a candle and watched the most beautiful church choir sing angelic ! in one of the churches there was also a 'thought tree' in which i left a note about my blog if any of you find it , let me know ! on the last night however , my dad managed to drop my shoe in the canal , slightly funny but i was then shoeless at least i get a new pair ! whenever i go on holidays , it makes me reflect i came to realisation that this is what life is all about traveling , experiencing and enjoying i found myself thinking about getting stuck in the same routine and how refreshing this break was in everyday life , you never get a chance to look outside yourself because we 're always so absorbed the little anxiety voice in my head telling me to not do things was silenced for a while too i thought 'just do it' i 've included some pictures below best wishes , amy xx
