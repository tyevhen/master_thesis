i thought i was recovering well from the flu , but for some reason my strength has not returned even worse it seems to be declining i had a few decent days early in last week , but the last three days have been very difficult because of this weakness in my left leg and right arm , i have lost confidence in my ability to stand also , my trunk strength abdomen and back is very weak adding to my difficulties where i normally perform calf stretches , side steps , step ups , and leg swings , i find it difficult to just do side steps then i have to rest then , i can maybe do step ups if i wait long enough , i can do calf stretches i still haven t been able to do any leg swings is the weakness related to the flu or something else ? could it be related to the warfinin ? i need to make an appointment with my doctor to see what is happening perhaps he can figure out why my strength is not returning all i know is that something has to change because the current situation is not manageable living with kennedy s disease is difficult especially as we get older , but this sudden and unexplained loss of strength is something unexpected i need answers
