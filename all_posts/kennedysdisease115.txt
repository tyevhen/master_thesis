the americans with disability act ada has been good for those of us with limited mobility at times , i feel it does not go far enough and perhaps too far at other times , but it is definitely a step pardon the pun in the right direction it provides access for the disabled to most stores and buildings as well as many other places unfortunately , when we are not in the city , many places are still not accessible in most rural communities , there are shops and stores that are converted homes i do not expect the owners of these older places to rebuild entrances or open up inside areas to accommodate a small minority of shoppers visitors yet , there are times that i do miss out on interesting rural shops and museums because the home or building is years old i also enjoy the interesting architecture our family , friends , and neighbors homes are mostly not accessible to me or offer limited access most of these homes have entranceways with several steps and no handrails a few are even split level homes offering no access at all we have a six foot ramp and a threshold ramp that does provide me access to homes with only a few steps one neighbor even went so far as to borrow an eight foot ramp to make certain i could come to his christmas party i miss visiting or having dinner at these non accessible homes i also regret that sometimes people stress out trying to figure a way for me to attend their function most visits and dinners these days have to take place at our house this works most of the time , but places a burden on my wife the host 's role family holidays are also difficult to plan only three of the six family member homes are accessible two of cindy 's sisters have bent over backwards to accommodate me or they just know my wife will not leave me home alone for a holiday one built a ramp from their garage into the house another finished out a room in the basement with lower level access in order for me to attend dinners and functions there one home with access to the main level does not have any restrooms on that floor making for interesting all day events we manage to get by , but logistics plays an important role in the planning process again , i do not expect the world to change because i cannot access someone 's home i am hoping , however , that someday stairs will no longer be such a barrier to me would n't that be wonderful ?
