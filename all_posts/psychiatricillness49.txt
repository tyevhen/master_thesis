i am sick to death of this awful illness ! i ca n't work , i ca n't concentrate and i ca n't do nothing i think i will take walk in the rain ! i ca n't diet cos eating is my only source of comfort and i am rapidly expanding around the waist ! i want out , i just want to be normal , accepted and feel a part of the world rather than an on looker who watches life pass her by
