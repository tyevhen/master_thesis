i had to dump the guy i have been seeing i just knew it was n't going anywhere and it had to be done i feel so bad because he is a nice man and for various reasons a little vulnerable when it comes to relationships it just was not right though and i felt it would be unfair to lead him on any longer i did it face to face though , a first for me i still feel really rotton though not much else to say really , i keep clinging to my belief it is better to be alone than to be with the wrong person my parents reinforce this belief nearly every time i see them i have also spent the few months since i have moved looking forward to a single life and starting to date again now i am more confident i am going to sign up for the next speed dating night , i like the idea of a bit of dating , meeting different men , nothing too serious i hope my mum is not right and i hope i will not be an old maid i'm still looking for my prince and my happy ever after maybe i wont find my fairytale though
