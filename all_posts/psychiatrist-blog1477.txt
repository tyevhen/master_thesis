i 've fallen behind and life has gotten in the way , so i'm going to do a combination post as i catch up on this mostly snow day therapist paul and patient alex have a pissing contest at least this episode did n't hurt to watch alex shows up early , paul lets him in no waiting room alex insists on paying for the extra few minutes of time , and he throws the pro rated fee in dollars and coins down on the table paul says he is demeaning him and showing his contempt what a way to talk to a patient alex wants to discuss his sexual encounter with other patient laura , but first he needs to know if paul has sexual fantasies about his patients paul says he does can i go home now ? we hear again about the unsatisfactory sexual encounter , paul points out some interesting dynamic interpretations to alex as he makes himself espresso , and it seems paul is having a difficult time treating patient man who slept with the patient he fantasizes sleeping with suicidal sophie sophie arrives all decked out up all night , full of tequila , status post bland sex she talks about her mother , the shopping trip that led to the red striped shoes she 's perched upon , her life after cast removal and her return to the gym she does cartwheels and a backflip on paul 's couch , and she talks about how her accident was indeed a suicide attempt while paul rubs her back sophie goes to the bathroom in her state of distress and once again , dr paul is at the door asking are you okay she opens the medicine cabinet , where paul has conveniently left some pills freeze frame and i think they are a narcotic combo pill proll husband picks up that the bottle says baltimore though the area code sits better with my thought that it 's the dc 'burbs she pours the pills into her hands , we are left to assume she 's taken them oh , honey , not with all that tequila on board ! ! and moments later , she passes out as she tries to exit the office what can i say ? husband gives his input it 's about therapy stirring the patient up and what kind of psychologist would leave drugs in the medicine cabinet for his patients ? jake and amy bicker jake and amy bicker not much else happens and i'm not sure what the point of the episode is too much in treatment at once
