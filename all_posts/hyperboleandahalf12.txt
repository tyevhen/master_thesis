every time i write something new , i feel like i need to make it better than whatever i wrote before it so that it never appears as though i am regressing except i kind of feel like the last couple posts i wrote are pretty much the best i'm capable of like maybe i peaked and everything else i'm ever going to do will be a disappointment i wroet that part sober now it 's not so good also the next part so i decided that probably the best thing to do would be to get really , really , really drunk and then write about nothing until any expectations that anyone may have ever had of me are sufficiently loweered then what happened was that i had some little bottles of rum that i got out of a pi ata last summer and they were lying around and then i drank them here 's the illustrated version of what i just said and that 's pretty much what 's happening right now now real drunk starts anyway , i asked twtter and they said i should do this live , so that 's what i'm going to do i do n't even know what i'm going to talk about please still respect me after this , oksay ? update so i decided to draw a graph to better represent the psycholgical predicament i'm this is it basically , a burrito is pretty awesome and then you get a fighter gjet and the burrito is n't so awesome anymore because burritos ca n't fly in the air and kill things from a great distance so my reasoning goes that if i write a post when i'm really drunk , it will be like this update i meant to finish that off by saying that the burrito would then seem more awesome compared to whatever the worst thing ever was maybe a rock like a really , really shitty rock like a rock made out of styrofoam update i jsut realized that i might be setting a bad example for my younger readers kids , this is n't a good idea i made this for you to prove it i am ashamed of that horse if i was n't drunk , i could draw a horse that was at least a thousand times better i'm preactically an expert at drawing horses , so i should know when i was a kid , i used to draw horses , like , every single day update i promise i'm actually really good at drawing hoerses i just drew this horse and i did n't even try it 's a palomino and it 's jumping ! update and this is the reason that posts like this have to happen does this person really think that saying that is going to make me go oh , okay sorry about the delay in quality material i was just messing with you i 'll get right back to making everything exactly up to your specifications sorry dude i ca n't live up to your expectations all of the time sometimes i'm going drink six miniature bottles of rum and then draw horses that 's just the way the world works anyway , guy , i drew you a picture it 's mostly scribbles with a few dots i felt like that you needed to have your expectations lowered i thought about adding some blue , but then i thought fuck that guy he does n't deserve blue i'm not putting any in there update but then i made a drawing with a whole lot of blue for the rest of you just for contrast updtae so i'm sitll really conceredned about the example im' setign that was s lot of typos , but i think i'm going to leave it because it 's honest i 'll try to edit the next part to the best of my ability which is not much ability anyway , i made another drawing to show why drinking is bad there 's no possible way to interpert that positively update wait i found a way but you still should n't drink because even though the upside down , colorless ranbow can turn into a smiley face , it still has five double chins so that 's like , ten chins watch out update there 's a weird point after you 've been drinking for a wihle where things start to turn and get weird after a few hours of drinking , you feel all great and giddy and then there 's a turning point and pretty soon you start contemplating your mortality and the mortality of everything and there 's a creeping feeling that you and everything you know and love is going to die i think i 've almsot reached that point i should probably either drink more , go to bed or eat something really awesome update guess what ? i made more blue for you ! ! ! and i ate a pita shell i feel better update it is now morning and i feel like maybe i accomplished the opposite of what i was trying to accomplish because now i feel even more pressure to perform to make up for this monstrosity anyway , i wo n't delete this rambling testament to my psychological shortcomings , but i think i'm going to move it down the page a little maybe a few posts back , so it 's just buried enough to give me a little peace of mind
