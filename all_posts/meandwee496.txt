dear little p , hi sweet one ! i got back from the doctor a little while ago and i got to see you on the ultrasound ! boy , are you cute ! you waved your arms at me and i noticed they look like real , plump little baby arms ! you are growing so well any chance i get to take a peek at you is a real gift anyway , after seeing you , the doctor came in and told me you already weigh lbs oz and are in the th percentile for your growth he said you are a big baby he did n't seem worried , rather , he was thrilled at how well you are doing and said that your growth may level out later on so just because you seem large now does n't mean you will be the same when you are born i'm just so happy you are thriving and kicking i swore i saw a disco ball in there , but i think you hid it from me at the last second that 's ok , i know you need your own privacy so i wo n't snoop around today they also screened me for gestational diabetes and i 'll find out the results sometime tomorrow i fear your size may have a link to g d but we 'll know for sure later no point worrying yet ! daddy is excited about the appointment as well and he 's looking forward to coming home from work to talk to you and make you wiggle i know how you love his voice you are most active when dad is talking to you he thought he could hear your little heart beating when he listened through my stomach the other night it 's just another way we get to interact with you a little before you come out we 're just so excited ! i have a lot of thoughts on my mind about you and your upcoming arrival , but i wo n't write them all here just now i know your little eyes can only see so much and your mama likes to yammer on and on and on just know that we love you so much and want you to stay safe and warm in your little cocoon for as long as possible we think of you always and love you the same love , mama save you might also like dear little p months old ! two ! linkwithin
