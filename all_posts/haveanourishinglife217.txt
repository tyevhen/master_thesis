this past year , i have not had a real job , to use society s terms my life has been completely occupied with recovery i guess you could say that my full time job has been trying to get healthy when people ask me , what s new ? or what have you been doing lately ? i really just want to say , i have been recovering from depression i know that is not what people want to hear so , i end up saying a form of the word , nothin sometimes , i throw in a joke or two along with my response i say something like , oh , you know , just being a stay at home wife during the day , my grand accomplishments consist of the following getting out of bed , eating breakfast , and brushing my teeth changing out of my sweatpants is a bonus but not a guarantee the same goes for deodorant if i actually left the house , that would be a really good day i wish with my whole heart that i could do more i wish with every fiber of my being that i could be proud of what i do i have been slowly trying to add responsibilities into my schedule sometimes it works , sometimes it does n't right now , the only way my life makes sense to me is if i think of the cross i can unite my suffering with jesus on the cross suffering comes in many forms , not just physical jesus must have endured all types of mental and emotional suffering while he was on this earth for example , just think of the agony in the garden the mental and emotional suffering that i experience cannot even compare to the anguish he had in the garden of gethsemane however , because he suffered , i can unite my agony to his agony and in doing so , amazing things can happen it s humiliating not to have a job i admit that i am struggling with the idea on the outside , i seem perfectly capable of contributing to society it appears that there is no reason why i shouldn t be working i know most of it is in my head , but i can feel the judgment from the working class every time i show my face during the day because i feel this way , i realize that i am again a victim of our society 's standards as a whole , we put way too much value on what we do when you meet someone new , one of the first questions you ask them is so , what do you do ? we have to remember that first and foremost , we have value because we are a human person created by god if we accomplish more or less , it doesn t mean that we are more or less of a human person our worth doesn t come from us or what we do , it comes from god and there is nothing that we can do or that other people can do to us that can take our value away
