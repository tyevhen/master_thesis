i fear my blogability borrowing a neologism from bud commercials has been declining here is the progression of net communication as i see it e mail posting boards listserv , newsgroups blogs my space and facebook twitter video twitter a prediction there are still intimate places on the web , small poetry boards and boards of special concern , and none of these advances precludes the use of a previous one i like e mail best because i hate handling paper i 've been on boards , still attend one i 've been on listservs , none now my blog is self explanatory i joined my space and facebook but only pursued facebook where i now have over mainly literary friends the existence of such platforms naturally cheapens the word , friend my publisher encouraged me to twitter and now i have a tweet deck the time will come when short videos can be posted through twitter links to videos are already possible then we 'll have canned film snippets from personalities falling through the rafters what does this progression say about the net ? first , that things go from private to public quickly second , that associations expand exponentially if you keep playing and third , the greater the audience , the less data shared , which results in the trivializing of life to buzz words and sound bites and branding do n't we brand cattle ? it 's a dehumanizing process that began with the telegraph nevertheless we can overcome it and preserve intimacy within it , for which e mails and small boards thankfully remain as obtains in poetry today , where we have too many poets and not enough readers , on the web we have too many platforms and not enough players think of the demise of ringo we have more people inventing platforms than people that can use them speaking of poetry , here 's a new poem , one of the thirty i wrote in april for national poetry month flowers of heraclitus i watch the garden too much hoping for it to happen the deer could undo it all last year they savaged the cabbage , cropped the snapdragons and beheaded the broccoli this year i planted only flowers mainly of the daisy family , deer and drought resistant i watch the garden too much heraclitus explained we only notice change as too much part of what is changing the observer becomes oblivious if only i could return in two weeks to see the changes , but who would watch over the garden meanwhile ? i watch the garden too much in the late afternoon the sun curls around the cypress , lighting the plants a second time copper daisy , heliotrope , princess flower their time will come , while all time belongs to weeds , the wild radish , nettles , mint and wild cucumber and in all these no real tropes except the hands of a gardener , the dirt beneath the nails i poke at with a toothbrush i have several new interviews out at romantic blogs , emphasizing the love poems in my book here 's one kristina knight i also fired my web publicist for the book , as he had only pursued general web promotion and never gotten me a single reading or sold a single book in marketing nowadays you start with the personality and then try to sell the product at least in the arts i want the book to speak for itself , why readings are so salutary i have readings coming up in sf and la and sd in june and july if anyone reading this blog has knowledge of more west coast venues , please send them my way while reading my poetry to an audience i feel a wholeness , as if this was what i was meant to do how good is that ? bouncing between kilorats and kiloneutral ,
