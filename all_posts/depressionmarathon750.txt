i have the best readers in the world your comments on the last two posts were poignant , thoughtful and inspiring i appreciate what you had to say you gave me a lot to think about thank you i'm trying to move on speaking of moving on , i only have weeks left before the dallas marathon i had a really tough x meters speed workout yesterday , and i will run my final miler on saturday it 's hard to believe i 'll be starting my taper soon usually i'm totally wiped out by this stage of training , but i'm feeling really good running only days per week has definitely paid off in the training arena it will be interesting to see how it works in the race one thing is certain , racing should be easier now that i'm pounds lighter yes , that 's right i 've lost pounds since beginning the weight watchers online program in august i'm sure the weight loss is one of the reasons i'm recovering better from my training it 's also the reason my clothes , including my running clothes , fit better i even had to go shopping to buy some new pants , as my current stock was getting a bit large ! how fun ! i feel better physically and mentally and running is definitely easier without the extra pounds i do n't miss them at all ! that 's about all i have for now take care my friends
