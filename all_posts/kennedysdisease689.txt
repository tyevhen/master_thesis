i ve written about the benefits of maintaining a gratitude journal a few times in the past i use mine every day no , i don t write everything down that i am thankful for , but it is the springboard for building a habit of giving thanks today , saying thank you to someone , to something , to myself , or to god is ingrained in my life initially , giving thanks started out as my recognition of important or major events over time , my cognition of things i am grateful for has grown now , i find myself saying thank you regularly throughout the day , often for what would have seemed unimportant or just expected a few years ago there are even times when things haven t gone well that i pause to evaluate what took place in an attempt to see the good in the experience b k clive said it best today , just take time to smell the roses , enjoy those little things about your life , your family , spouse , friends , and job forget about the thorns the pains and problems they cause you and enjoy life this morning , as i write this post , i am thankful for all of you who follow and comment on my articles you inspire me if you are interested in learning more about a gratitude journal , check out the links below http kennedysdisease blogspot com what living with means to me html http kennedysdisease blogspot com feeling grateful for what you already html http kennedysdisease blogspot com my companions html http kennedysdisease blogspot com radical gratitude html
