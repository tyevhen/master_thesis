i'm having a sleep day today this happens every once in awhile , and it has been a little while since the last one i just ca n't wake up i am sleepy , tired , and heavy basically , the only comfortable place is in bed , asleep and no matter how much i sleep , i can easily sleep some more i just got up from my third nap for crying out loud ! i guess i should have known something was up when i fell asleep at last night after sleeping hours , i figured i was in for a good day however , after my usual morning oatmeal , coffee , and sportscenter , i needed a nap i thought maybe i just overdid it yesterday i helped some friends carry bricks and build a path but that must not have been the problem , because the sleepiness just wo n't stop perhaps this is what i was supposed to do today after all , there is a law and order marathon on usa it 's drizzly and gray outside the one appointment i had was cancelled everything lined up for a tired , sleepy day and my body wo n't let me do otherwise whew i think i need a nap
