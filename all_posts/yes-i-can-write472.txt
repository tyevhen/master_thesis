today i got a haircut ! ! i still look like a hippie though p it 's all curly and bouncy me like we very briefly visited my grandma , then visited my grandpa 's grave since today is the th anniversary of his death not a cheerful anniversary i love the jewish custom of leaving a small stone on the headstone it feels more personal being able to leave something more lasting than flowers at a grave after we picked my dad up from the airport , i started sorting my clothes , since i need to pack ! we 're heading to our cottage saturday , that day is very rapidly approaching , and we are most certainly not ready ! as soon as i get the time , i want to make a video blog post type thing , and post it on youtube hopefully that will happen soon listening to today day three pain by ayreon an absolutely fricken amazing song and band project ! ! you might also like the year the language that we use matters why schooled people i want to unschool , but what if my kids just watch tv growing up unschooled with siblings linkwithin
