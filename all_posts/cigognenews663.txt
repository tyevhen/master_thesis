in the era of freud and psychoanalysis the linchpin of the therapy was the analysis of transference how the patient responds to the doctor and counter transference how the doctor reacts to the patient the whole idea was to change the patient through a corrective emotional relationship helping her to be more independent , not rely for advice or love and guidance from the doctor now decades later , that notion of the corrective emotional experience has gained many adherents it is still in essence the analysis of transference their theory is the following it is not enough to relive early trauma , you must follow it with a corrective experience that will allow the patient to make progress and change they believe that allowing the patient to wallow in pain only reinforces neurosis so why not have a new ending to a feeling memory ? because it is not real it is a concocted scenario that defies the patient s reality it is not our job to rewrite history it is enough to help patients learn about themselves and their history but is it true that patients who relive without rewriting the ending continue to suffer and be neurotic ? one could only come to that conclusion in the absence of clinical experience what we have seen year after year is that reliving in and of itself leads to profound changes in the neurologic , psychologic and physiological systems over and over in double blind studies there have been changes in brain functioning , hormone secretion and , above all , changes how the patient feels about himself and his world there is a systematic alteration in body temperature and blood pressure , lower which does not happen in those who abreact that is , there is practically no change in those who fail to connect their feeling to conscious awareness i call that abreaction , a discharge of the energy of the feeling on a different level of consciousness in symbolic channels it is a random event that does not follow neurologic evolutionary functioning the problem is that so many clinics and mental health professionals claim to be doing primal therapy yet the results seem to be that the patient continues to suffer hence , the notion that patients after a reliving wallow in pain if only the higher level is addressed and even resolved on that level it does look like the patient is wallowing in pain without having the theory and techniques to go deeper it can lead to misinterpretation of what is happening providing a different ending depends on the unconscious of the doctor who needs to supply it clearly this is not an organic affair , emanating out the patient and her unconscious and what about if each doctor provides the corrective emotional experience in a different way ? are there several different scenarios for the patient ? implicit in this is that the doctor knows best whereas it is the patient and her unconscious who knows best if there were no connection we would not see systematic changes in cortisol levels in our patients clearly , reliving is sufficient but it must be a true reliving and it is clear that when we provide the script for the patient reliving is not really reliving it is rewriting history it is the fulfillment of need on the part of the therapist who is supplying a good script with a happy ending is that our job ? to cheerlead the patient away from reality ? to help him lead a symbolic life ? it is perforce a happy ending because why else would we want to channel the patient away from imprinted reality ? it is that reality that has been driving the patient to act out , develop migraines and high blood pressure and remain unable to relax he , in his constant behavior is doing exactly that trying to produce a happy ending for himself so he can get out of pain it is that reality that makes a patient exhibits himself in public time and again , or bedeviled by an inability to orgasm or to shy away from all human contact we have all heard by now of erectile dysfunction the penis is not the problem the brain is it is history that largely determines all this and responding to that history instead of repressing it is what leads to liberation how do we do that ? penetrating the deeper levels in a slow methodical manner after all , when a doctor prescribes zoloft for a patient he is producing a happy ending instead of feeling pain the patient has become , la candide , egregiously sanguine he is happy now , or is he ? his stress hormone level is still very high unconsciously he is not happy but he has convinced himself that he is but that delusion will kill him or make him prey to serious disease too early in life repression to me is the number one killer in our population when we supply a happy ending we are aiding repression we are aiding delusions by the patient we as therapists have become cheerleaders , trying to find a happy ending for our role as doctor it is a mutually shared delusion that fits into the zeitgeist where we all want to put on a happy face so we do and then try to develop a rationale for our choice we don t have to redo history the patient , after having made his unconscious conscious will rewrite his own scenario as time goes on he will lead a different life the exhibitionist will stop showing himself this , with simply reliving his pain don t forget that the deep experience of a feeling leads to the cortical understanding of it automatically in my jargon it is the third line component of the feeling there are so many levels to pain that a person can relive higher representations of it and still have enough pain to continue to be driven by it it is not that the therapy is faulty it is because the road is longer than we thought it may be because a therapist has not acknowledged the depth of pain nor has she produced the techniques necessary to probe down deep that she can believe in the happy ending it took many years for us to develop those deep probing techniques so i am not judging therapists , but i do know what it takes to go to the antipodes of the unconscious it is not a trip taken lightly because meddling in the deep unconscious requires precision in one s therapy it is not that everyone does what they feel comfortable with it means adhering to very specific clues and following them back into history in an ordered manner when one of my students shows a tape of his therapy on other students , which we do systematically we know immediately when a mistake has taken place there will not be integration so there are two different ways to go amiss to believe what is not there to refuse to believe what is there it is when the doctor forces the patient into too much pain that he must supply a new ending if therapists have not seen what connection can do , then they forcibly choose a happy ending script if the doctor does not force the issue and drive up out of sequence pain , there is no need for a different ending connection says and does it all
