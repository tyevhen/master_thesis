i'm still struggling my mood remains very low i attended my step meeting yesterday morning , but i ended up feeling alone in a crowd i hate that feeling it 's so painful i began to cry and could n't stop , so i left early sitting in my vehicle after i left i cried for a long , long time i felt utter despair that despair was just a continuation of the despair i communicated to my friend , wendy , via text message , as i laid in bed late the previous night in that message , i communicated feeling as if i was in solitary confinement depression , i think , creates this feeling of alone ness whether lying alone in bed or sitting in the midst of a room full of boisterous people , the isolation i feel right now is excruciating utter despair combined with utter isolation , it 's easy to see how depression can kill suicide is not a topic i broach very often in this blog it 's not an option yet it 's easy , at times like these , to contemplate the meaning behind this pain and isolation i admit , in my despair my brain gravitates toward thoughts of life and death and i believe i have a greater understanding of why some with depression find it difficult , in the midst of this despair , to justify staying alive this is a cruel illness i know i 've gained perspective and opportunity as a result of battling depression , but at this moment in time , it 's pretty tough to feel anything but cruelty and despair i'm doing my best , dear readers , to hang on tight , to put one foot in front of the other , and to take the next right action it would be easier to stop , but forward is the only way to go moving forward is difficult , and i wish the path was clearer , but i guess this is my path right now i do n't have to like it , and i do n't , but i 'll keep doing my best to walk through it it will get better it always does it feels impossible , but i have to remember that
