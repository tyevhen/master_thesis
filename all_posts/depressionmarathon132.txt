it 's the day after the weekend of my th high school reunion i did n't go from the looks of it , via facebook , i missed a lot of fun does facebook ever make anyone feel good ? anyway , today i am feeling a bit of regret to go or not to go was a really tough decision it was complicated as i wrote in an earlier post , i was worried about all of my lost memories from those days that worry was confirmed when i did n't recognize of the people in the photos on facebook yes , part of the reason was everyone looked different at age than they did at , but i did n't recognize most of the names either ! i figured at least their names would be familiar , but most of them were n't that was strange and disconcerting my other consideration regarding going or not going was the fact that i actually did n't graduate with my class after my suicide attempt of the way into my junior year , i went to live in a foster home in another town i missed my senior year with the classmates i had been with since junior high school and although i was included in the class reunion facebook group , i was n't sure how i 'd be accepted seems silly to be worried about fitting in years later , but it was a factor in my decision not to attend another factor which i weighed heavily was what i perceived to be a large focus on alcohol in the lead up to the weekend , many facebook posts focused on drinking , partying , and getting drunk i'm sober , but my concern was not at all that i 'd be tempted to drink i was , however , concerned i might be bored , uncomfortable , or just not have much fun since getting sober , i have n't found attending parties where people are doing a lot of celebratory drinking very interesting for very long i'm not a prude , but sometimes it is challenging to be the only one not uninhibited in a room full of uninhibited people i do n't feel like i'm missing out on anything it 's just not interesting or even fun after awhile despite all these reservations , i was still contemplating attending right up until last friday , which was the first day of the reunion i considered driving up late friday night or early saturday morning in order to attend the saturday activities , of which there were many and perhaps if the reunion had n't been at least hours away , i would have gone in the end , i decided the time and effort of getting there and back , on a congested , construction zone riddled highway , in combination with all my other reservations about attending it just was n't worth it of course i then spent the last three days looking at continually updated facebook posts their pictures conveyed loads of fun and a fair amount of alcohol their words confirmed they not only had a blast , they were grateful for the time together the words of my classmates , more than their pictures , made me think twice about the decision i made not to attend i 'll never know if i would have had fun and felt included , or if i would have been disinterested and felt uncomfortable the right decision ? who knows but i am feeling a bit of regret
