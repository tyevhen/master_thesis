in a prior article , narcissism an emotional seesaw between grandiosity and shame , i discussed how the grandiosity that people with narcissistic traits exhibit is often a cover up for an internal sense of shame in this article , i'm focusing on the challenges for people in relationships with partners who have narcissistic traits a relationship with a narcissistic partner can have a negative impact on your self esteem being in a relationship with a person who has narcissistic traits can be difficult over time , a person with narcissistic traits can affect the way you feel about yourself let 's first look at some of the characteristics of people who have narcissistic traits a sense of entitlement and a need to be the center of attention people with narcissistic traits often feel that they should be treated like they 're special they often feel that they should be the center of attention and that other people should fulfill their needs often immediately they feel easily slighted often , if they 're not the center of attention and they ca n't get others to pay attention to them , they become angry because they 're not getting their way or they might become dismissive of the situation i really did n't like these people anyway as a defense against feeling slighted a need to dominate the conversation people with narcissistic traits like to dominate conversations to talk about themselves often , they can go on and on without noticing that they have n't allowed other people to talk if you happen to disagree with what they 've said , they can feel emotionally injured and get angry or indignant at that point , they might ignore you and talk on as if they did n't hear you , dismiss what you 've said or insist that they 're right even when they 're not a lack of respect for others many people with narcissistic traits are so self centered that they feel they 're not accountable when it comes to certain rules or social etiquette they feel the rules do n't apply to them because they 're special and if you ca n't see how special they are , they feel there 's something wrong with you that you do n't see it this goes along with a sense of entitlement a need to impress people with narcissistic traits often like to impress or charm others to get compliments or recognition this might include how they look including , for women , breast enlargement or liposuction to attract men and to feel more attractive than other women , financial gains , career status or bragging about knowing important people this might also include overspending on things that they ca n't afford , like a luxury car , in order to gain status or appear that they have more money than they actually have a lack of empathy one of the most challenging traits for someone who is in a relationship with a person with narcissistic traits is their lack of empathy empathy allows you to put yourself in the other person 's shoes to try to understand what 's going on with him or her because the person with narcissistic traits is self centered , s he often has a hard time empathizing with someone else when you 're around someone who is especially narcissistic , it can feel like you 're alone because this person is unable to tune in to what 's going on with you and , sometimes , lacks interest in doing this a need to blame others for their problems it 's not unusual for people with narcissistic traits to blame others for their problems rather than taking responsibility for a mistake , they find a way to blame someone else if you 're in a relationship with someone like this , you will probably be the one that is often blamed i would n't have forgotten if you had reminded me it 's your fault their underlying shame makes it difficult for them to own their mistakes see below an underlying sense of shame even though people with narcissistic traits might exhibit grandiose behavior , it 's often a cover for a sense of shame that they hide see my prior article about narcissism often , they did n't get the emotional attunement that they needed as children which can lead to a deep sense of shame the traits that i 've described above tend to be the most dominant characteristics of people who are narcissistic not everyone has every trait or every trait to the highest degree there can be variations on the theme the following scenario , which is a composite of many different cases with all identifying information changed , illustrates how being in a relationship with a narcissistic person can have a negative impact on your self esteem ann when ann met john at a party , she thought he was the handsomest , most charming and intelligent man that she had ever met he also had a great sense of humor and he made her laugh the whole night she felt captivated by his charm and wit she could see that other men and women at the party were also riveted by him as well during the first few months of dating , ann had a wonderful time with john not only was he a lot of fun , but he took her to the best restaurants in the city and they got special service he was also very generous with her a relationship with a narcissistic partner can have a negative impact on your self esteem ann was also amazed at all of his accomplishments first in his class in college , captain of the football team , and a quick rise to the top at his company everything seemed to be going well until one night when they were at dinner and ann disagreed with something that john said they happened to be talking about an area that was ann 's area of expertise , history , and john attributed a particular quote to the wrong person ann thought she was being gentle and tactful when she told him who actually said the quote , but john 's mood suddenly switched from being light and funny to being angry and sharp with ann he insisted that he was right and ann was wrong she was shocked because she had never seen john like this before ann did n't want to make a big deal out of this , so she told him that it did n't matter and it might be better to talk about something else but john would n't let it go , and he insisted that he was right and that she was wrong he also insisted that ann acknowledge this ann managed to change the subject but , afterwards , when she got home , she wondered about this she came away feeling uncomfortable and wondered why it had been so important to john to be right to satisfy her curiosity , she looked up the quote and she saw that she was right , but she decided not to bring this up with john because she did n't want to get into it again ann thought that john was probably having an off moment and decided to forget about it a few days later , ann and john got together with her friends , mary and ed this was the first time that ann 's friends were meeting john , and ann hoped that everyone would like each other soon after the introductions , john asked ed what type of car he drove when ed told him that he drove a honda , john laughed and told ed that he drove a mercedes benz , he has always had a mercedes and he would n't think of driving anything else a relationship with a narcissistic partner can have a negative impact on your self esteem there was an pause in the conversation and ann felt uncomfortable she could see that john was behaving in a competitive way with ed and it made her feel uneasy then , ed changed the subject and they began talking about sports at one point , john interrupted ed to tell everyone that when he had been the captain of his college football team , professional scouters were interested in him , but he injured himself so he did n't join a pro team but if it had n't been for that injury , he surely would be on a pro team now without giving anyone else a chance to talk , john continued to talk about himself even though he did n't become a pro football player , he is very successful and makes a lot of money then , he proceeded to go over all of his career accomplishments he spent the rest of the night grandstanding going on and on , john did n't notice that both mary and ed 's eyes were glazed over and they were suppressing yawns ann felt so surprised and embarrassed that by the time they were considering dessert , she told them that she had a headache and she thought it would be best if they left early john made a big deal of picking up the check , much to mary 's and ed 's annoyance , but john did n't notice that they were annoyed his attention was on the waiter , who thanked john profusely for the generous tip ann could see how gratifying this was to john when ann got home , she felt upset that john had been so self centered and obnoxious , so she decided to talk to john about it when she saw him the next time , which was a few days later before ann could even broach the topic , john asked her why she was friends with mary and ed ann was taken aback by this question and asked him why he was asking her this to which john responded that he did n't see anything special about them they seemed boring to him and they clearly were n't able to understand or appreciate his accomplishments because they did n't seem impressed at that point , ann could feel her face getting flush with anger she told john that mary had been her friend since high school and she had been a very supportive and caring friend throughout their friendship together and ed was one of the kindest people that she knew and she was happy for mary when she met him she told john that she felt angry and offended with how john was measuring their worth john laughed sarcastically and told ann that he was surprised that ann would be interested in hanging out with losers he told her that all of his friends were highly successful with a lot of money , expensive cars and expensive houses he would n't even consider being friends with people like mary and ed then ann asked him , then why are you interested in being with me ? and he responded , because you 're beautiful and you 're successful in your career ann noticed that these attributes were external and , to her , external attributes were a lot less important than someone 's internal attributes like being kind and caring to others she realized that john not only did n't see or care about those attributes , but he did n't see them in her this was the beginning of the end for ann she told him that she realized that they were two very different people with different values and she did n't want to see him anymore for a few weeks after that , ann received angry , hurtful messages on her voicemail from john he told her that if she did n't see what a good catch he was , then she must be a loser too even though ann knew that john was a much more shallow person than she realized , his words hurt her when she first met john , she did n't see his narcissism narcissistic partners ann saw john with another woman shortly after the breakup a days after she broke up with him , ann saw john with another woman he seemed like he was being his most charming self he did n't seem to be broken hearted about ann he did n't even notice her ann began therapy a month later to try to deal with the breakup during her therapy , ann realized that john 's charm and attentiveness to her were meant to get her attention so she would like him it was all a show the charm , the wit , the gifts to get her to admire him , and if she was n't admiring him , he could n't tolerate it and she was of no use to him she realized that she was n't a real person to him to him , she only existed to the extent that she would admire him and because she was beautiful , he saw her as a trophy on his arm for other men to admire him for being with her , another form of self aggrandizement for him during therapy , ann was able to make connections between john and her father , who also had many of the same traits she realized that since she grew up with someone who was narcissistic , john seemed familiar to her but she knew now that she did n't want to be taken in again by another narcissistic man conclusion people with narcissistic traits , whether they possess all the traits outlined above or some of them , often do n't show their narcissistic characteristics at first similar to john , they are often charming and witty and people want to be around them because they 're fun the problem is that after a while , people with narcissistic traits reveal these characteristics in way that are detrimental to the people around them what might have seemed , at first , like fun often turns out to be a way to seek attention from others sooner or later , their sense of entitlement and lack of empathy , among other traits , come to light so , it 's not unusual for them to have problems having close friendships , romantic relationships or collegial relationships because many people wo n't put up with them in situations where the person with narcissistic traits is a boss or the head of a company , s he often knows how to defer to the people above them higher ups , people on the board or shareholders , but their subordinates suffer under their reign although this article 's vignette happened to
