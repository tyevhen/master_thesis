can you identify the living fossil ? there seems to be a growing perception , not unlike the controversies surrounding flash , that adobe 's portable document format is in the modern world of the web a legacy format , something of a living fossil , a technological coelacanth that refuses to become extinct some would go so far as to say pdf does n't belong on the web some would be wrong , however my current employer , day software , has how shall i say this in politically correct form ? a strong prejudice in favor of html as the one true and proper web format for documents this is reflected in the fact that all of day 's product documentation like just about everything else day produces , information wise is available online as html there are those at day , i'm sure , who would like to see pdf disappear from web sites , if not from planet earth html is a bit of a religion around day and yet , when i joined day as an employee two weeks ago , not one document in the half inch thick stack of new employee paperwork that i was asked to fill out was based on an html form every single document was based on a pdf so what is this walking fossil called pdf and why is it still so pervasive ? in the beginning , there was postscript far and away the most successful adobe technology ever created , postscript was the first commercially successful page description language based on vector graphics it 's a turing complete language with subroutines , looping , branching , and all the rest amazingly , it continues to inhabit printers worldwide you probably rely on a postscript driver to get your printer to work it 's a brilliant bit of technology , describing , as it does , fonts and shapes and whole pages in resolution independent terms , in a plain text non binary interpreted language write once , rasterize anywhere since fonts themselves can be described in postscript , and since postscript is just text , you 'd think ps would be the ideal self contained document format alas , it is not it 's far too verbose , and laborious to render onscreen this is what killed display postscript still , its inherent portability made postscript a compelling basis for a document format so adobe went on a quest to make postscript smaller and more amenable to quick screen rendering they reduced the number of operators and made their names smaller , and cut out subroutines , and eliminated loops , and did a bunch of other things designed to make postscript small and screen friendly , yet without sacrificing portability the result was pdf the first generation of pdf was ascii based , and if you looked inside it you basically saw thinly disguised postscript commands , with loops unrolled and major page elements described as objects references to objects were maintained in offset tables fonts could be embedded , or not it was still a somewhat verbose format , but at least it could be interpreted and rendered quickly , onscreen or to a printer the translation from pdf to postscript is extremely straightforward adobe came up with a free reader program and put pdf files out there for anyone who wanted to give them a try lo and behold , the format took off why ? why does the world need something like pdf ? the sad , to some answer is that there is still a need in the world for electronic documents that mimic paper documents there are industries such as insurance in which the physical size and placement of certain pieces of text is regulated by law , and many forms have to fit on a certain size piece of paper when printed out there 's zero tolerance for text autowrap variations form from irs has to look like form , every time imagine the pandemonium at irs if every tax form that arrived in the mail looked different because it was printed out on a different printer at a different resolution , with text wrapping every which way , all manner of font substitutions , etc like it or not , certain documents have to look a certain way every time , without fail this is where pdf shines is pdf right for every occasion ? no it 's not no more than html is is pdf going to become obsolete ? not any time soon not any more than postscript can should pdf coexist with markup languages in the world of the web ? i think the answer is yes adobe has done a good job of making online pdf forms for example rest friendly and user friendly having to load reader or a reader plug in for your browser is a bit of a hassle , but you do get a lot of bang for the buck the advantages of pdf tend to balance out the disadvantages for certain users , in certain situations and that 's the key it 's not about religion it 's not about whose document format is inherently better or worse it 's about diversity and choice choosing the right tool for the job and letting the user or customer choose what 's right for her this is the part that the html zealots do n't get some customers want pdf some users demand to have documents in a format that looks nice onscreen and prints out nicely and predictably on a printer by not providing those users with that choice , we 're in essence forcing a technology decision on people we 're forcing our religion on non converts and historically , that 's always been a dangerous thing to do
