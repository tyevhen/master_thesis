a sleep study that 's what my doc and i decided today we were discussing my increasing fatigue of course , i want it to be caused by anything other than depression ! something fixable , please ! ! ! i inquired about sleep apnea after noting a couple recent experiences while napping i 've been nearly awakened by my own gasping for breath the gasping was accompanied by significant anxiety the kind of anxiety you feel when you ca n't breathe the gasping anxiety cycle repeated until i finally woke up , frustrated and unrested fortunately , there is a sleep expert in my psychiatrist 's office , so i will be having a sleep study soon is it wrong to wish for a diagnosis ? ? ?
