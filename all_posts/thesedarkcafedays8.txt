i ca n't sleep i'm tossing and turning , the way my mind has been going back and forth these last few weeks since i left him i hate this job i hate this state of unknowing i want to go home but i also want to stay so i can experience more up here before i have to go back to my normal place i finally was able to see a therapist yesterday i was so excited because i 've been wanting more and more to work on these doubts and hurts that have been plaguing me , to work through this relationship that has been consuming my thoughts the woman hit me with a barrage of questions about where i was working and living and what career i wanted to pursue and whether that was really my passion i tried to patiently answer them , understanding she probably wants to get a sense of where i am in life but i was frustrated because this was not what i wanted to talk about , and i tried to broadcast that but she was n't seeming to pick up on that i missed my old therapist who i just clicked with and who got me , which made me miss this man who i just clicked with and who was so perceptive of my needs i finally told her i was here mainly because of a relationship i had developed over the summer months that meant a lot to me but was now kind of stuck she just told me that i needed to ask him if he had any time free to hang out and leave it in his hands and if he said he was busy , i probably needed to move on and focus on my own life i nodded but explained that i was confused because he had said he was too busy once to see me and then another time he had come up to the area right next to me and not offered to get together it made me question whether he wanted to get together eventually she told me that i needed to focus on clarifying my own direction in life and my own needs and working on my self esteem , and once i did that , i would find the right person i told her that a lot of people had told me that she laughed i wanted to scream if i had a dollar for every time i had gotten that bullshit advice for one thing , i hate being told i need to focus on myself and work on my self esteem do n't just assume that because i want a boyfriend , that means i do n't have good self worth i like myself i also like other people the two are n't mutually exclusive also , both these concepts of focusing on yourself and self esteem are so nebulous , i do n't really even know what they mean i feel like a lot of mediocre and bad therapy can rely on these sorts of catch phrases my session ended with an exhortation to , live in the present moment as my mom said , what if the present moment sucks ? i recognize i'm driving myself crazy worrying about this guy i also recognize that i hate the place that i am in in life right now , but i do n't know whether it 's worth staying or not i realize i probably just need to bite the bullet and ask this guy whether he wants to get together or really is n't interested i need to let go , but my fingers are clenched so tightly around this i do n't know how to move this forward and i hate trying to have to read his mind i guess if he were interested , i would n't have to but i just really want things to work for once and i realize that once you find someone who made you so happy in the present moment , it 's stupid to let them go without a fight
