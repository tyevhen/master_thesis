oh , no , i did it again , i posted over roy ! i swear , i did n't know scroll down for his post we like to talk about subjects where the lines get blurry who should get care ? when is it an illness ? xanax ? seroquel ? which side of the fence and how far over might one lean ? so here 's an interesting cover story in the sunday new york times magazine when is a pain doctor a drug pusher ? it 's the story of a pain doctor who has been sentenced to years in prison for his sloppy and questionable prescribing practices the article 's author , tina rosenberg , comes at it with the tone that it 's outrageous that he was sent to jail , deemed a criminal , for his lax practice bad doctoring , she contends , is cause for civil malpractice litigation , not criminal prosecution the docs who prescribe in exchange for sex or drugs , they are the criminals the doctor in the story did none of those things she makes the point that the standards for prescribing narcotics , especially to a chronic and drug tolerant population of pain patients who may be peppered with occasional abusers are purposely not stated , and leave the doctor open to both scrutiny and criminal charges there are red flags that indicate possible abuse or diversion patients who drive long distances to see the doctor , or ask for specific drugs by name , or claim to need more and more of them but people with real pain also occasionally do these things the doctor s dilemma is how to stop the diverters without condemning other patients to suffer unnecessarily , since a drug diverter and a legitimate patient can look very much alike the dishonest prescriber and the honest one can also look alike society has a parallel dilemma how to stop drug dealing doctors without discouraging real ones and worsening america s undertreatment of pain but such guidelines are futile while there is one pain specialist for , at the very least , every several thousand chronic pain sufferers nationwide and even though pain is an exciting new specialty , doctors are not flocking to it the federation of state medical boards calls fear among physicians that they will be investigated , or even arrested , for prescribing controlled substances for pain one of the two most important barriers to pain treatment , alongside lack of understanding various surveys of physicians have shown that this fear is widespread the bottom line is , doctors say they don t need this , said heit they re in a health care system that wants them to see a patient every to minutes they don t have time to take a complete history about whether the patient has been addicted the fear is very real and palpable that if they prescribe schedule ii opioids they will come under the scrutiny of the d e a , and they don t need this aggravation by the time i finished this article , i was glad i'm not a pain doc i was even more glad i'm not a pain patient
