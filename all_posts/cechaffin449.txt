anxiety you know it in your stomach when you wake , almost like hunger but a different feel like being driven by the winds of hell forward and forward and forward until you break or want to break , but anxiety won t allow a total breakdown , it would lose its grip content yourself with the almost trembling lip know you can live in any time but now time future runs ahead , you eat its dust time past is pure regret , paralysis and all your hours of self analysis can never re create a basic trust you wonder if as an infant it was better not if your mother raised you by the letter three steps forward , two steps back , so it is in my sputtering depression yesterday i took a turn for the worse i don t know why my medications didn t change i suspect the change to standard time had something to do with it , as contrary to the usual symptoms of depression , which get better at night , mine got worse driving home from my html class i really felt like weeping but what for ? for bad chemicals ? they don t deserve my tears i had planned to go fishing today but don t feel safe in leaving home it s good to be near kathleen oh , i can take the heroic route and force myself to fish , but there would be no pleasure in it save the knowledge that i can do nearly anything while depressed , but i know that already it s just a matter of the psychic price one must pay often an activity can briefly lift you out of yourself , which is good , but my computer class last night filled me with anxiety about all the things i don t know and how hopeless it appeared that i shall ever be able to construct a rudimentary web page i m tired , i m confused , i fear falling down the mineshaft again i ve never had such a rocky recovery from depression usually i just flip out of it when the meds kick in i m tired of living with it i m tired of anxiety and hopelessness i m tired of getting my head above water for a few days and being dunked back into it depression truly sucks i know it s halloween today , which marks the end of the month , a month in which i ve written a sonnet nearly every day as part of my mental toilette perhaps an interested reader can suggest whether i ought to persist in sonnets or change the form for november i am not trying to write great poetry , simply a sonnet a day to bolster my sanity at kilorats , craig erick
