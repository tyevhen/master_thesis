hey there ! now that the playroom is done i thought i 'd post some new photos of it with the play kitchen in place and all paige 's holiday toys put away i also avoided using the wide angle lens for this so it does n't distort the room to answer an earlier question from a reader , the room size , i believe , is x feet sidenote if anyone wants to know more about some of the stuff in here , try checking out the topics column on the right of this blog under playroom for wee i tagged all the posts about this room with that to make it easy to find info or you can feel free to email me at the address listed on the upper right since everything has its place , it 's easy to clean up at the end of the day and keep it looking like this some days i do n't feel like it so the floor has scattered books and bits on it , but for the most part we like to pick it up and keep it looking new we also added a mirror to the wall where paige can admire herself during dress up which so far means donning a bunch of cheapy necklaces and watching them swish back and forth and we play mimicking games she also likes to watch her mouth move as she tries to babble and sound out words so cute ! the thing in the left corner in the toy zone is not a tv it 's a lamp that looks like an aquarium paige is very visual and loves fish so it was easy to decide to get it i often find her staring at it and waving hi to her little fishy friends especially when she 's a little tired and needs extra soothing i'm glad we changed the office into her playspace we are in there all day long with plenty to do with no temptation of the television in the family room i know paige enjoys having her own place to go and be cozy and where we can all play , make art , make music , read , and enjoy being together and that was my goal mission accomplished ! save
