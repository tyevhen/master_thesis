dinah , i still love you even though you ignore my opinion and write about in treatment a while ago dinah wrote about why she hates the television show house i did n't have strong opinions about the show , i had only watched a few episodes and i thought they were ok if dinah hated it and wanted to blog about it that was cool with me so now , i'm taking my turn in the interests of full disclosure , i 'll tell you first that i 've never had cable tv not only that , but since about last july i have n't had a television i really have n't missed it i 've been to places that had cable tv and what i saw just reinforced the idea that there was a lot of content that just was n't worth watching i spent more time channel surfing than viewing so that 's my disclaimer i watched the first week of in treatment on the internet in general i think it 's a bit unsettling to be immersed in tv culture i notice it more now that i'm not part of the american viewership , but it feels odd to go somewhere and listen to people absorbed by characters who are n't real and life stories that do n't actually exist i mean really , there are earthquakes and wars and important international events going on and we 're wondering who is going to get voted off american idol ? do n't we have real issues to talk about ? as far as the show specifically , i do n't like it because it 's neither treatment nor is it therapy face it , the guy 's a goofball whether he 's a psychiatrist , a psychologist or a licensed angel adjuster if you 're going to be that far off base from reality you might as well write a show around the complicated dysfunctional relationships between an auto mechanic and his customers oh wait , there was that taxi series that 's pretty close it 's too laughable to be drama and too self important to be comedy like i said when it first came on , i 'd rather have a more realistic series about seriously mentally ill folks making their way in the world than a gossipy pseudo introspective contrivance like in treatment dinah did n't like house because the doctor was obnoxious and the show was n't realistic oddly enough , the same reasons i do n't like in treatment i 'd even prefer blog posts about ducks
