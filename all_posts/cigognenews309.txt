if we have to ask professionals , i guess not here is what the president of the society for psychotherapy research has to say there is strong evidence for many approaches now what does that mean ? that many approaches are all valid ? that they are scientific ? how could that be ? you mean that there are many sciences in psychotherapy , all valid ? are there many different sciences in physics , in biology ? there may be some difference of opinion but certainly not different sciences i mean is there gravity or not ? are there many ways to make electricity ? let me go back to my internship in a major freudian clinic hacker psychiatric clinic there was no science in what we did we all had different freudian interpretations of patients was he id dominant ? was his superego too strong ? was there evidence of his childhood sexuality ? and on and on no science , only guesswork and imagination and there was imagination at work as our staff spun incredible theories to explain the patient s behavior there was certainly no science to guide us in how to proceed in psychotherapy i think that there cannot be many valid approaches to psychotherapy either there is a scientific approach or there isn t i now must offer our approach which i think is science at work we can predict what happens to patients and what level of conscious they are on we can predict the demarche of the therapy , how it should proceed , and what steps we should take we understand immediately when a symptom such as high blood pressure or a migraine appears above all , we know when a therapist makes a mistake our staff can look at a tape , and we always tape patients , and know when something went wrong why ? because there is a precision to what we do that allows no margin to go off and do something else yes there is leeway in terms of the therapist and his perceptions but not in terms of what the patient needs it is never doing what we feel comfortable with , as i learned in my internship we have a clear understanding of anxiety and panic see my piece in the world congress of psychiatry http www activitas org index php nervosa article view , as well as what causes paranoia and what to do about it we don t have to guess about what generates depression because we have a theory to guide us and decades of experience to tell us what works and why so in those many approaches that they claim to be valid there may be ten different explanations of paranoia , not one , most of which do not concord with brain science will it help to talk her out of her paranoia ? not quite since it is not an attitude it is an imprint with a history and a biochemical foundation , not just a cognitive misstep without a comprehension of the levels of consciousness i cannot imagine how to construct a valid psychotherapy because in the brain and its evolution there are distinct levels of consciousness with different identities and different symptoms for example , colitis has a specific origin and gets its start very early in evolution that symptom can tell us where in the brain it is located and originates , and what we can do to treat it when a patient needs drugs we know what to use in conjunction with medical advice we know that serious mental symptoms require deep brain blockers because we understand that bizarre symptoms require deep access we also know that any scientific therapy must ultimately access deep brain engraved memories we know that in gestation there are already imprints and repression that may be compounded into terrible depression later on we do not have to concoct hypotheses stemming from freudian days about anger turned inward we learn from the unconscious of each patient , and from there , build a theory that helps explain it we simply observe and listen it is all there , just waiting to be discovered it is not us that holds the truth it is always the patient so how can ten different therapies all be valid ? it can be affirmed precisely because there is no science that they follow therefore anything can work if a neurosis is built on sequestered pain , how could we do anything else but access and address that pain ? we may disagree as to what to do about it but not of the pain itself , which we have seen thousands of times over forty seven years of primal and of course we would not rely on medication as treatment when we do not want to push down the pain anymore , but rather to let it out to express it at last yes , if we do not admit to the stored pain and imprints then anything goes further , when we do acknowledge the existence of pain , we need to understand that we cannot travel deep too soon we know now that there is a valence to each pain only so much that can be experienced at any time to deny that and over reach the boundaries endangers the patient and her mental stability yes there are times when the pain is hurtful but we understand that each little bit experienced is so much less pain driving us and that is why we see so much less stress hormones in our patients as if to underline that feeling pain relieves our neurotic burden so to me , there cannot be any number of therapies all valid there can be many therapies all invalid , but they can claim validity if they change the criteria for improvement if they rely only on psychologic criteria , i feel much better but no matter what she says , the biologic measurements tell another story so yes we can claim validity when we leave biology out of the equation but it is a pseudo state , and we don t want to get pseudo well , do we ?
