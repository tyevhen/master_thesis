where is reality ? it is certain that the serotonin endorphin system will not turn out to be the sole mechanism by which hypnotic dissociation occurs there is a key central brain inhibitor known as glutamate but we do know that hypnotic suggestion can catalyze inhibitory or repressive chemical production the suggestion or idea given by the hypnotist is transformed into electrochemical activity that somehow blocks pain more specifically , the suggestion takes on a meaning on the third or cognitive level of consciousness and is then transformed into electrochemical processes which inhibit perception of physical experience think of it ! a bit of air in the form of certain sounds words breathed out to another produces biochemical changes in her which alter her perceptions and block pain the subject in hilgard 's ice water experiment was no longer responding to the reality of the ice water instead , she was responding to ideas about it , even when those ideas were in complete contradiction to events actually taking place this transformation of meaning that occurs in hypnosis is not unlike the transformation of meaning that makes neurosis possible in both , the perception or meaning of the event is altered on one level of consciousness while its intrinsic meaning is registered accurately on the other levels this leads to the sixty four dollar question where is reality ? if i say to a hypnotic subject , i'm going to put a hot piece of metal on the back of your hand , and then put a cold quarter on it , and the hand then blisters as if a hot metal were placed there an effect that has been demonstrated in hypnosis , what is real ? the metal , the response , the idea , the suggestion ? is there no objective reality ? objective reality dictates that the psychophysiology responds to a cold quarter yet the idea in the mind is that it is a hot one and the physiology follows that idea clearly , reality is in the perception that is , intellectual reality that reality dictates bodily reactions this is the true meaning of psychosomatic here the mind innervates and alters bodily reactions so if we wonder how it is that a child who obeys his parents absolutely has allergies or asthma we see it encapsulated in the hypnosis experiments the parental dictates change the immune system of the child , for example if i perceive an elevator to be terrifying , even though it clearly is n't , and i'm dizzy , fainting , etc , in plain terror , it is my perception that is real for me but that perception is based on a history the newly perceived reality has an historical basis there are levels of reality that lay on different levels of consciousness the hypnotist who pricks you states that you will not hurt , and there is no perception of hurt yet the blood pressure and heart rate mount the lower level knows reality on its level that is why when you are in touch with the lower levels of consciousness you are not so easily fooled , lulled or hypnotized the physiological processes inform the cortex of what is reality what hitler did in germany was an effective job of hypnosis he suggested with emotional force , you are superior to all other races ! you need liebensraum ! more space and freedom for those who felt inferior and downtrodden , it was a perfect message and hitler got the german people to do almost anything , including killing millions of inferior individuals even those who realistically did not need any more living space responded to his message what was inserted into their minds supplanted reality and they acted exactly as if they had been hypnotized they could kill without feeling anything because any appreciation of the meaning of their acts had been wiped away meanwhile , those who wanted and needed peace , an obvious choice , were known as defeatists and were punished hitler 's control became absolute the mesmerized dissociated populace went on fighting and dying for a dying cause that had nothing to do with their everyday lives not so different today in iraq where any talk of a peaceful solution is considered by the administration as defeatest and sending the wrong message to our troops jingoism then becomes the only topic admissible how did hitler do it ? he tapped into the people 's basic needs and into their split consciousness he capitalized on their already existing dissociation and on the ideas that duty was all , and that how you felt was unimportant he used their feeling of being a defeated nation to suggest that they were conquerors he turned reality upside down in short , he suppressed their pain just as a hypnotist does , and he infused and inculcated another reality his hitler was so skilled and his subjects so prepared that he could do it on a mass level this whole notion of the nature of reality is critical to an understanding of psychotherapy , for if we assume that reality is what the patient tells us it us i feel wonderful therapy has been a great success we will be led astray we have neglected an important internal reality , something that can only be achieved by talking to the body that is , measuring it to see what secrets it holds it may tell a very different story so then were is reality ? is it what the patients says it is in short , the nature of reality splits the field of psychotherapy into those who think it is cognitive and those who think it is cognitive somatic when there is dissociation , either in neurosis or hypnosis , the information takes a detour and the person is unconscious of certain facts or states one of the structures to help in this detour is the thalamus
