years ago , three children disappeared into the woods near the small town of knocknaree only one was found he was covered in blood and remembered nothing of what happened years later , that little boy is a grown man and is a detective with the dublin murder squad when a new child murder case pops up in knocknaree , detective ryan struggles to remember what happened to him all those years ago this book is really hard for me to review because in some ways it was very , very satisfying , and in some ways it was dissatisfying but the dissatisfying aspects were where realism meets mystery police procedural i guess the element of realism , and the fantastic writing , are why people consider this a piece of literary fiction whatever that means i can say that some of the twists were predictable to me , but i was still very interested in how the story was going to turn out i ca n't say more without spoilers , so i 'll leave it at that
