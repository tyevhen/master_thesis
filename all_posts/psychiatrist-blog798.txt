kevinmd has a post up today by tobin arthur called online reputation can have career implications for physicians arthur also refers to a post on the ama 's website back in october by amy lynn sorrel , negative online reviews leave doctors with little recourse good timing because i wanted to post a vignette about a friend who is distraught about the on line reviews he 's gotten from patients to protect both the innocent and the guilty , i'm confabulating the details demographics , but the gist of the story is real and i 'd like to hear your comments dr tom shrinky not his real name is a friend of mine who practices in sanetown , pa not a real place he 's an excellent psychiatrist with a great reputation , a packed practice with a long wait for new patient entry , and he 's as conscientious as they come he carries his cell phone everywhere and he returns all calls within the day plus , he 's a nice guy , though i may be biased because we 're friends one day , a patient says to dr shrinky , doc , you know , i googled you , and it was n't pretty alarmed , tom goes to google himself and discovers that he 's got a patient review up on one of these rate your doc sites the comments are strangely personal , they comment on his recent weight loss , and say that he 's in bed with the drug companies there are a couple of other reviews , all star , all saying how he 's the best shrink in the world , but his overall rating is star , and you 'd wonder if he was n't dying from the comment okay , you hate a restaurant , you zing it on yelp and you do n't go back but tom believes he knows who put these comments up he has a patient , a lawyer he sees for weekly psychotherapy sessions the patient is often hostile towards him , often treats him in a demeaning fashion , and this relationship does not feel good the patient left treatment once briefly , years ago , but returned because , you shrinks are all nuts and you 're better than dr cashew why tom took him back , i 'll never know tom tries to get the patient to focus on his hostility as part of the treatment so , a drug rep did stop by the office once to drop off samples while the patient was in the waiting room , and the patient had made a comment about this and tom had lost a lot of weight recently he 'd taken up running and before he knew it , he was doing half marathons he cut back on carbs , beer and soda , and pounds had dropped off him over months he looked great , and everyone commented including his patients this particular patient , however , had said nothing , and one day walked in , looked tom up and down , and said , have you got cancer or aids ? so the comment on the review about how he 'd lost a lot of weight recently and looked like he had cancer tom could think of no one else who was unhappy with him or who would do this unlike the restaurant patron , tom 's patient continues to show up weekly for psychotherapy tom feels a bit intimidated by him this is not new and is always happy when he cancels so far , tom has n't asked if he wrote the review , but it bothers him others have put up counter reviews , but there is a second bad review , and tom thinks this is also the same patient a colleague mentioned that a patient he tried to refer would not see him because of the reviews so , my thoughts , and then please do add yours it seems to me that sometimes people have negative feelings in the course of a psychotherapy ah , we might call this transference , but it would be dismissive to attribute all negative feedback to negative transference in this case , it 's no longer a doctor patient issue , but one that has potentially included the entire world via the internet should tom ask his patient if he 's put up the reviews ? what does that get him ? the patient may become embarrassed or defensive , or he may say he did n't do it and maybe he did n't ? and be angry at the accusation how does a psychiatrist or any doctor continue to treat someone who publicly struck at their reputation ? and here 's another problem for the doc a patient who would do this might also go to the physician licensing board and complain , and so tom may worry that to terminate this patient 's care may incite the patient 's anger and result in a complaint and investigation of his practice the patient is a credible professional and a complaint from him would likely be taken quite seriously while tom is certain he 's provided responsible care and has not violated any standards of practice , he 's well aware that a board investigation if a complaint did progress to that takes years and causes a great deal of expense and agony , and so he may well be worried about fanning any flames and finally , tom is worried about upsetting the patient he 's been taking care of this patient for years , and he does n't want this to end badly so what should dr tom shrinky do ?
