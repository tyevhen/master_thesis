do you feel that we are winning the war on drugs , or do you feel our current policy is doing more harm than good ? if alcohol and tobacco are distributed under a controlled system , should other drugs be available in the same way ? i am not an advocate for complete legalization of all drugs , but i don t think the current no tolerance policies are working , especially if we allow alcohol and tobacco to be available , as that sends a mixed message what do you guys think ? don t get me wrong , i am not advocating the legalization of all drugs , i am just curious as to what other people think about the state of drug control in our country , which is clearly not working answer i think they should legalize all drugs just like they legalized alcohol like you said , people die from alcohol poisoning , people die or kill others from drinking and driving just because it s legal doesn t mean it s safe just because it s illegal for those underage , doesn t mean they won t get it i think of it this way , if people want alcohol , if people want drugs , they ll get them , weather it s legal or not it would be much safer to be able to buy some ecstasy from a corner store than some shady drug dealer and from personal experience , i ve felt much worse after drinking to much than after taking ecstasy one time i got so sick from drinking my wife looked up poison control and was ready to call them if i completely passed out , it was a terrible feeling i ve never been that ill from taking e that said , how much you take of any drug or alcohol affects how much it affects you but as you know , alcohol is legal for me , so if i want to eff myself up or kill myself by alcohol poisoning , i can ! legally ! what kind of sense does that make ? they say drink responsibly , well , why can t we do other drugs responsibly ? we can there will always be people who aren t responsible with drugs or alcohol there will always be alcoholics , and there will always be people who just don t like drinking and never drink i think the same would be true for drugs , there will always be your addicts , and there will always be your people who just don t want to do it , and there will be people who will just do a little on occasion i say if someone wants to screw up their lives to doing drugs to much , let them , it s their life right ? i mean people can already do that with alcohol if they wanted to ! whats the difference to do it with something else ? none , they both can ruin your life or they can both bring you relaxation after a stressful week so yeah i agree , its screwed up that alcohol is legal once your , and you can easily ruin your life or kill yourself and others from drinking to much , but other things are completely illegal i think it makes no sense i think they should just legalize other drugs and regulate them just like they regulate alcohol , have an age limit and all that i really don t understand that whole war on drugs thing i remember seeing something on tv about it a while back and they said it started years and years ago , but they haven t made any progress so they think its a way to just keep putting funding into something , i think is what they said this subject kindof upsets me , lol i hate to think that for having a little e , like if i had a single pill or two just for myself , i could get in trouble for it , probably arrested but i can buy enough alcohol to kill myself times , and that s ok because i m over question what do you think of the legal status of alcohol and tobacco ?

answer lmfao at the person who said zero tolerance on all drugs but then proceeded to say alcohol and tobacco are fine those are drugs , dumb edit wow if you think tobacco and alcohol i realize tobacco is debatable for those smokers who believe smoking doesnt effect their brain , but certainly alcohol are less intoxicating and dangerous than marijuana , you have fallen off your rocker i think are drug policies are backwards many of the drugs that should be illegal are legal , and at least a few of the illegal ones should be legal and are no where near as bad as the dea has made them sound marijuana is an example as far as mdma , the problem is that all mdma available is street cooked , which means you have absolutely no idea whats in it with no legal pharmaceutical mdma , its use is dangerous now , if real mdma was accessible , then that would b a different story in my opinion i believe that marijuana should be legal and regulated the way alcohol and tobacco are question what do you think of the legal status of alcohol and tobacco ?
