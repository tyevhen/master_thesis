if you have the blahs or the blues or the vague icky not good feelings that have sapped your energy and your zest for life , do n't stay in bed get up and make your bed and get dressed do some exercise even a walk around the block or with your arms straight down at your sides , wiggle your hands from side to side and shake your arms good and hard to the count of keep some nonsense rhyme kind of going on whenever you can remember to do it or sing some dumb little song in your mind because this will keep the gray clouds from completely engulfing you if you 're alone , you can sing the song right out loud go ahead do it if you 're alone , you can laugh out loud oh , you wo n't want to do it your brain will absolutely balk but you can do it anyway laugh at least ten times out loud not because anything is funny but just because this is the thing that depression hates you to do the most do n't do what your downer thoughts want you to do do something that will shake you up and get you going toward something productive do one small chore like the dishes , or put away some clothes look around and put something back in its place then put something else away move ahead into your day if you do n't have anything planned , now is the time to plan something go to your public library and check out a biography of some great man or woman take it to some small cafe and treat yourself to some breakfast the world is all around you you are a part of all you see you are not alone a b curtiss
