dr robert young recently noted the following information on his newsletter a study by agricultural research service ars funded scientists suggests alkaline plant foods may help preserve muscle mass and bone density in older men and women the american diet is highly acidic in protein , cereal grains and other acid producing foods in general , such acidic diets generate dietary amounts of acid each day with aging , a mild but slowly increasing metabolic acidosis develops acidosis appears to trigger a muscle wasting response so the researchers looked at links between measures of lean body mass and diets relatively high in alkaline potassium rich , alkaline residue producing fruits and vegetables such diets could help neutralize acidosis foods can be considered alkaline or acidic based on the residues they produce in the body , rather than whether they are alkaline or acidic themselves for example , acidic grapefruits , lemons and limes are metabolized to alkaline residues because of their high alkaline potassium bicarbonate content to find out more about the alkaline diet visit http www phmiracleliving com t approach aspx
