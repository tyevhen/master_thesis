hi friends ! i first want to thank you all for your wonderful birthday wishes and sweet words ! i was so touched by your lovely comments ! ! thanks so much , it truly made me feel so special and that chris so sweet to break in to my blog and write all that ! he 's a wonder ! also , thanks so much for your lovely response to my previous post about my post partem issues i'm feeling pretty good and am working toward recovery my insomnia is pretty much gone and my anxiety nervousness is gone for the most part i feel so much more like myself again ! for now i'm in an onward and upward mode in more good news , paige slept through from pm ish to am the past nights ! i hope it continues ! she 'd been down to one night waking at around on average to eat and then sleeping until or so then , nights ago she went all the way to and i about crapped myself out of surprise and out of fear that something was wrong but alas , all was well and she was fine and no , i did n't end up crapping myself after all i put her back to bed after this am feeding and she 's gone another hours or so my fingers are crossed for continued sleepful bliss on both our parts in other news paige has started babbling quite a bit a joy ! ! ! ! and she 's even starting to grab with her hands instead of just flailing them around aimlessly all the time i like having conversations with her now and she 's practicing so hard to say la la la she 's having fun discovering her tongue so , that 's the news with her ! i have a confession before paige was born i bought on a whim a baby einstein dvd one for age months and up i dug it out a little while ago and plopped it in the dvd player on a lark just to see if she 'd be interested in it well , she ended up staring at the screen for the entire duration of the dvd from her little bouncy chair oh crap she loved it and has seen it a few times since not every day but here and there and she continues to love it the problem is that nobody else i know has the tv on in the house with the baby during the day i have it on all day long as background noise and for myself to view while i feed her i 'll admit it here , since i like to be candid i feel like maybe i should have it turned off as well that i'm being some sort of bad mom for having it on and corrupting her little mind i know she likes the sounds and the colors and lights of it and i certainly do n't want her to become a couch potato i do n't want to allow her to one day sit in front of the tv all day when there is a world to explore outside but for now i figure what 's the harm ? some people feel like it 's no big deal while others feel like it 's a horrible thing it was on the other night while chris and i were eating dinner in the living room and paige was in her bouncy chair she turned her head to see the screen and we were watching a rerun of bones of course , there was a freaky human carcass of bones and wilted flesh on the screen being dissected by the scientists on the fictional show and paige was fascinated and staring then i realized i'm allowing my baby daughter to see this ! what the fuck is wrong with me ? ? ? she did n't seem to mind as she had no idea what she was watching but i turned her chair away anyway since i was ashamed of myself next thing you know waaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh ! ! ! ! ! ! ! sheepishly , i turned her back 'round to watch the dissection , and i swear , a little smile curled on her mouth so i told myself hey , maybe she just wants to be a forensic scientist one day and is getting a head start with her research ? ! ! and i went back to what i was doing needless to say , the tv has been off all afternoon today and i 've learned my lesson but , i think baby einstein will be here to stay who can say no to a bunch of puppets and funky looking toys all played to the music of bach ? sure , i 'll want to gouge my eyes out with an ice pick but what 's a little sacrifice for a happy baby ? save you might also like before and now mother 's day and the birth the worrier linkwithin
