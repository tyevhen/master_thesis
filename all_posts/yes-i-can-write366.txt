as you may have noticed , the poll on the sidebar has now ended ! the question was 'what would you consider your political leanings ? ' actually , it was 'would would you consider your political leanings ? ' , but i'm pretty sure people got what i meant here are the results , after votes ! leftist rightist anarchist libertarian something totally different why am i not surprised that no one on the right end of the political spectrum reads my blog ? i now have a new poll up , which is on the sidebar , same as before in rather exciting to me news , i happened to stumble across the rethinking education unschooling conference , and i absolutely freaked out it looks amazing ! all unschooling conferences have a bit of a hippie vibe , but this conference takes the hippie radical ness even further the keynote speaker is daniel quinn , one of the best known anti civilizationists out there , and author of ishmael there are tons of workshops and talks to go to , on such wonderfully interesting subjects as raising your kids using hunter gatherer parenting knowledge , natural healing and taking care of yourself and family , entrepreneurship and not working for other people , radical honesty the list of stuff i 'd love to go to is very very long ! plus , it seems very much geared towards teens and young adults , something i 've yet to see in any of the conferences i 've looked into ! only problem ? the rethinking education conference is in texas yeah , it 's a bit far away but i 'd still love to go so we 're going to see if we can maybe , just possibly , swing it so , i now need to go clean because my friend from boston is coming tomorrow , and the house is a mess and my mom has been threatening to tell him he ca n't come which would be horribly mean so i am off to clean ! oh , what fun peace , idzie you might also like talks and magazines going to the uwwg ! unschooling gatherings nbtsc linkwithin
