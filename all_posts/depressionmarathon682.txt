i do n't get it yesterday i could barely move again it was n't the soreness from the marathon it was depression rearing its ugly , nasty , punitive head again i was in tears from the time i woke up until just minutes before i approached my first patient hours later i was totally overwhelmed i did n't think i could do anything , and yet there i was with a whole day of patients waiting for me later in the day , i was curled up on my sofa paralyzed i could n't move , and i could n't believe it it did n't make any sense i could n't understand how i could have run miles just two days before i could n't understand how i could have done that , and yet there i was in tears , paralyzed on my sofa was i just being lazy ? was i a total loser , unable to face real life ? that 's certainly how i felt i also felt guilty i felt ashamed i felt demoralized i felt afraid i could n't understand how the darkness had so quickly cloaked me in lead again i do n't understand today is not starting any better i'm low i'm low again i'm overwhelmed i'm afraid of returning to work and being unable to handle it i'm afraid of losing my job if i ca n't work i feel like i need to take some time off , to get well , but i ca n't afford to do that either literally with no benefits , who will pay my bills if i'm not at work ? nobody i'm on my own i want the overwhelming , scary , debilitating darkness to go away i want it to go away now i do n't know how much more i can endure i'm afraid of the darkness now i'm afraid i ca n't handle it anymore i do n't know how much fight i have left and none of this makes any sense i hate this illness hate it
