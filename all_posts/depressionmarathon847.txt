it was a strange day in my little corner of the world things started great after puck awoke at he is a creature of habit i went back to bed and got an extra hour of sleep i saw my psychiatrist and told her how well i was doing i swam yards without much difficulty i discussed remodeling my basement with a contractor and then crash i 've had a hard time lifting my head off the pillow , more figuratively than literally , the rest of the day all of a sudden i lost all of my oomph shortly thereafter , i noticed my thinking was a little off , and then the sadness set in weird it was another precipitous dive into gray i'm feeling okay now , just okay , but i'm a little leery i do n't know where that little dip came from i do n't know if it 's done if it 's done for now , is it coming back ? like i said , it was weird it 's still weird i'm not sure what else i can even say about it but now that i'm feeling okay , i think i 'll try to cross some of the other items off of my to do list and i 'll leave you with this thought by aristotle we are what we repeatedly do excellence , then is not an act , but a habit
