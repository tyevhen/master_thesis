this idea has been taking shape in my mind anyway for quite awhile it started when nate 's ot began coming out of their sessions and telling me about a new word here or there that he would say after some of the sensory activities they do in their work particularly swinging i have wanted an ot swing forever for the boys they both find it very calming , but the back and forth kind that are outside are not adequate for what i am talking about although as we can all attest , they are pretty calming too here is a good explanation http www takeaswing com bos html great , i want one here is the one i have been wanting https kidsdreamgym com products page autism swing hammocks joki hanging crows nest ok , close to with shipping not horrible , but let 's face it , i do n't have that kind of money to be spending on a swing , and with the mats that would be needed under the swing , the hanging mechanism , etc , it would be much more so i was sitting in the boys' ot waiting room yesterday talking to a dad , and he told me about this from ikea , for bucks here is the description swinging develops the sense of balance and body perception it also brings a feeling of well being and relaxation how awesome is this ? oh wait , so awesome that it 's been discontinued crappity crap so this mama did what she does whenever she has a problem of this nature i consulted craigslist well low and behold , there was one listed in virginia ! for ! it was an hour and a half drive each way , but frankly i was up for it considering the circumstances so i emailed the seller and after telling her about the boys and where we live , she offered to ship it to us ! and since she is another autism mom , i do n't doubt her at all this is great news for the boys one more thing though where to put it we do n't have a large area in our home that we can dedicate to something like this i do n't trust the boys to have something like this in their room and not try to yank it from the ceiling call me crazy , ha so hanging this swing will involve daddy taking one for the team daddy has a man cave in our garage , and well , for him to have this cave i have already sacrificed my garage parking spot , so i guess we are both giving here today i casually suggested setting up a sensory ot area in the front half of my side , while his area would still be in the back half and he said ok ! now it will involve some clean out of other kiddie items , etc , but i think this will be great ! no worries about locating a beam to hang the swing from since the rafters are already exposed we have a trampoline , and a tunnel , so really we just need to get some mats to lay out on the floor , and then go from there i have lots of cheapy ideas and i think i can make this into a great , calming area for both boys i am totally psyched ! and just another little shout out to ikea and their sensory friendly kids' items look at this stuff now i think that the rings and flat swing are also discontinued think ebay , but the egg chair is not the thing spins , and the canopy pulls all the way down in front to make a little cave for the child to be in the dad at ot said they are probably getting rid of theirs and will give it to us i just ca n't believe that a swedish furniture company could have such insight ! or is it that the rest of the world is already in on the secret that there are many kids with major sensory needs ? either way , i am excited to get started on this next little project
