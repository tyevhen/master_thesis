i ran into this piece on new statesman by helen lewis that links to footage of forensic psychiatrist , park dietz , describing best practices for how news media should not cover a mass murder if you do n't want to propagate more mass murders do n't start the story with sirens blaring do n't have photographs of the killer do n't make this coverage do everything you can not to make the body count the lead story not to make the killer some kind of anti hero do localise this story to the affected community and as boring as possible in every other market
