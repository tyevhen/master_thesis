it s been one full year since i started this blog ! on november th i m pretty proud of myself , i m not gonna lie if you didn t know , i started this blogyish thing last year because i was wigging out about the upcoming holidays for many reasons , the holiday season can exaggerate the symptoms of those who struggle with mental illness and make normal people do crazy stuff looking back on those inaugural posts , i am surprised by my sarcasm i felt so insecure about publishing my writing on the internet who am i that other people would read me stuff ? i still feel that way , but i am less sarcastic because i have so much i want to say this whole year , i ve just wanted to scream on the rooftops that mental illness is real and it hurts but it s beatable you don t have to settle for a mediocre life you can have a nourishing life i ve tried to bring you with me on this journey and that s why my posts are as different as my changing moods i ve tried to make you cry with me , laugh with me , rejoice , or rally with me i think , on the whole , i ve really just wanted to empower you by giving you information i believe knowledge is not only powerful , but self awareness is sanctifying anniversaries are a good time to take a step back and assess how far we ve come , what has changed , and how we ve grown even though some days i feel like i m at square one , i can still look back and acknowledge all the progress i ve made below are five so difficult to choose ! of my favorite posts from this year the post that started it all ! ! ! the post that i published when i stopped counting and decided to be in it for the long hull milestone , not to be confused with coldstone yum for all you lord of the rings fans out there oh wait that just me the smeagol post and , to end on a humorous note , the funny thing and the forum whatever post i hope you have a nourishing week see you again soon !
