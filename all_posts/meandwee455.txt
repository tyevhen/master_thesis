dear little p , hi sweetie ! well , as you can see , this is my first letter to you as you are now here in the world with us instead of in my tummy what a grand month it has been ! this first month of your life has been an amazing roller coaster of emotions for your daddy and for me and we are thrilled that we have learned so much and you 're learning every day too ! you 've met a lot of your family and many of our friends you seem to fit right into things ! but it 's hard not to like you being so friendly , sweet and kind and all it does n't hurt that you are cute too of course , your birth was amazing , but the following few weeks have been such a whirlwind of getting to know you better we 've been working hard to learn how you like to be soothed , how you like to be held , how you like to lay to sleep , what songs you like sung to you and other important details to your current livelihood we 've also spent a good amount of time cleaning up your spit up , vomit , poop , pee , and who knows what i guess you have n't lived until you 've been pooped on , peed on , puked on , and gagged on all in one day it 's ok because it 's all part of you i am happy all your functions are in order ! as of the other day , you 've started to look at me while i hold you it 's so precious to be able to stare into those big eyes of yours as you check me out you like to stare at my hair a lot probably because it is frizzy and crazy most of the time having hair like a fraggle is proving to be entertaining in the wee hours you seem to love the wee hours ! midnight to around am is a time you seem to be wiggly and scream y i know that is a time i will not be sleeping and must try to soothe you until it is time for your next feeding i'm learning to not get upset about this and to look at it as a chance to spend some quality time with you when you finally relax after doing the or s es such a swaddling , shooshing , swaying , etc i love to trace the soft outlines of your face with my eyes to drink in every rounded curve of your cheeks and eyelashes i want to memorize your face as it is now and keep it with me as a treasure the moment will disappear into ashes , but my memory can hold you longer i love you more and more with each and every moment and miss you more and more as each passes it 's a tidal push and pull of love i 've never known before i'm excited about your second month of life as it 's going to get even better i'm excited about what time will bring us ! i hope you like it here please know that your daddy and i love you more than anything and do n't know how we got so lucky that out of all the little girls that god has created we got the best one ! thank you for choosing us to be your family save
