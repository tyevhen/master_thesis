i had to get out of town depression has been kicking my ass ! from anger to tears , hopelessness to frustration , and finally to complete and utter despair , i have n't been able to escape my mood is so low my thoughts so dark i did n't want to go back into the hospital , and that seemed to be everybody 's number one suggestion , so instead i packed up and left i traveled north to my home area , the north shore of lake superior last night jet and i camped in a state park where we roasted hot dogs with my parents and hiked the trails my back hurts , and jet 's exhausted , but it was worth it nonetheless i 'll be spending another couple of days up here soaking in everything i love about this place as well as visiting family and old friends i'm hoping for a geographical cure so far the change in scenery , while not perfect , has provided some relief unfortunately , the problem with a geographical cure is wherever i go , there i am so there is still hopelessness , and darkness , and despair the unwelcome thoughts continue creeping around the edges despite my efforts but some relief is better than no relief today i'm at least able to breathe i'm thankful for that depression has been kicking my ass right now i'm doing my best to kick back
