what a strange day i slept in , taking advantage of my one rest day in the past couple weeks , but once up i continued to feel tired and sluggish at the same time , i was totally , physically anxious ! my heart was racing i was a bit nauseous i felt worried , scared , jittery strange things finally got so out of control , i resorted to an anti anxiety med i very rarely need to take it was awful of course the anxiety med made me sleepy , so i ended up back in bed my day did n't really start until mid afternoon after a walk with my boy , i finally got to work laundry , bills , dishes the usual routine i felt a little better , but still off i'm still a little off now perhaps i'm anxious about this friday night i volunteered to speak about gratitude in action at a large aa gathering it 's a minute gig , but i am nervous for starters , i just began seriously thinking about what to say today and i do n't know what to say ! yikes ! it 's not like telling my story , which of course i know by heart ! this is more like a class assignment i 've got to figure out what to say before pm friday , and then i 've got to say it ! yikes , again ! think positive thoughts for me , okay ? i 'll leave you with this positive thought i found it during my research today develop an attitude of gratitude , and give thanks for everything that happens to you , knowing that every step forward is a step toward achieving something bigger and better than your current situation brian tracy
