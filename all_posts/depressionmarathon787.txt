wow , the busy , busy , business continues i sold my car and tonight i drove home in my new one ! yippee ! it was strange going from a little sports coupe to an suv i felt like i was driving a bus ! my motorcycle is still for sale , but i 've had lots of interest my basement renovation is nearing completion i now have walls ! soon , it will be up to me to paint , and then the guys will come back to trim it out it 's been years since the flood that caused the loss of the rooms down there now , it will finally be better than it was originally i'm also preparing for my garage sale , which i decided will be next friday and saturday preparing will be a lot of work , but it will be soooo worth it to lighten up my home i 've got too much stuff ! by the way , i weighed myself today i 've lost pounds already ! and that 's without exercise ! this weight watchers program really works it 's made me very mindful of what i'm putting in my mouth i'm making better choices but the primary result is that i'm choosing not to eat for reasons other than hunger huh , go figure ! i eat now when i'm hungry , and i do n't eat when i'm not i'm pretty excited about the weight loss i do n't look any different , but my clothes fit better so life is good i'm putting one foot in front of the other , and that seems to be working for now
