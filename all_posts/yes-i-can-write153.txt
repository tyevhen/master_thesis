warning this is a grumpy rant if you 're not in the mood for negativity , or think you might be offended by some good ol' fashioned grumpy ranting , then you might want to skip this post normally , the negativity people express about unschooling does n't really bother me that much i 'll get slightly annoyed , yes , upon reading or hearing stupid comments or ignorant misconceptions , but i 'll calmly share my personal positive experiences , or send them a link that i think might help them understand unschooling if they wish to do so , then move on if i was n't able to easily move past annoyances with people 's perceptions of unschooling , then i do n't think i 'd be able to be as public about unschooling as i am ! but lately , in the last week or so , it has n't been so easy in short , i 've been kind of crabby but especially crabby when it comes to unschooling ! i read someone saying that child led learning is fabulous but child led learning , in my opinion , does not prepare them for most modern day jobs and i scream internally you have no experience with unschooling , have never even met an unschooler , so you can't say that ! your statement is based in ignorance please be less ignorant before making statements and that 's just my reaction when the statement is made in complete ignorance my anger jumps considerably when i stumble across a homeschooling mother who states as the director of a large local homeschool co op , i 've had the opportunity to see first hand the differences between 'unschooled' homeschoolers and 'schooled' homeschoolers there is a vast difference in their ability to keep up and move forward the 'unschoolers' also struggle with understanding time restraints because they are allowed to 'learn' at whatever they happen to be doing , they struggle to succeed in an environment that is controlled and has direction do n't you love the fact she adds quotes on learn when speaking of unschoolers ? apparently her bossy personality is very annoyed when these unschooled kids are reluctant to drop whatever project they 're working on and engaged in , to move onto something else they 're not currently interested in struggling with understanding time restraints apparently these unschooled kids learn at their own pace , and refuse to follow this seemingly very narrow minded woman 's view of where they should be in relation to other kids their ability to keep up and move forward , and apparently this does not make her very happy if i ca n't help getting annoyed at those who make judgments about unschooling in ignorance , at least i get it i understand that unschooling is something vastly different from most people 's experience , and something that 's difficult for many people to understand so while i might be annoyed momentarily , i do n't hold it against the individual at all but when a homeschooler thinks it 's their duty to explain disapprovingly and condescendingly how bad unschooling is , how incompetent the parents are , how we 're totally doin' it wrong and are giving a bad name to the real homeschoolers , now that to me is simply unacceptable and i have come across this type of attitude among homeschoolers a lot we 're supposed to be on the same side , dammit ! i 'd never put down homeschoolers in a public forum like that we 're all misunderstood by the general populace all targeted by restrictive laws and disapproving people we should be banding together , not attacking each other or getting into petty disputes over who is doing a better job really and truly so that 's how i 've been feeling lately fed up with dealing with the vast amount of ignorance and disapproval around unschooling , fed up with though in no way planning to stop explaining unschooling , time and time again , to people who just do n't get it i'm not truly angry at the people who do n't get it , though i'm just angered by a culture and system of schooling that 's created a situation where something as simple and beautiful as life learning is incomprehensible to most people and i'm saddened by how many people react in harsh judgment and condemnation to something they simply do n't understand this mood will pass in a few days , maybe a couple of weeks , i'm sure i 'll go back to being able to brush the negativity off with an easy smile and a patient response but right now ? right now it just pisses me off you might also like blame unschooling ! favorite unschooling posts on this blog of the cons of unschooling misconceptions about unschooling linkwithin
