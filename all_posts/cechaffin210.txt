i have not blogged in some time for two reasons i have not felt the need to blog since my depression went into remission remember , i started the blog in mexico as a way of enduring my trials , having white space in which to order my thoughts about my experience later , it became a therapeutic aid to enduring depression , to such a an extent that kathleen and close friends questioned whether it was actually extending my depression by reinforcement that , happily , was not true in writing about my chemical distress i was able to objectify my diseased feelings during the act of writing and thus obtain some temporary relief by means of my blog the comments were helpful , too the contact the affirmation it was a discipline i practiced in order to hang onto some sort of stated reality , which you suffered with me when i wrote well i have run into discouraging technical problems and do n't know how to fix them when i post at my blog now , any change at the posting itself results in a translation into an unknown language whose script reminds me of cambodian , though it is not cambodian how such a glitch developed is beyond me it has never been about numbers , but since i stopped blogging , visitors have dropped only because of the long tail of references i left behind in former posts , so that searchers looking for a quote from churchill or details on freud 's vasectomy unwittingly enter my blog space only two close friends questioned why i was n't blogging i told them i no longer felt the need i have contemplated a new blog to rid myself of the present glitches in this one , a blog dedicated to joy as in my last post , a place of hope where there was darkness if you want to see such a blog , please comment meanwhile i have been gardening , performing music , writing poetry , volunteering as a docent at the botanical gardens , leading music therapy at a ministry for the homeless and mentally ill , attending men 's groups and debating poetry at various forums , where i defend eliot again among other things i 've also been nursing kathleen , who has suffered a gum infection from a botched root canal that also plunged her into a depression she is a unipolar , i'm a bipolar that does n't mean her depression does n't scare me , but i keep whistling through the graveyard of life i'm confident enough to support her , as she did me for two years as for bloviating online , here are links to recent discussions in which i play a primary role lost in the shallows , a discussion of contemporary verse defending eliot at babilu forum critique thread at alsop 's gazebo recent publications , including youtube posted before http web mac com tomkoontz site chaffin html http www fieralingue it modules php ? name content pa list pages categories cid http www umbrellajournal com spring how divine c e chaffin html http www youtube com watch ? v ozymixtdcfs http www angelfire com zine bluefifth winter poemsw html all for now , i fear the quasi cambodian interpreting ghost at my typing fingers' heels two kilobunnies , ce
