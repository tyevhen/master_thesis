i'm in the process of readjusting some of my goals depression is not letting up i'm struggling and for the first time in a long time , running is nearly impossible i 've had plenty of depression episodes over the past ten years , but one saving grace of each episode has been that i 've not lost the will or desire to run running has been difficult at times , but it 's never left me running right now has left me it 's not only difficult it 's not fun i just do n't have the will , desire or energy to go i have also lost the will , desire , and energy to swim , bike , lift weights , or do just about anything physical since my marathon training plan calls for all of the above swimming , lifting , biking , and running i'm in the process of readjusting some of my expectations my marathon training plan has basically been scrapped i'm trying right now to be okay with that instead of rigidly following my typical training plan , i 've taken the suggestion to get out and move my body at least once daily i have an empty calendar sitting on my kitchen table my goal is to fill that calendar with at least a walk every single day it 's working i 've gone out walking for two days , and i was actually able to run a mile today such a small step , but it was an enormous accomplishment i have to have faith that small steps will lead to bigger and bigger accomplishments i just need to keep at it i do n't have a clue if i 'll be able to prepare for boston or not , but today i ran a mile considering how awful i feel , that is a pretty big deal i 'll take it
