one evening , over dinner , her boyfriend , ted , told her that he wanted to breakup he accepted a job out of state , and he did n't want to have a long distance relationship , so he thought it was better to end their relationship at first , betty panicked even though she was dissatisfied with the relationship , at least she had someone to have dinner with and to go to the theatre now , she would have no one during the first few months after the breakup , betty mourned the end of her relationship how a crisis can bring about positive change in your life shortly after that , a close friend introduced her to someone new , john after dating for a few months , betty and her new boyfriend decided to be exclusive , and she realized that she was happier in this relationship than she had ever been had she and ted remained together , she would never started dating john what initially felt like a major crisis in her life turned out to be a positive change donna donna had always enjoyed good health for most of her life but shortly after her th birthday , she had a mild heart attack and was hospitalized after she was discharged , her cardiologist spoke to her about her stressful lifestyle , including a stressful job that she hated and an unhealthy diet where she mostly ate on the run he told her that she would have to make changes to her lifestyle or she could have a massive heart attack , especially since there was a history of heart problems in her family see my article how medical problems can change how you feel about yourself donna spoke with her husband about the changes she was thinking about including leaving her stressful job her husband encouraged her to do what she had always wanted to do become a yoga teacher so , when she quit her job , and when her cardiologist gave his approval , donna began a yoga training program soon after she completed the yoga training , she began working for a local yoga studio , a job that she loved in retrospect , she realized that she probably would never have quit her stressful job to do what she really wanted if she had not had the heart attack conclusion making changes in your life , even under the best of circumstances , can be challenging we often become comfortable with what 's familiar , even if it 's not what we want making changes during a crisis is even more challenging because we 're often not prepared for the crisis it can be like a tsunami that comes upon us suddenly being flexible , being able to reframe a crisis into an opportunity if possible , and having emotional support can help you to make positive changes but there are times when the crisis is so overwhelming that it is traumatic in other words , it 's beyond what you can handle , and you might need help from a skilled mental health professional to help you to get through the crisis and come out of it more resilient than before getting help in therapy everyone needs help at some point in his or her life sometimes , friends and family , who are well meaning , are n't helpful because they 're part of the crisis or they 're fearful of change so they ca n't see opportunities or alternatives when you 're overwhelmed by a crisis , you could benefit from working with a skilled mental health professional who can help you to recognize your strengths and help you to regroup see my article the benefits of therapy rather than struggling on your own , if you feel overwhelmed by a crisis in your life , seek help from an experienced psychotherapist who can help you to overcome the current obstacles so you can live a more fulfilling life see my article how to choose a psychotherapist about me i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist who works with individual adults and couples see my article the therapeutic benefits of integrative psychotherapy to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist i have helped many clients to overcome their problems so they could maximize their potential and live the life they want to live to set up a consultation , call me at or email me
