the verdict is in i will be having surgery on my right knee as i expected , i have a torn lateral meniscus the only question remaining is how severely it is torn , and we wo n't know that until my md sticks his scope in there and peeks around so i wo n't know until after i wake up on october th , the day of my surgery , how long my recovery will take it all depends on what my doctor finds and how much of my meniscus he will have to remove it could take a few weeks or a few months obviously , i'm hoping for the former rather than the latter i'm very relieved to finally get moving on this problem it 's been frustrating waiting for my doctor 's appointment when i 've known for a month what was likely going on i'm especially fortunate to have such a good relationship with this md , as his next available surgery appointment was actually in mid november ! instead , he was kind enough to add me to his schedule on what was supposed to be the last day of his upcoming vacation he knows how important running is to my overall health and well being , and we both knew it would be almost impossible for me to wait another weeks for surgery by scheduling me on october th , i may be back to running by mid to late november ! i'm very , very grateful my doctor afforded me such an opportunity i 'll be spending the next days getting ready for surgery there are pre op doctor 's appointments to be attended , and there is paperwork to be completed i also have to work out time off with my boss i do n't know what i'm going to do to pay my bills while i'm out , as i have n't yet accrued enough sick time to cover more than or days off if i do n't work , i do n't get paid i'm worried about that i'm trusting it will all work out i just do n't know how yet i 'll also have to find some volunteers to walk puck while i'm gimping around he wo n't tolerate sitting still for long my yard may need to be mowed or raked , and i do n't know how long i 'll be unable to drive there are a few things to figure out over the next week and a half obviously , getting ready for surgery will require more than just getting ready for the surgery nonetheless , i'm grateful to have a diagnosis that is fixable i'm grateful my md fit me into his personal schedule and i'm really grateful to be moving forward rather than standing still i'm relieved while having surgery may create some other issues , i do n't think any of those issues will be impossible to deal with one day at a time , i 'll deal with them as they arise in the end , i 'll eventually be back to running , and that 's what i'm focused on right now
