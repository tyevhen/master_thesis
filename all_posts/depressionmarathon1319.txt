if ideas were worth dollars , i 'd be a millionaire ! my brain is full of them ! they are literally flying around up there ! what about doing this ? could a person make this do that and that do this ? why is n't anyone doing that ? learning about blogging , developing and marketing an online business , writing there are so many possibilities i am constantly thinking about how to improve , change , or create beneficial products and situations i do n't know why or when this started , but it is getting a bit ridiculous ! you see , i am really good at brainstorming ideas and some plans , but my skill set is limited , whereas my ideas are not i am full of creative ideas bashing around my head as if participants in a roller derby , but i do n't know how to stop the metaphorical action and turn it into physical action which idea do i pluck from the pile up ? where do i take it from there ? if i do n't have the skills , do i throw the idea out , or do i offer it to somebody else ? who ? where do i find that person ? maybe i can learn the skills maybe that 's too overwhelming , and scary , and feels like it would take too long what 's too long ? and on , and on , and on perhaps because of this illness , i have lost the ability to piece together multiple thoughts , concepts , or ideas into one coherent whole it is incredibly frustrating , because it is a skill i implemented with little conscious thought previously without that coherent plan , leaping into action has been a gigantic hurdle inertia and fear grab tight when i only have a fragmented , shifty plan instead of action , i end up with an overcrowded roller derby of ideas , each fighting for position while bombing around my brain and i do n't know what to do with that what do i do with that ? if only ideas were worth dollars i 'd be rich
