call me crazy , but in a lot of ways , i think running a marathon is similar to giving birth athletes train for many months , they mentally prepare themselves by visualizing success , and the race itself is hours of hard work similarly , in a pregnancy , the woman s body is training for weeks , growing the baby , and getting the body ready to bring him or her into the world the actual delivery can be hard work , and you have to be mentally prepared to experience intense physical and emotional changes of course , there are many differences between having a baby and running a marathon obviously , one being the end reward in one case you get a baby , and in the other case you get a medal and t shirt nonetheless , i still think my experience with running a marathon has enlightened me about this whole labor and delivery journey looking back on my marathon , i would not describe it as painful i would tell you that it was one of the hardest things i ever did , but i wouldn t tell you it was excruciatingly painful because it wasn t i look back on it with joy and a sense of accomplishment yeah , it was really extremely difficult , but i d do it again someday i m approaching having a baby with the same attitude i had going into my marathon i decided to do a marathon and i committed myself to whatever it took to get it done similarly , i am determined to bring this baby into a peaceful , calm , loving environment i know it s not going to be a walk in the park , but it also doesn t have to be a traumatizing experience it will still be hard work , but if i prepare myself adequately , it doesn t have to be painful the main point being i don t have to be afraid women have been giving birth since the beginning of time only recently did women start running marathons the reason i was successful in completing my marathon had to do with three important factors first , i trained for several months my body was in condition to run really long distances second , i had incredible support from my husband during training , he encouraged me when i was down , he helped me get up for my early morning runs , and he taught me tricks and tips from his own experience he also ran a marathon then , during the race , he took care of the logistics , he was there cheering me on , and he even ran a total of about miles next to me throughout the whole thing he believed in me he knew i could do it and that is powerful stuff that brings up the last factor , mentally preparedness i knew the race itself was going to be more mentally challenging than physically challenging i knew that toward the end of the race , i would have to fight the demons in my head trying to convince me it was better to stop yet , because i knew this was going to happen , i mentally prepare to keep going even when my will power was growing weak by the time race day came , i was determined to finish nothing or no one could have stopped me from completing my goal i was so focused that toward the end , around mile , i tuned out all of my surroundings and concentrated on looking straight forward , putting one foot in front of the other you could say i entered a sort of self hypnosis i am approaching the arrival of our son or daughter with all three of those factors in mind , especially considering the mental preparation because of my experience with depression and anxiety , i am keenly aware of the body mind connection if your mind s not onboard , then your body will reflect how you feel you have to lead with your mind and the body will follow you can accomplish amazing feats when , in your head , you believe you can the same is true for birthing if you are afraid , you will be tense and not be able to let your body do what it is made to do if you don t believe you can do it , then you won t but , if you are aware of the power of your body , then you can in order to prepare for labor , i ve been practicing these relaxation methods to maintain an overall state of calm lots of hardcore runners will tell you , in order to stay relaxed and not waste extra energy , you must keep your facial muscles loose and relaxed i practiced this every run a mind that is stressed and afraid will reflect in a body that is tense and rigid to be able to finish a long distance race , you have to stay calm and relaxed and it begins with the muscles in the face i think the same is true for birthing in the past , i ve utilized meditation tracks to help me overcome my anxiety slow breathing , eyes closed , peacefully music essentially , i m doing the same thing now , only with more of a centralized focus on the task at hand labor and delivery i m working on achieving a state of calm no matter what s going on around me i cannot believe how much it has changed my attitude i m not afraid or dreading the experience anymore i am actually excited about this labor of love and can t wait to bring our child into this world practicing these relaxation techniques are going to help me with more than just having a baby i know that these skills will help me with future stressful situations hopefully , i will be able to continue to reduce my anxiety so that the baby will have a loving , peaceful mom and a happy , positive environment throughout the duration of his or her life books i ve recently read that have helped me form these thoughts ina may s guide to childbirth by
