hi there ! as promised , i am back today to share my favorite books that have gotten me through some tough moments with a young baby ! i consider these to be must haves we 're talking must read before baby arrives this way , when something perplexes you , you may have something you 've read about pop into your mind to help you i wish i 'd read all these before i had paige , but i read them once i was desperate for help during her scream fits once i read these , i was able to curb our issues and move forward smoothly yay ! healthy sleep habits , happy child by marc weissbluth this is my favorite it 's very sciencey in the beginning i read some of it and wanted to snore , so i skipped to the parts about the baby newborn through months that 's what 's great about this book you can skip around and read what is going to be helpful for you in the moment without having to read the whole thing in order i 've followed his techniques to the letter and the kiddos are great sleepers thus far i use it even now for paige and am refreshing my reading now that noah is in the mix it 's comforting and full of tips when you are at wits end about a new issue that pops up inevitably happiest baby on the block by harvey karp this book is another must before baby arrives if you are adopting an older child , you may not need this one it 's specific to newborn more early infancy this book focuses on how to most efficiently and effectively soothe your baby when fussy or upset it discusses the famous s 's swaddle , side , swish sway , shhhh , and suck but , it 's not just knowing these that helps it 's how to do them properly and effectively and in exact order for example , i was swaying paige , but never in the right way once i followed the book 's suggestions , she would settle right away and i use all the techniques with noah to soothe him before sleep time and he has n't had any crying fits rages he 's months old tomorrow ! again , read this book before baby arrives and you 'll be totally prepared from day one ! secrets of the baby whisperer by tracy hogg this one is a combination of books and above but , there 's lots of other advice and information in it that i found very helpful she mentions keeping to a sort of routine each day to maintain sanity , order and expectation for you and baby i loved having this book in tandem with the others you can read it before baby and it 's helpful once baby arrives it has lots of great simple advice and i highly recommend it ! supernanny how to get the best from your children by jo frost this book has been helpful with paige when she was about a year old and beyond it discusses more about good hygiene habits , eating , discipline , etc it 's written in a really simple and helpful way not a must have , but i feel it 's a good read of course , i have the what to expect series helpful , but the small anecdotes always leaving me wanting more information i prefer the dr spock sort of medical manuals for the nuts bolts of baby child care the information is a little more expanded and a bit easier to find so , those are my top picks ! i 've read a ton of different books , but those are my bibles and feel that you can conquer anything with them lol hope you find this little list helpful ! ! ! save you might also like books that help book of the week book of the week linkwithin
