it 's difficult to imagine feeling much worse my body aches with emotional pain depression thick and heavy has a stranglehold on my soul it takes all my energy to move within my home from one room to the next laundry , my task for today , will be an all day affair it hurts to breathe it hurts to breathe if i was n't experiencing it myself , i would n't believe it possible it 's difficult to imagine feeling much worse it 's also hard to imagine feeling more debilitated by this illness i am useless , hopeless , and discouraged i am at a loss as to what to do next it 's hard to think when expending so much energy just staying alive i am literally living one moment to the next here this is not how i want to live , but this is what i 've got right now i'm tired , but i'm still standing i 'll keep doing my best while praying for relief
