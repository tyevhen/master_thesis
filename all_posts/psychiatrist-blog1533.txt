happy new year everyone , i'm back i'm not sure how i feel about it yet , but i'm here i had a wonderful break , the fall of was a very stressful time here , and so i'm hoping for calmer days in it started out pretty good dancing on the beach at midnight as the year began so warm weather zones , while wonderful for the soul , are just not good for frizzly hair i was at breakfast , a few days after rang in i lost track of the days on vacation and the waiter at breakfast took one look at me and said your hair , it stands straight up , it 's like a cat that 's scared ! oy these things bounce off me , humidity , i forgot to pack a brush , i 'd slept on it but then i snuck away after breakfast to check my e mail i was good , i only checked it twice and i see that clinkshrink and roy are doing a superb job keeping up the blog , and that clink has wished me a year of good hair days funny , but i felt like maybe this wish , on the heals of the waiter 's comment , might not be such a good omen for
