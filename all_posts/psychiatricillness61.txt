i am still at my mum 's although i am going to try and do some work tomorrow or evven later today i think my agitation is stress related as well as the side effect of aripiprazole i spoke to my psychiatrist this morning and i am to reduce both the aripiprazole back to mg daily and the queytiapine is to be reduced further to mg daily and we will review on monday he thinks it is a transition problem and will calm down i hope so as i am certainly enjoying having those few extra hours in the day ! my mind is quiet , it is not like anxiety , but i keep getting up like i need or want to be doing something i just do n't seem to be ableto settle down and get on with anything at all perhaps that is why i am doing lots of short blog posts
