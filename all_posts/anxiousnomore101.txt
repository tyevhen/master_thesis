i 've been wanting a way to have some sort of discussion section of the blog so that we can come together as a community and talk with each other about what works for us , or just to sympathize with each other , or talk about whatever we want for awhile i was thinking of doing a facebook fan page but i was hesitant because a lot of people would rather be anonymous as opposed to having their friends and family able to view their anxiety posts so i found a forum that we can use i 've started a couple posts for people to introduce themselves and talk about what your triggers are , but feel free to start your own post topic right now its a free program so its ad supported and the categories are limited but if this is something that takes off and you are interested in it , i will upgrade to a better non ad version so what do you think ? you can click here to go to the forum , or there is also a button at the top of the home page that will direct you there and if you have n't already , do n't forget to enter the giveaway ! ! ! if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like upgraded the forum what is rss ? how to stay up to date with the reality of adding twitter , facebook , and followers spammers ruin everything linkwithin
