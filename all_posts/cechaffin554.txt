naturally i do n't share everything here i share what i can while preserving a modicum of privacy , because of this medium and i do n't want to pander to peyton place voyeurism but today i think people thirst for the authentically personal because their lives are inundated with impersonal information it 's odd how this blog has evolved i started with humorous essays , of which i 've published dozens elsewhere they were n't very popular then i related our difficulties in mexico , where kathleen 's hearing ear dog was held for a , ransom i would have paid the money if i 'd had it instead there were six months of captivity in a land i have come to detest people were interested in that struggle finally , after that stress was over , and we got our own place back in california , i sank into a depression it 's somewhat typical for a bipolar to react after the stress is over , much like migraine sufferers get their headaches when the final is over how i wish i only suffered migraines ! but suffering is not ours to choose adventure is chosen , suffering is imposed so now my blog has morphed into two streams probably the two things i know most about on this planet manic depression and poetry i dread the former and love the latter the fact that the two are inextricably linked through history makes for a nice fit , though i 'd rather talk about poetry than mood disorders i teach poetry online i also counsel bipolars and many of the poets i know are also bipolar one student , long since graduated , has been in the bughouse nearly times , and she goes on but she 's in that lucky of bipolars who suffer more from mania than depression on the net i'm best known as a poet yet in my bios i pointedly included my bipolar disease for the sake of honesty am i proud to be a bipolar ? no , that would be like being proud of my height i had little to do with either they were the cards i was dealt , along with lumbar scoliosis , and later , severe degenerative disk disease frankly , i resent the hell out of being manic depressive it has been a curse and also the strongest single determinant in the major choices of my life my great burden is that i have been able to function at a high level even while psychotic , which prevented treatment i 've won many academic awards while essentially psychotic and wondering why they were given to me thus i came to treatment late in my psychiatry residency i was the golden boy so no one on the faculty considered the possibility i might have major mental illness when i got sick and had to drop out so , in a sense , my intelligence and the stoic endurance my mother instilled in me have worked against me i never knew when to say uncle when i was finally diagnosed it took a good friend , also a psych resident , to persuade me to come to his hospital for treatment and in my th year i finally met a doctor who made the diagnosis in all of half an hour and so it goes today i'm probably at kilorats on the bright side , when i awoke , i did have feelings of love for my beautiful wife it 's good to know they 're still there , since depression reduces all feelings to a flat landscape of obsidian squares beneath a brass sky i'm laying off posting poems for now if any readers wish for me to post them more often , i 'll be happy to comply thine in truth and art , ce
