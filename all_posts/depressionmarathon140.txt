i just returned home from my th physical therapy session it 's been almost one month since i began rehab on the alter g treadmill today i ran on the alter g for minutes , at pace , at of my body weight this was the first time i ran at of my body weight we tried advancing to early last week , but my achilles began to hurt almost immediately , so back down to we went i ran the full minutes today without increased soreness it 's progress slow , slow progress i'm trying to be patient with this return to running i must admit , though , i figured i 'd be back on the roads by now instead , i'm only up to running at body weight on a treadmill i 've got a long way to go , and i did n't think it would take this long to get there but i'm trying to be patient i am grateful my achilles did n't hurt today my worst fear is another setback i'm not sure i could handle that speaking of not handling i 've got more issues with my mouth it seems i have a crown that 's loose , at least i hope that 's all it is now this typically would n't be a big deal , but with all the issues i 've had with my mouth over the last two years braces , oral surgeries , fractured and extracted teeth it became a much bigger deal in my head to fix it means money more on that later it also means coordinating with the orthodontist to remove the braces at his office , then traveling to and fixing the crown at the dentist 's office , before traveling back to the orthodontist to reassemble the braces it 's going to be a pain in the butt and it stresses me out the crown came loose yesterday afternoon , coincidentally about one hour prior to my second consult with an oral surgeon regarding replacing my missing canine tooth and molar with implants my first consult a couple of months ago was discouraging the molar is going to be simple the canine tooth is going to be complicated , costly and time consuming unfortunately , the second consult yesterday resulted in the same recommendations and cautions here 's what needs to happen after i am finished with the braces , which may be another months a full year longer than the orthodontist expected me to need them , i'm going to need the first of at least two bone grafting procedures there is no guarantee bone will grow , but if it does , i will almost certainly need another procedure months after the first if sufficient bone grows , i will get the initial implant hardware months later it is n't until those implants heal , another months , that i will finally get the actual teeth crowns and will be able to smile without a hole in my face it 's going to be a long , painful road again , i'm trying to be patient it 's hard to be patient , though , when the road feels so long and i 'd be lying if i said the whole process was n't totally stressing me out never mind the pain of multiple oral surgeries financially , i'm not sure how it 's going to work out one estimate was , the other estimate of total cost was just over , i do n't have that kind of money thank you , depression i am able to take a loan out against the value of my vehicle , which i just paid off , but loans need to be repaid like i said , i do n't know how it 's going to work out i'm just going to have to say a few prayers and believe it will so i'm focusing forward to get through the long roads ahead when i find myself worrying about my achilles and the too slow progress i'm making , i try instead to visualize running freely and think about how grateful and happy i will feel when i'm back on the road my patience will pay off when i find myself disgusted with and stressed by all the issues , complications , pain and expense of my mouth , i try to visualize a smile free of brackets and holes i imagine what it will be like to chew without struggle or pain i 've got a lot of years of a wide smile ahead this too shall pass eventually i 've got to continue to practice patience easier said than done , but i 'll keep at it
