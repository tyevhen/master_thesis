i read this short article in the big think and found it interesting if this is successful in humans , it would be a major step forward in treating some cancers every time i read about chemotherapy , i remember an original star trek episode where bones is talking to spock he explains a barbaric torture that th century doctors used to treat cancer called chemotherapy scientists get cancer cells to commit suicide by orion jones what 's the latest development ? scientists have found a special molecule that activates the body 's own tumor killing system , causing the death of cancerous tissue in mice while preserving the integrity of healthy cells the molecule , tic , activates the gene for a protein called trail tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand , which has long been a target for cancer researchers looking for drugs that would avoid the debilitating effects of conventional therapies experiments showed that tic had potent effects against a variety of tumors , including breast , lymphatic , colon and lung cancer what 's the big idea ? the tic molecule has been shown to be especially effective at triggering cell suicide in gliobastoma , a kind of brain tumor that is notoriously difficult to treat by activating the trail gene in cancerous and healthy cells , cell suicide is induced in cancer cells immediately next to healthy ones wafik el deiry , an oncologist at pennsylvania state university in hershey and lead author of the study , said trail is a part of our immune system all of us with functional immune systems use this molecule to keep tumors from forming or spreading , so boosting this will not be as toxic as chemotherapy
