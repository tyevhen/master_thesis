in yesterday 's post , i posed a bunch of really hard human factors questions what got me thinking about all that was the simple question when if ever is a program too feature rich ? maybe it 's not possible for a software system to be too feature rich perhaps it 's all a question of how features are organized and exposed after all , a laptop computer in its entirety operating system , drivers , software , everything can be considered a single software system a single meta app , with various child components having names like chrome , microsoft word , photoshop , etc imagine how many features are buried in a laptop , if you include the operating system plus everything on down all software applications of all kinds we 're talking hundreds of thousands of features , total and yet , users manage , somehow , to cope with all that complexity or maybe i should say , users try like hell to cope with it often , it 's a struggle given the fact that people still do buy enormously complex software systems and manage to cope with them , to the point of making them worthwhile to own , maybe something like total feature count does n't matter at all , in and of itself , where usability is concerned or does it ? there are still people in this world who are afraid to use a computer and or terrified to use a smart phone or an ipad , either because it 's too hard , too apt to make the user feel stupid , or whatnot those of us who do use such devices daily tend to chuckle at the fears of the computer illiterate we tell them there 's nothing to be afraid of and then expect them to get over their fears instantly when they do n't , we scoff but really , should we be judging the user friendliness of a software system by how easy it is for the majority of users to adapt to it often with a certain amount of pain and difficulty ? or should we instead be judging a system 's usability by the number of people who are afraid of it ? why should n't we be designing systems for the computer fearful rather than for the computer literate ? it 's easy to say that something like total feature count does n't matter as long as the software 's or device 's interface is good the problem is , it 's never really very good i consider myself a fairly computer literate person at this point i 've written programs in assembly language for intel and motorola powered machines i can read and write c , javascript , java , and under duress a few other programming languages i 've written plug ins or extensions for a dozen well known desktop programs , and i have seven software patents to my name but there are still software systems in this world mostly enterprise that make me feel stupid if someone like myself feels stupid when confronted by a certain device or software system , is n't that an indictment of the software or device ? or do i deserve to feel stupid , since thousands of other people are able to get work done using the same software ? if there are people in this world who do n't know how to set the time and date on a coffee maker , is n't that an indictment of the coffee maker ? if someone ca n't figure out how to operate a cable tv channel changer , is n't that an indictment of the device itself ? i do n't have hard and fast answers to these questions but i think it 's fair to raise the questions i 'll go further and say every user or potential buyer of software , or software powered devices , should definitely raise these questions also every company that designs and sells software , or software powered devices , needs to raise these questions so raise them , i say if you 're a software or device maker , have the necessary dialog , in your company , to get a strategy together for dealing with these sorts of issues get users involved in the discussion come up with a trackable plan for implementing possible solutions then follow up with customers to see if the solutions are actually accomplishing the desired purpose and if you 're a customer ? ask yourself how smart or how stupid you feel when using a given product and then , if you have a choice , vote with your wallet
