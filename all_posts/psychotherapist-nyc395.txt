try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language rainer maria rilke in a prior article , i discussed how to choose a therapist and gave some tips on choosing a psychotherapist who is best for you a sense of openness and curiosity in therapy in this article , i'm focusing on a healthy way to approach therapy people who are considering therapy , who have never been in therapy before , often ask me how they should approach this personal exploration , and i usually respond by suggesting that they start therapy with a sense of curiosity and openness many people have concerns about whether they 're ready for therapy , what it will be like and if the therapist will judge them starting therapy with a sense of curiosity and openness i 've been on both sides of the couch , so to speak i know how difficult it can be , especially for someone who has never been in therapy before , to begin therapy a number of years ago , after graduate school , as part of my training to become a psychotherapist , i was required to be in my own three time per week therapy for four years i remember very clearly what it was like to attend psychotherapy consultations with various therapists , who were connected to my training program , and what it was like to choose a therapist for my four year postgraduate training it was a daunting task initially , i had many of the same concerns that most people have where do i start ? how much should i divulge about myself during the initial therapy consultation ? what will the process be like ? will the therapist be judgmental and see me as being unfit to be a therapist ? since the therapists who were on the list were also part of the training institute , it was a bit of a fish bowl experience , and i discovered that many other people in the psychotherapy training program felt the same way starting therapy with a sense of curiosity and openness but , over time , i and most of my peers overcame these feelings and we learned to become open and curious about the therapeutic process i was also fortunate to find a therapist who was empathetic and a good fit for me , which is very important therapy as a process of self exploration many people come to therapy because they want to overcome specific issues others just have a sense that they 're not feeling right and they do n't understand why they sense they need to change in some way , but they 're not sure how or why starting therapy with a sense of curiosity and openness whatever leads you to consider psychotherapy , a sense of openness and curiosity helps you to expand your sense of self awareness and develop emotional insight it can also help you to make important changes in your life i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist who works with individual adults and couples to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at or email me josephineolivia aol com also see my articles psychotherapy from a strengths based perspective seeing the whole person overcoming your fear of starting therapy to overcome emotional trauma psychotherapy listening and learning from the client mind body psychotherapy the body as a window into the unconscious mind
