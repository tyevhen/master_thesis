i think today 's poem was inspired by yesterday 's blog about richard ford 's existence period ordinary i never thought i d be so ordinary another acorn or a worker ant , another paper thrown onto the driveway with the same weak , pink rubber band are you ordinary , too ? without a medal or a guinness record , unable to juggle more than two balls at a time ? i make good omelets my secret is the microwave i cast lures well using a spinning reel but have never learned to fly fish that 's what high class fishermen do i glory in the ordinary ! and why not ? what pumps up most of us beyond our fellows is just the stuffing of tires with excess air it is enough for me to sweep the porch , answer my e mails , sometimes get drunk ok get drunk more than that thine as ever , ce
