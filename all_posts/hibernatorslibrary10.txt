the unwinding is the first book for my discussion of books to explain trump 's win , and this is the first of three discussion posts question this story was separated into biographies of several people which presumably will teach us why the populism movement has become popular in america whose story was most moving interesting to you ? tammy thomas 's story was most moving to me because it reminded me of a book i read for my social justice book club men we reaped , by jesmyn ward i had been wondering if ward 's experience with the deaths of blacks in the poorer class black community were unique the implication was that it was not , but i'm a skeptic sometimes indeed , although there were fewer deaths involved in thomas 's story , it confirmed that deaths are a more common experience than i expected in this community that , to me , is tragic the most interesting story was oprah 's i guess i was never a fan of the oprah book club because many selections are about miserable people being miserable , as morphy would say do n't get me wrong , there are a few good ones in there however , this section was the only section where i could totally see packer 's point that the pipe dreams encouraged by oprah could bring people down question what do you think his thesis is ? was it made clear in this section i have to admit that i do n't know what his point is with any of the stories except the tammy thomas 's , the walmart one , and the oprah one that there are reasons other than the obvious ones that poorer people who are brought down by these circumstances but i guess that 's because i already expected this theme in jeff connaughton 's story i think the point is that lobbyists encourage corruption in washington the others , maybe that these successful people increase the poor rich financial divide question what do you think of the format of the book , where it is split into biographies instead of a straightforward narrative ? personally , i'm skeptical that i will be able to see a strong thesis , though the reviews certainly imply that i am wrong i would prefer a straightforward narrative because the people are hard to keep track of , though i think it 's a very creative way to share a thesis if that , indeed , is what happens in the end question so far , a lot of the narrative about successful people does this surprise you ? as i said in my answer to question , i expected stories about down trodden people who want to make america great again
