good morning i'm typing very quickly because i 'd like to put up a blog post before the power company de electrifies me for the day this is the th attempt to take down our dying old oak tree , and it looks like it may actually happen today and there went the power hours later , the power is back and now my house looks naked without it 's oak tree not a person and it was n't safe to leave it up any longer but i am feeling a bit of grief for both the tree and the shade and the way my house looked when i woke up today that said , i wanted to share an article with you that i read in the nytimes opinionator grieving my patient 's friend is a heartwarming piece by galit atlas who is a therapist who comes to feel attached to his patient 's friend , and then learns she is dying i loved this piece because i identified with it so strongly i 've listened to the stories of other people , imagined what they were like , and gone through their traumas , celebrations and , like the author , even their deaths oddly enough , i sometimes hear about the same people and their stories from several patients , or learn the fate of a friend or family member of one patient years later from another patient so altas writes it isn t unusual for therapists to feel that they know intimately their patients friends , lovers and family in some ways , we get attached to these people , their stories , their successes and struggles we accompany them at once closely and from far away , as if they are favorite characters in a beloved book she tells the story of her patient , naomi , and of naomi 's dying friend isabella naomi had looked at me and then added , can you believe it really happened ? i lost isabella she will never come back oddly , i felt that i had lost something as well but mine was an unusual , unrecognized loss i grieved for a woman i had never really known , and no one could see or acknowledge my pain i was alone with it it 's a poignant piece so i hope you enjoy it
