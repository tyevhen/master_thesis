i was a dumbass and let myself run out of ativan i 've been without it for two nights , and for two nights i have n't slept at all well oddly , i 've been able to get to sleep i just ca n't stay asleep i wake up every hour and a half apparently , this corresponds to sleep cycles , feeling anxious , coming out of what feels sort of like but not quite an anxiety tinged dream it 's as if i'm obsessing and ruminating in my sleep in a way that i do n't actually do when i'm awake thanks , abilify ! when i was first prescribed ativan a few years ago , my doctor told me that it was n't a sleep medication per se it 's a make your brain shut up medication it 's supposed to quiet those thoughts that keep us from falling asleep these are usually anxious thoughts , but in my case they can be everything from anxious or depressive thoughts , to thoughts about my next art project , to thoughts about the space program ativan is a benzodiazapene , which means that your body will build up a tolerance to it maybe this is rebound anxiety from suddenly having my mgs of ativan cut off i just wish to gods that i 'd been on top of the refill my meds supposedly shipped last friday , so it 's been four business days and i should have them tomorrow at the latest for now , i'm at the point where i might have to try clonopin again or risk something seriously weird happening to my brain clonopin made me feel ill after just two nights at mgs i was prescribed mgs i managed to cut my half pill in half last time i wonder if i can cut my quarter pill in half again ?
