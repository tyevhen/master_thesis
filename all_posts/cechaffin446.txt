kenyon my dog limps , so i wrap his leg with tape his aging has accelerated now it s months , not years , until his great escape my wife , she weeps to see him in such shape i miss the playfulness he used to show my dog limps , so i wrap his leg with tape when he sleeps i don t know if he will wake to die asleep might be the kindest blow it s months , not years , until his great escape sometimes he stares out into the landscape and stops as if confused , and i allow my dog limps so i wrap his leg with tape when he squats to poop , his hips will shake making it difficult for him to do it s months , not years , until his great escape is it too soon or late for god to take this creature we so loved from here below ? my dog limps , so i wrap his leg with tape it s months , not years , until his great escape not much to report today it s raining here after the rain a mist will rise among the redwoods like the forest s breath the smell of wet trees and earth is the smell of life as much as the ocean s , though i have long favored the ocean my medications have numbed me to a degree , but i can still feel the pit that is my heart under the mist i try to be useful each day , though there is no pleasure in it when i prepare to take up a new task , however mundane , my anxiety rises and the chatter of self denigrating voices begins i wish i had a nickel for every time my brain told me i m worthless my psychiatrist talks about self worth as if i only had to inhale it he has no gift for those with severe affective disorders talk therapy does no good , however skillful the practitioner when my mood flips i don t need it when i m in a down cycle , i ll listen to nearly any suggestion out of desperation , even though i know only time , medication , or ect will work in my case luckily i have a tentative appointment next week with a psychiatrist better versed in managing medications perhaps he can make the adjustments i need this sputtering depression is now seven months long , my longest since how i wish i could feel hope again ! at least i have , in this most recent dip , been able to feel love for my wife she is my anchor if it were in me , i d get well for her tomorrow , because she sees both me and kenyon suffering and sometimes she can t bear it i m tearing up as i write this , because one symptom of depression is sorrow over one s effect on loved ones you want to spare them the pain this is a frequent justification for suicide in the depressive you d all be better off without me in actuality this constitutes a narcissistic lie , and the act of suicide , outside of a terminal illness , is the most selfish act one can commit yet in the deepest of depressions it takes a powerful moral core not to give in to the option i m not troubled by thoughts of suicide as much as i was when i was younger and depressed back then i had to wrestle with the question daily now , by long practice , it rarely enters my mind with any force i have foresworn that option , one benefit of a lifelong struggle with this disease , which has over a lifetime mortality if not properly treated happy thoughts for a friday , right ? but i doubt people don t come here for happy thoughts i think they come to read the truth as best i can tell it , or possibly to sample a poem though in my exercise in form i may at times be writing only verse at kilorats , ce
