brrrr it is cold here in minnesota ! shocking , i know it was barely above zero today i believe it is exactly degree fahrenheit right now this morning , with the mph winds , the windchill was something like to that 's to degrees below zero ! i had a mile run on my schedule the smart thing to do , the reasonable thing to do , i figured , was drive to the gym and get on the treadmill but then again , i never , ever claimed to be reasonable or smart after not too much deliberation , the thought of getting into an ice cold vehicle , with too little clothing , and driving ice cold minutes to run boring miles without moving an inch , was less appealing to me than layering up , slipping plastic baggies over my wool socks , covering most of my head and face in fleece , and stepping out the side door into the crisp , bright , breezy day i had a great run ! i put on just the right amount of gear , and i was quite comfortable i tried to avoid running into the wind when i could the fresh snow made for soft , secure footing the bright sun reflecting off that snow made the scenery lovely , and i had the local running routes all to myself instead of the five miles i had scheduled , i ran eight and a half i looked like a frosty eskimo when i got home , but the bragging rights i earned were priceless after such a nice run , the rest of my day was a breeze work was quite busy and ran long , so i grabbed some chinese food on the way home and , as usual , ate way too much i'm expecting a long day tomorrow , too , but i only have a miler to complete and the high is supposed to be a whopping degrees ! that should be a cinch !
