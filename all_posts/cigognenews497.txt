this article was first published on october , i just want to run it again , as it is so important i have been thinking about evolution in regard to psychotherapy last night there was a program on evolution scientists from several countries convened to discuss the possible evolution of dinosaurs there were many explanations , none satisfying one , however , seemed credible the question was which came first dinosaurs or birds ? , since fossils were found of dinosaurs with feathers they studied birds found near the site that had similar appendages as dinosaurs and filmed them they found that these birds were born knowing only how to run as their personal evolution continued they began to fly this seemingly added evidence to the notion that birds came second , not first that birds evolved out of dinosaurs , not the reverse it is still a moot question but it led me to think about our own therapy observing a primal session explained so much about evolution specifically , about the primacy of thoughts over feelings in a reliving , feelings come before thoughts , as they did in evolution and indeed , as feelings become preponderant they nudge thoughts and beliefs into action those thoughts evolve out the feelings being suffocated during birth leading to , he suffocates me there is no space for me , etc what resolves this is not a change in attitude or thoughts but feelings the imprint , the generating source needs to be addressed and relived because it was not fully relived originally it was at best partially experienced when it happened and then shut off due to its load of pain it needs to be fully lived , connected and resolved when we look at the session we are exploring evolution observing both phylogeny and ontogeny it is my position that unless the system is allowed to follow evolution exactly there will only be abreaction and not a connected , resolved feeling that is the reason to pay attention to evolution during a reliving of birth where we find skyrocketing vital signs there can be no crying like a two year old , no radical movements of the legs and arms and no words whatsoever all these come later in personal evolution ontogeny to do all this now is to defy evolution , which violates biology and how it progresses we cannot get ahead of ourselves in therapy evolution is not to be fooled with if we do not believe in it then all is lost and therapy is a useless exercise the minute a patient who is reliving something in early childhood uses words like entertaining , satisfaction , disappointed , we know she is not in the feeling brain and it is not a real experience a five year does not normally use those words in other words , evolution is a check on the reality of what the patient is undergoing if we don t know how the brain develops , at least minimally , then we might err in therapy worse , we might push the patient beyond her tolerance level , beyond where evolution allows her to go for the moment we might push her back into her history where massive pain lies and all that will accomplish is overload and then symbolic acting out or acting in example a patient was coming close to a feeling of a sexual seduction by her father the therapist was pushing for her to get there she reached the lip of the feeling and then sat up and said , i ve been saved ! saved by the lord she was saved by the thought of the lord as the feeling nudged the thinking believing centers into action to protect against feelings here evolution rushed in to save the situation and it did so in orderly fashion so when we observe progress during a session we are seeing how the brain works what functions it uses to protect us , how it recruits thoughts to make us safe and neurotic , at the same time we see how neurosis can take place most of all , we learn how to do the therapy what biologic laws not to violate what we also learn is how impossible it is to fulfill needs that are long past their due date when we look at the evolution of babies we learn the laws of fetal and infancy evolution what are the key needs and , above all , when they can be fulfilled that critical window of need cannot be violated after the window is closed there is no fulfillment possible , only amelioration we cannot love neurosis away pain is stronger than that once we begin to understand all this we know that we cannot use a later developing mechanism , thoughts , to bring about change in neurosis thoughts then become a cover for feelings , not a resolving process one reason this is not primal scream therapy is that screams come after grunts in evolution on the way out of the womb but not as yet out , there seem to be no screams if we force screams we are wrong if we try to make something dramatic happen to prove how smart and effective we are the patient will suffer if we are patient and trust evolution we are on the right tract
