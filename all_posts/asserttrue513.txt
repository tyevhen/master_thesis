i remember , in college , writing a paper i thought was pretty darned good it came back with scores of words and phrases circled , with the notation trite i was shocked beyond belief to see things like the fact of the matter and high time and as luck would have it circled i actually thought that such colloquialisms , precisely because of their familiarity , would make my paper easier to digest and better all the way around the quoted phrases are trite , of course it never occurred to me that perfectly serviceable everyday phrases could actually be a bad thing decades later , i see my professor 's point it 's not that trite phrases are n't easy to understand they obviously are , or people would n't use them but that they 're unoriginal , bland , banal , and bromidic they represent missed opportunities to inject vitality into a piece of writing the surprising thing about cliches in english is how ancient some of them are many of our most cherished cliches are , in fact , over years old and trace directly to shakespeare all that glitters glisters is not gold the merchant of venice all 's well that ends well title as good luck would have it the merry wives of windsor bated breath the merchant of venice a charmed life macbeth be all and end all macbeth better foot before best foot forward king john the better part of valor is discretion i henry iv neither a borrower nor a lender be hamlet brave new world the tempest break the ice the taming of the shrew budge an inch measure for measure taming of the shrew cold comfort the taming of the shrew king john come what come may come what may macbeth dead as a doornail henry vi let slip the dogs of war julius caesar devil incarnate titus andronicus henry v eaten me out of house and home henry iv elbow room king john faint hearted i henry vi fancy free midsummer night 's dream fight till the last gasp i henry vi flaming youth hamlet forever and a day as you like it for goodness' sake henry viii foregone conclusion othello full circle king lear the game is up cymbeline give the devil his due i henry iv good riddance troilus and cressida it is as greek to me julius caesar heart of gold henry v high time the comedy of errors hoist with his own petard hamlet household words henry v ill wind henry iv heart of hearts hamlet mind 's eye hamlet in a pickle the tempest it smells to heaven hamlet kill with kindness taming of the shrew killing frost henry viii knit brow the rape of lucrece laughing stock the merry wives of windsor laugh yourself into stitches twelfth night lean and hungry julius caesar lie low much ado about nothing live long day julius caesar love is blind merchant of venice strange bedfellows the tempest much ado about nothing title naked truth love 's labours lost neither rhyme nor reason as you like it not slept one wink cymbeline one fell swoop macbeth loved not wisely but too well othello jaws of death twelfth night flesh and blood hamlet star crossed lovers romeo and juliet what 's past is prologue the tempest pitched battle taming of the shrew play fast and loose king john pomp and circumstance othello pound of flesh the merchant of venice primrose path hamlet salad days antony and cleopatra sea change the tempest seen better days as you like it send packing i henry iv make short shrift richard iii sick at heart hamlet snail paced troilus and cressida something in the wind the comedy of errors something wicked this way comes macbeth sorry sight macbeth sound and fury macbeth spotless reputation richard ii the short and the long of it the merry wives of windsor sweets to the sweet hamlet there 's the rub hamlet too much of a good thing as you like it tower of strength richard iii truth will out the merchant of venice wear my heart upon my sleeve othello what 's done is done macbeth a rose by any other name would smell as sweet romeo and juliet what the dickens the merry wives of windsor wild goose chase romeo and juliet the world 's my oyster merry wives of windsor yeoman 's service hamlet any time you use one of these stock phrases so original in their own time so stale in ours , you 're joining a centuries old procession of uninspired writers who 've chosen convention over creativity , banality over originality , processed white flour over whole grain goodness plus you 're stealing from another writer i say leave the poor bastard alone he 's been plagiarized way too many times
