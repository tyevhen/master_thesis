i went on an internet hiatus the last few weeks , and it was good i was amazed at how much more productive i was during that time without social media distracting me i was able to get so much housework done , did a lot of cooking and baking , got completely caught up on laundry , spent a lot of extra time in god 's word , did some rearranging in our home , and spent a lot of time doing tasks outside in the gardens and with the animals i also had time to spend reading aloud with the kids , something we have n't really done since we finished up our homeschool year back in may it 's been good and although i'm back online now , i'm going to make sure that i restrict my access that means that the laptop stays off and put away during the day until all of my tasks are completed , and even after that , i know that i need to put a time limit on myself i have come to realize that i was using the internet as a way to kind of escape the everyday drudgery i would look online for inspiration , but i would spend so much time looking that i did n't have any time to do and then , of course , there is the comparison trap that we all fall into from time to time anyway , did i mention that going offline was good ? it 's been a good month a productive month a focused month a restful month a contented month
