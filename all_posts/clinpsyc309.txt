according to a new study in the archives of general psychiatry the authors estimate that about a quarter of depression diagnoses merely reflect people having a difficult time adjusting to a loss in other words , people often become upset , sometimes exhibiting symptoms of depression sadness , lack of pleasure in formerly pleasurable activities , excessive guilt , etc , when they lose a job , a pet , etc the current diagnostic system does not weed out these people as not having depression in fact , the only thing that counts as an excuse to have a significant number of depressive symptoms is bereavement having a loved one die so if you lose a job , get divorced , lose a pet , have a falling out in a relationship with a friend or family member , etc the current system says if you have significant symptoms of depression for two weeks or more , then bam , you 're depressed and we all know that depression is predominantly treated with medications sure , you might get psychotherapy but the odds of receiving medication are certainly greater than getting psychotherapy the epidemic of depression has been very sweet to those who sell ssris so , to summarize , tens of thousands of people who have been experiencing difficulties as a result of a loss of some sort have likely been mislabeled as depressed , likely leading to unnecessary treatment should real depression be treated ? yep should people receive therapy of some sort because their boyfriend girlfriend kicked them to the curb and that 's led to a rough month in their life ? hmmm hat tip furious seasons btw , i 'd like to write something waaaaaaay more insightful here , but there 's only hours in a day , so maybe next week ? ? update read the comments ! excellent points made by three individuals so far feel free to join the conversation
