most of what i share is advice and theory , deeply rooted in my personal experiences , but not often about my own learning journey so as the new year starts and thanks to a bit of inspiration from sue patterson s unschooling manifesto i wanted to sit down and consider what types of attitudes i want to cultivate , and what pieces of advice i want to give to myself , as i continue my own grown up unschooling these are not so much specifics read more books or take up running , these aren t new year 's resolutions easily made and as easily broken , but instead i hope will act more as my own mini manifesto for the coming year , a year in which i hope i can work on growing , healing , and learning bravely here goes ! my unschooling mug ! society recognize when i m stuck , and don t let myself stay stuck for too long get help when i need it professional help , support from friends , classes , whatever i m not a one person island , and reaching out for support , in whatever way is needed , is a good thing push outside my comfort zone this is one of my biggest goals for this coming year ! as a person with generalized anxiety disorder , pretty much everything is outside my comfort zone , and the longer i stay in my little zone , the smaller it becomes i need to always be expanding it , step by step , little by little , outwards if i want to do better fun is important really important ! it s okay to enjoy something even if it doesn t have an immediate , obvious point quiet times are good in moderation , but a balance needs to be found i love daydreaming and enjoying the small things of everyday life a good cup of coffee , a good cuddle session with my cat , a wonderful new novel however , i can get so wrapped up in them i become isolated other people need to be a regular part of my life , too stop comparing myself to others , and finding myself lacking if i truly believe what i say about each person having their own unique timeline , i can t keep thinking i m at the wrong point on it don t ever be embarrassed to share what i m interested in or excited about , even if or maybe especially if it s something that i know some people would dismiss as unimportant celebrate every tiny little success as if it s a big deal , because it is a big deal ! it s important to recognize progress , whether it s big steps forward or small ones despite what i tell myself , coffee does not actually help me do anything use it in moderation inspiration doesn t usually just pop up all on it s own finding inspiration is work , a deliberate practice of paying attention , doing new things , engaging in conversation with others , and being genuinely thoughtful about what i read and see and hear being brave in my work doesn t only mean talking about my struggles with anxiety and depression , mainly , it also means branching out with my writing , choosing topics that interest me , but i don t know if others will want to read it means creating more things in mediums i haven t explored much before video , audio it means saying yes more to interview requests productivity is a self perpetuating cycle while it s okay to not be productive sometimes , and my value as a human being is not attached to my productivity , when i do more , i feel better and when i feel better , i do more once the ball starts rolling , i have to keep it rolling , even when things are hard doing only a little bit feels a whole lot better than doing nothing if you choose to join in and write your own mini manifestos , please share the links in the comments i d love to read them ! like what you see ? consider supporting me on patreon !
