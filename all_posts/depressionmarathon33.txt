sometimes i have difficulty writing here i want so badly to be a voice of hope for all of us who struggle with this damn illness , severe and persistent depression but sometimes my hope is limited and sometimes it 's nonexistent well , we 're approaching nonexistence , my friends life , right now , is hard my mood has continued to decline since i left the hospital days ago it 's getting quite painful , devastatingly painful the financial stress of my back injury surgery recovery is mounting , which has certainly not helped my mood but my mood my mood is so low i'm really struggling i'm tearful and slow and hurting thoughts of suicide which i rarely write about here are ever present no , i do n't think it 's a good solution , but the thoughts are relentless , nonetheless the thoughts do n't help my mood either i'm not finding much to help my mood right now despite the pain , i'm doing what i can i'm still walking , riding , and doing my exercises i 've kept up with my household chores for the most part i even worked for just over an hour yesterday that 's not going to pay my mortgage , but it was better than nothing , and it got me out of my house i'm going to my tms appointments trying to hold onto the slimmest of hope that tms will work its magic again but when ? when ? ! ! soon , i hope i hope
