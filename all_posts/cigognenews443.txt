in my writings i have emphasized that early experience can deplete supplies of pain killing chemicals that we produce , such as serotonin and then we need to take medication that enhances supplies , medication found in many tranquilizers now there is a study of this in the journal of biological psychiatry sept , here is one thing they found reduced levels of serotonin make us more prone to aggression something i have discussed for over thirty years in other words , serotonin helps regulate serious emotions , especially those that can cause harm and when there is very early trauma or adversity in the womb and at birth our ability to control our impulses is compromised , because our systems over a long time have evolved in order to keep anti social impulses under control otherwise we would all go around killing each other still it seems like all too many go around killing those , in my opinion , had very early trauma and neglect , and have diminished repressive capacities their brains are deficient it might not show up for decades but they will be a danger what the research showed was that low brain serotonin made communication between certain areas of the brain more tenuous not any area of the brain but specifically in those areas dealing with feeling not just the feeling centers but their connections to the top level control centers , the prefrontal cortex so here we have confirmation that when there is diminished serotonin the prefrontal area has a much tougher time to control feelings the researchers discuss the emotion of anger but i am certain that it applies to many of the deepest feelings we have , whether terror , hopelessness or helplessness one way we know this is that we prescribe tranquilizers for depression , which has at is base both hopelessness and helplessness when we suppress those feelings we tend to feel better and when a carrying mother feels depressed there is a good chance that the offspring will also have a tendency to those feelings , as well it all depends on later life experience we see again how the top level thinking area and feelings work in see saw fashion so that the very active top level cortex can control the lower level emotions or not that is , when the top level is compromised the control evaporates and we have an impulsive individual and we may have a criminal or someone who takes risk when he shouldn t or we have a volatile husband who beats his wife and so they go to a counselor who encourages him to control himself anger management but the cortex cannot manage the fury that lies sequestered just below the surface and no counseling will ever , ever , change that exhortation does soup up the prefrontal area a bit , and in so doing arrays the forces of thought and belief against feelings , but that is at best ephemeral the faulty equation between feelings and control centers still exists and will continue to exist and obviously , we must address that equation and normalize it , which can be done no amount of talk and encouragement will achieve that that is the trouble with anger management feelings were never evolved to be managed they exist to be expressed and now the investigators concoct a new nomenclature for this intermittent explosive disorder now officially known as ied isn t that the same as blowing up every now and then ? again , we are trying to ape medical diagnosis , while the inventor of this new diagnosis bathes in glory oh my , that love of diagnosis with fancy sounding names that does nothing to enhance science but the behavior cognitivists hold sway today and so they continue to add this behavior or that to a long list of so called neuroses and they believe that behavior is indicative of neurosis , rather than what drives it it is as if there is no unconscious everything for them is observable they believe only what they can see when most neuroses are hidden and not observable can we see depression ? can we see anguish ? can we see rejection internally ? these are not single behaviors they are systemic problems that affect the whole system the real culprit here is the psychiatric diagnosis manual , which has as many pages and afflictions as the manhattan telephone book it is that thick because the behaviorists control all this when professionals limit themselves to the here and now they have eliminated the time and epoch where and when they could understand origins and generating sources they have cut away the elements that could offer understanding and who suffers ? the patient
