it was a bittersweet day today i had the day off , and i was very productive i went for a chilly , but sunny , good seven mile run this morning i ran a bunch of errands and got some stuff done around the house then , in the early afternoon , i travelled to the vet clinic and picked up puck 's ashes dawn , one of the veterinary assistants retrieved puck 's ashes for me she also gave me a blanket it was the blanket i had puck wrapped in before he died i left it wrapped around him after he was gone i did n't really care if i ever saw it again , but now that i have it back , it 's kind of nice i left the clinic with puck 's ashes and his blanket and drove home at home i opened the wooden box in which puck 's ashes were contained it was odd i 've seen ashes before , so i knew what to expect , but the site of puck 's ashes made me cry i took the plastic bag filled with his ashes out of the box and hugged it to my chest i cried i talked to my boy i cried some more it was really hard to pull the ashes away from my chest and put them back in the box eventually i returned his ashes to the box , closed the box , and placed it on the shelf in front of puck 's photo i set puck 's paw print on top of the box once i put everything back together on the shelf , i felt at peace i laid down on the sofa , hugged puck 's blanket to my chest and fell asleep it 's so nice to have puck home i feel better now that we 're back together again
