study of jade is the first of two paintings of jade that i am working on this little piece is x , oil on canvas a study , to me , is just that i study the face of the subject and create an intimate portrait of the individual i have painted myself and friends in this manner before but will have no hesitation tin approaching people in newfoundland to pose quickly for a little study i want to paint weather beaten faces as well as unblemished babies' skin as well what never fails to amaze me is how duplicitous paint can be when you lay down a swatch of pigment and are satisfied with its value and colour , you might return days later when it has had time to dry a bit and it looks different it looks incorrect whether this is due to the paint drying or simple observational error is one that i struggle with and must go and reassess the area in question and reapply the colour i should not gripe because that is the nature of what i do but it is vexing ! this painting took about painting sessions of hours each i would say the wonderful thing about studies is that they are a way of getting to know the subject i enjoy studying the planes of their faces and examining the nuances that typical , casual observation might miss it 's like a little window into the person and i cherish these little studies as much , if not more , than larger scale pieces art , like morality , consists of drawing the line somewhere g k chesterton
