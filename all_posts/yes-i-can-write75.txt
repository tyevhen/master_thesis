mostly what i write is aimed at unschoolers themselves unschooling parents , teens , and grown unschoolers , and potential unschoolers those new to unschooling but what about the people for whom unschooling , as in the practice of not going to elementary or high school and instead learning from life , is no longer an option , just because they ve already finished with high school sometimes quite a while ago ? for the schooled adults who discover unschooling and love what they see , and want to know how they can incorporate the ideas ideals of unschooling into their own lives , this is the post for you not being a schooled adult , i can t swear this is the best advice for someone who was , but here are some things i think have the potential to make a difference in the way people approach learning in their own lives forget everything you know about what is and isn t educational most adults have a pretty set idea of what things are educational things taught in school and which things aren t things done for fun or leisure , aka things not taught in school learning is everywhere , if you re looking for it , and there s nothing that s not worth your time to learn , as long as you want to be learning it ! spend your time learning about whatever you re curious or passionate about , whether or not it seems particularly useful or educational let go of any ideas you have about what the structure of learning is supposed to look like if you genuinely thrive on learning in a really structured and organized way , then go ahead and create your ideal curriculum , complete with scheduled study time for the next few months but you can also just pick up a few books from the library to read whenever you feel like it , or spend time googling a subject in free moments between other commitments , or drop in to a local music jam whenever you want some help practicing learning can be as rigorous and structured or as relaxed and casual as you wish to make it learning doesn t have to be pursued in a way that looks like school for it to be worthwhile i'm thinking of trying to find a fiddle teacher , after wanting to play for many years learning by myself is n't going as well as i 'd hoped ! learn to relax there are times when unschoolers face the pressure to perform well , for sure auditions and job interviews and university entrance exams but for the most part , the meat of learning is done without someone looking critically over your shoulder , without the looming presence of quizzes and exams learning can be strictly for you , simply because you want to learn take a deep breath relax learning for the sake of learning can be really fun and exciting and rewarding there s no end date to learning i am learning all the time the tombstone will be my diploma eartha kitt there s a reason that quote has lived at the top of my blog for years its message resonates with me , and reminds me that it s never too late to learn something you re not too old to learn x instrument , or to decide to memorize the times tables , or learn anything else that you re supposed to learn young for as long as you re alive , you can keep on learning any damn thing you want to all of these are important things to remember , for schooled people and unschoolers alike i can get caught up in other peoples' expectations of what learning is , too but the secret , if there is one , comes down to just working on eroding the imaginary line between living and learning life learning is what it 's all about what is your advice for adults wanting to incorporate unschooling ideals into their lives ? what have you felt was helpful in your own life ?
