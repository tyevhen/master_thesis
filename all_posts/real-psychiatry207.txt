a recent opinion piece in the new york times , by george makari , md has me shaking my head the thesis was that a recent headline grabbing story what 's wrong with that criteria ? on the effects of comprehensive treatment of psychosis as opposed to treatment as usual surprised many and highlighted the problem with reductionism he bemoans the fact that the reaction to the story was one of surprise he does n't specify who was surprised i certainly was not surprised i attended recent meeting and somebody in the audience asked daniel weinberger if he was surprised his response they spent million dollars showing that good treatment is better than bad treatment he certainly was not surprised i have not heard about eric kandel 's response , but based on his paper on plasticity and what happens in psychotherapy i doubt that he would be surprised the exact population of who might be surprised by these findings seems poorly defined at this point in time but i doubt that it included any psychiatrists speaking for myself , i will elaborate on why i was not be surprised at one point , i was the medical director of a community support program of a group of about outpatients in the state of wisconsin according to the state statutes , access to the program depended on diagnosis and degree of psychiatric disability you could only apply if you had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder , major depression , schizophrenia , or borderline personality disorder had significant associated disability or were at high risk for hospitalization the clinical goal of the program was to reduce hospitalizations , maintain independent living , and facilitate employment the program was staffed by a psychologist , social workers , three nurses and me when i arrived , one of the early dynamics was to frame problems in terms of medication needs that translated to increasing the dose of a medication typically an antidepressant or antipsychotic in crisis situations or other emotional crises the patients in the program had chronic problems and symptoms that did not necessarily respond to medication one of my first steps was to start to discuss problems and solutions with the patients i met with all of the patients and did supportive psychotherapy when possible we had team meetings every morning and problem solved around the needs of the patients in the community , how to solve any crises , and how to approach people in ways other than medications i tracked the total dose of antipsychotic medication and days of hospitalization as outcome measures at the end of three years , the days in hospital had gone down from about days per person to less than , and the total dose of antipsychotic medication had gone down a total of mg chlorpromazine equivalents my point is obviously that comprehensive care of patients with severe problems results in improved outcomes in this case lower doses of medications were used and the patients spent less time in the hospital and more time at home my orientation and ability to implement such a program was not an accident i was trained by len stein , md at the university of wisconsin dr stein was a pioneer in the area defined as community psychiatry he was motivated by realizing that once people were in large state hospitals it was very easy to warehouse them in overcrowded conditions nobody seems to recognize it but overcrowding and suboptimal conditions were the state hospital equivalent of managed care rationing once your state hospital is on the spreadsheet of a state bean counter with no accountability to patients or their families rationing and fewer and fewer resources are the order of the day in a community psychiatry seminar , dr stein projected a slide of a gymnasium sized room populated by male patients with hundreds of cots aligned edge to edge there was no room to walk between the cots that was his motivation for moving people out of these state facilities and into their own housing when i trained , there were three programs with independent living and quality of life as the primary goals and the staff involved in the programs was very good at it my effort just extended that skill set contrary to the surprising results of the quoted study i did the same thing back in ! if it is true that we have known for years that comprehensive care for psychiatric disorders trumps treatment as usual what is all of the rhetoric about ? dr makari seems to want to make this into a mind brain argument in other words , the biopsychosocial approach and the uncertain effect it has on the mind as opposed to a brain based approach that looks at specific mechanisms of action and seems to be focused on psychopharmacology he points out for example that the highlighted study would possible not qualify for current nimh funding unless it looked at specific brain mechanisms he throws around the word reductionism anytime reductionistic or reductionism is used rhetorically in the same sentence with psychiatry it is pejorative my old psychoanalytic teacher would refer to anyone who talked about brain biology as a dial twister the implication is that the reductionists are somewhat simple minded largely because they cannot accept the uncertainty of dealing with an organ that has poorly defined inputs and outputs kind of a double whammy of rhetoric you are a unsophisticated reductionist and you really ca n't see the big picture are things really that simple ? are these arguments accurate ? are there problems with equating reductionism with bad of course there are major problems the first is the statement that inherent to the proposition that mental illness is a brain disease is the implication that psychological and social events somehow are not also brain events this is a serious misreading of the definition of plasticity or experience dependent changes in the brain when i give my neurobiology of the brain lectures i use kandel 's original new england journal of medicine article that discusses brain changes in a patient and a therapist conducting psychotherapy and how those changes are associated with brain plasticity i give further examples weightlifting , playing the violin , and how the typical stream of consciousness is profoundly altered by drug addiction there is no neuroscientist or biological psychiatrist i know who would suggest that psychological and social events are not brain events and there are numerous experimental paradigms that look specifically at how these events occur in the brains of animals the second aspect of dr makari 's argument has to do with reductionism his specific comment is with luck , studies like dr kane s , which undermine these suppositions , will help move us away from such narrow thinking and embolden the substantial community within psychiatry that has never accepted such reductionism the suppositions in this case are that mental illness is a brain disease and that social or psychological events have no brain representation the argument is based on that false premise but further the use of the term reductionism is instructive here as previously noted by definition reductionism applies to many proposed etiologies of psychiatric disorders those etiologies can be studied at a molecular level or at a higher level schaffer says that a model is reductive if it employs standard biochemical and molecular entities to account for psychiatric symptoms and disorders non reductive models discuss causal connections at higher levels of aggregation he illustrates these definitions by looking at kendler 's non reductive account of major depression kendler has used path analysis to look at clinical variables relevant to psychiatric disorders and although i do not have access to the one used in the book , here is a typical example the model looks at life stages , familial factors and psychological factors and all are higher levels of aggregation than molecular mechanisms at the reductive side of things he examines harrison and weinberger 's proposed genetic susceptibility genes for schizophrenia at the time the book was written the author limited the discussion to genes he also looked at the continuum of psychiatric genetic models ranging from basic and advanced genetic epidemiology being non reductive , gene finding partially reductive , and molecular genetics fully reductive it seems perfectly logical to me that the study of brain biology proceeds in the same way that the biology of all living organisms proceeds the difference is that we are studying an infinitely more plastic organ with significant computational power there is clearly a lot of phenotypic heterogeneity that is unexplained in psychiatric diagnostic categories it is highly unlikely that refining diagnostic descriptors or applying clinical methods will lead to any significant change in the diagnostic or treatment process i do n't understand the reluctance to go after more specific mechanisms or treatments the idea that a molecular or clinical focus in psychiatry is the problem with psychiatric services is also misleading as i hoped to point out by my mental health center example , psychiatrists know all about comprehensive care but they are rarely able to provide it they have known about how to provide it for decades state asylums became overcrowded and not therapeutic due to the financial management of the system by state governments the bean counters have moved out of the asylum and they are now integrated at every level in the health care system they all have a very strong bias against the comprehensive treatment of mental illness they insist that patients with severe psychiatric problems do not get comprehensive evaluations , that they are discharged before they have been adequately treated , and that any associated addictions are poorly treated they do not have the same biases against people hospitalized for medical or surgical illnesses they have in effect , moved the poorly run , overcrowded asylum model into the general health care system any comprehensive care for severe mental disorders in such a system is an advertising phenomenon rather than reality the reductionism argument is good for new york times opinion pieces it may sell a few more papers or get a few more clicks online unfortunately it perpetuates an old pattern of blaming people and psychiatrists in particular for the shortcomings of a non system of mental health care in this country that is set up to favor large health care businesses you can blame psychiatrists all you want for that but until people realize that the real problems are the product of business and politics and not the scientific interests of psychiatrists
