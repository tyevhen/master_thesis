driving home tonight , a minute drag of a drive , i could n't put my finger on it something was different hmmm what was it ? my car was the same old saturn i 've driven for the past years the road was the same boring , flat , rural strip the radio was blaring the same , hip , yuppie station but something was different suddenly , it dawned on me it was the yawning the yawning , or more specifically the lack of yawning , that was the difference ! i was n't yawning i was n't slipping on the precipice of consciousness rather than bobbing up and down , my head was still that was it ! i was n't tired ! not being tired is such big news in my world , i had to tell you i was exhausted yesterday i was tired the day before that but today , i'm not tired is it too much to hope that this will last ? could this be a new trend ? maybe that new med is making a difference maybe it 's the c pap machine i 've worn each recent night maybe , maybe , maybe maybe i 'll stop worrying about why , and when , and how long and just enjoy this moment of relative normalcy hmmm normal so this is what it feels like
