i'm feeling tired i'm not sure if it 's due to the hard race this past weekend , or if it 's the result of many busy days in a row after racing hard on saturday , i worked hours and swam minutes on sunday , and then i worked a full day again monday i'm typing here right now because i could n't quite get out of bed for my strength training class this morning unfortunately , puck got me up within minutes anyway , so i would have been better off getting my butt to the gym i did get my speed workout in yesterday , but much of the rest of the day was spent lounging or sleeping on the sofa i'm not panicking , just observing it makes sense to me that i'm tired i just do n't care much for the feeling i'm smack in the middle of marathon training , so tired is a normal state of being at this time i'm scheduled to run my first miler this week , and i may do that tomorrow i may do it thursday because there is a k race i 'd like to run on saturday maybe that 's dumb , or too much , but if the weather is decent , it 's a fun race if the weather is crappy , i 'll likely skip it anyway , i'm going to be running no matter what i found out my official results from saturday 's race i was a little surprised despite my disappointing time , i finished th of women in my age division i was the st woman overall , and i think there were around women in the race both results made me feel a little better about my effort well , i need to wake up now and get ready for work a second cup of coffee is calling my name my body is tired , but my mood remains stable and good i'm very grateful for that have a great day !
