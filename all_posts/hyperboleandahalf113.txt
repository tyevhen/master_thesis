sarah can i just say how amused i am that after all that your mom completely breezed past the part of the story where you poisoned yourself to compliment you on the fact that you are a gifted humorist and writer ? shaky jake i'm high on nougat right now , and that does n't even require a prescription anonymous i 'd like to tell you a short story almost two years ago , i a girl who grew up with pet dogs and was certainly not a cat person took in a cat that had grown up in the wild from a kitten he was at least years old at the time , and i had slowly gotten him used to me and only me and fed him and cared for him outside and all then one morning i woke up to find him on the front doorstep , hardly able to breathe i miracle of miracles somehow managed to get him to the vet , and he was made all better now at that point , it was the middle of winter he could n't stay outside with breathing problems so he became an inside cat side note he ca n't meow the most he can muster is a whispery meh it 's precious so he 's been an inside cat for two years now , and you ca n't even tell he was ever outside , he 's so spoiled he weighs like pounds , i swear anyway , i was never able to think of a good name for him nothing i tried fit him at all so for two years , he 's answered to kitty this is embarrassing when relating funny stories , to admit that my cat is called kitty i tried to pretend that i named him after sully in monsters , inc because boo called him kitty , but i think we can all agree that was a pretty thin cover , and everyone thinks i'm just a retard who ca n't think of what to name her cat my point here , allie , is that after two long years , your ad blog named my cat ! seriously i clicked on an ad to help you out , and found a good cat names quiz and i answered all the questions truthfully and it told me to name him charlemagne , which is a horrible name , so i took it again with less truthful honest answers , and it said sebastian ! which normally is not a great name but it totally fits him so thank you , allie , for making an ad blog and naming my cat ! the end angryredhead i think we should ban the french language entirely , as it obviously makes no sense at all jamie i am less offended by your post than i am by the fact i have to tell people my daughter has assburgers that dude should have changed his name to something french how very selfish of you to go have experiences and leave us here without new posts caitlin glad you did n't die then someone says why are you yelling and then the other person say i don't know or i'm not yelling and then person one says yes you are ! and then person two says well i'm sorry , i can't help it and then that continues on for like another five minutes canoncowgirl the whole time i 've been reading your blog all a couple weeks or so i 've been confusing hyperbole and perabola which is dumb because if anything i should be confusing hyperbole and hyperbola but i was totally imagining a single arch and a half none of that top and bottom mirror arch crap so apparently i'm not only confused regaurding the english language but also on geometry terms tia repulser rhymes with ulcer you know , like as in his job was to be the repulser so no one would bother the lions ok maybe it 's not a word kaitlyn way to wreck a productive afternoon and give me arachnoiditis rikki fuck jeans sorry i said fuck i am totally following your bad example , but , to everyone 's relief , i do n't hate you ohsweetsara so i'm going to go ahead and freak out the people who follow me on twitter to help you with your cause if this makes them stop following me it will be totally worth it because i only started following them because they were following me and i felt obligated , but i'm too nice to un follow them because twitter is a dick head and tells people when someone stops following them , and i don t want to be that person but their tweets are really annoying and about cat food coupons and i do n't even have a cat so i do n't care , but if they stop following me because i tweeted ' mandatorysexparty' then that would be awesome , and i would totally want to give you a prize ellie you ate all the cookies ? now i want cookies i have cookie dough in the freezer , but that would mean defrosting is necessary the complexity of life is overwhelming lizard dot lizard ok this is off topic in that it does n't relate to your eventual point , but , the bird thing ? is there something weird going on with the birds ? last week about four different sparrows committed kamikaze on the windows at work and they 're not even clear ! and today there was a dead finch by the window , and then later thwack ! a quail we do n't even have quail around where i work some quail flew however many miles , just to fling himself against the window and die ! i have pictures to prove it so what 's up with the birds ? is this an attack , or a desperate sort of warning in which they 're sacrificing their little birdie lives to tell us hey ! hey ! you in there ! watch out ! watch out for what ? stephanie if it were me ? i would have let people think i had cancer and then milked the sympathy boyfriend situation for all it was worth apparently my adolescent self was not too proud for pity dating sherri and you got to visit a meth lab no fair nicole thank you for your letter to cosmo if one more issue tells me to use ice cubs on my partner , i am going to eh i have no real repercussions that chick my best friend would come up to me and say , dear , you 're awful angry is your uterus leaking ? josh gard as a regular guy who can appreciate a cute though slightly odd girl , i can say that allie pulls off the sexy lion much better than a lot of girls could ! alice i was asleep on an apple green vintage couch on a busy street , inexplicably wearing fairy wings true story moving sucks kaloo but this makes no sense everyone knows that scissors stab eyes and without eyes rock is going to miss horribly duncan aka boyfriend at least we can all agree paper sucks in any situation nikole are you people kidding ? have you never been cut by paper ? it is the most excruciating ordeals one could possibly experience i assume even moreso than natural childbirth my brother 's girlfriend once told me that my mom was sandy confused , i yelled , no , her name is jeanne ! in the middle of baskin robbins apparently she meant that my mom had a sandy vagina figuratively speaking because who would n't be irritable with sand in the vag ? seriously , think about the mechanics of chaffing basically , she was calling my mom a bitch but how was i to know sandy could be used as that kind of a descriptor ? my cousin roommate loves milk an unnatural amount erin can we be best friends ?

i was wondering if you also found this to be disturbing laurel kornfield i cannot tell if she is being serious or if she 's just the funniest person ever pluto is still a planet only four percent of the iau voted on the controversial demotion , and most are not planetary scientists their decision was immediately opposed in a formal petition by hundreds of professional astronomers led by dr alan stern , principal investigator of nasa s new horizons mission to pluto one reason the iau definition makes no sense is it says dwarf planets are not planets at all ! that is like saying a grizzly bear is not a bear , and it is inconsistent with the use of the term dwarf in astronomy , where dwarf stars are still stars , and dwarf galaxies are still galaxies also , the iau definition classifies objects solely by where they are while ignoring what they are if earth were in pluto s orbit , according to the iau definition , it would not be a planet either a definition that takes the same object and makes it a planet in one location and not a planet in another is essentially useless pluto is a planet because it is spherical , meaning it is large enough to be pulled into a round shape by its own gravity a state known as hydrostatic equilibrium and characteristic of planets , not of shapeless asteroids held together by chemical bonds these reasons are why many astronomers , lay people , and educators are either ignoring the demotion entirely or working to get it overturned sy it 's like a cat yeah you can dress it up and parade it down the street , but if you the power giver does n't feed it , it is just a worthless lump fine , you have to bury the cat , or at least make a nice stew out of it , but regardless the effort to feed it once in a while makes you awesome and the appliance weak thank you for making me laugh so hard every day p s my no internet debacle is no excuse for the fact that i have been terribly tardy with the prizes that i owe some of you if i owe you , please email me with the password , and your request contact button at top of sidebar alternatively , ickybana hotmail com i may even surprise you with something extra do n't count on it , but maybe
