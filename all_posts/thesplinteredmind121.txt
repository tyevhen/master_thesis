sometimes explaining our troubles can sound like whining to people who do not share our burdens moments before my friend whisked me away to a night of distraction two weekends ago , i jotted down some quick notes my weekend had been hard i recorded and produced an album for nine hours on that saturday , then began ticking early the next day the ticking lasted for over thirty six hours in addition to that , my hard drive had burped and lost gigabytes of data a few days before no utilities i ran could resurrect the data it was gone a weekend of deep digging yielded no results bad block city had rezoned my drive with the last attempt a colossal failure , i could officially sink into blackness depression was settling in not just because i lost data , but because i was drained and lacking the energy to fight it off then again , i could go catch an action adventure flick with lots of mindless explosions and violence instead of sinking into despair guess which option won out ? nothing kicks depression in the fanny like a good bruce willis flick so , what does this have to do with whining ? well , i had a bad weekend it was hard i had to fight off depression it was really hard my computer was mean to me did i mention i had a hard time ? and do you care ? let 's be honest you probably do n't you have your own problems , and if you do n't suffer from depression you ca n't quite understand why seemingly insignificant events can trigger a battle with deep sadness obviously , losing gigabytes of data is by no means insignificant , but should it usher in crushing depression ? it 's a bummer to be sure , but it 's not the end of the world there was a time when i would write about my bad luck oh , i tried to be funny about it , but it just sounded like whining in the end maybe the experiences were too close to my heart maybe the wounds were still open and raw i could n't step back far enough to skewer them with wit there is also the possibility that we cannot complain about injustice without sounding a bit whiny to those who could n't care less about our personal turmoil i have found that others experience this same problem i 've been getting a lot of hits lately from a blog called beyond blue over at beliefnet the articles are frequent , well written , and i'm terribly jealous of the author how does she find the time to write so much ? and look at all the comments her approach to depression is similar to mine with a fair amount of cognitive behavior therapy , though she embraces meds a path that is not open for me she sings the comforting song that sometimes there 's nothing you can do about depression it just hurts and people love her then i read this blog of hers on how people just do n't get it when i finished her blog i said to myself , whine , whine , whine that 's all non depressives hear when we try to explain our burden i was amazed she sounded like she was whining i sounded like i was whining and there was nothing we could do about it because we cannot force people to care some will simply never get it , and frankly , we should be thankful for that depression is a terrible burden and i would n't wish it on my worst enemy well , maybe i 'd wish it on them for a weekend or two i feel the same way about my other disabilities only those who have them truly understand them this is why i changed the focus of my blog from writing about the problems i had to writing about the strategies i use to cope with them it is a policy that has worked well for me and has reached more people , though those who wallow in their misery lost interest in me regardless , not only have i met many wonderful people through this blog , i have become a better and more well minded individual although some people have accused me of not really having depression or ad hd because my life is not a medication filled blackened cesspit like theirs , i just laugh at them now if only they knew what a mess my world really was because of these disabilities , but if i went into too much detail you might think i was whining tags technorati adhd blogging depression cognitive behavior therapy fun distractions mind over mood musings like reading the splintered mind ? share articles with your friends , link from your blog , or subscribe !
