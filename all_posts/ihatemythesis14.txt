when the task of writing a thesis grows from a discrete event into a lifestyle , the socially inclined grad student must adjust his or her habits to accommodate this burden sometimes that involves taking your laptop to the bar ironically , i found it no less distracting than the oh so studious coffee shop and as an added bonus , the alcohol takes the edge off the academic anxiety one word of advice bar studying should only be done sunday thru tuesday nights so as not to disturb the bar goers who actually have lives and want to have fun ps i do n't care how starving a student you are tip your barstaff !
