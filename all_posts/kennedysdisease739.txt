sma news today published an interesting article perhaps another opportunity for us living with kennedy 's disease int gene therapy for neurodegenerative diseases granted priority patent status the patent application for gene therapy candidate int , developed by vybion for the treatment of huntington s disease , spinal muscular atrophy sma , and other neurodegenerative diseases , was granted track one status from the u s patent and trademark office uspto the patent application covers the treatment s composition and methods of use the track one designation gives the application priority review , allowing it to get a final decision within about a year track one has fewer requirements and doesn t need a pre examination search for the application vybion is pleased to receive track status on int and anticipates rapid review and allowance , vybion ceo lee henderson said in a press release int gene therapy was specifically designed to target neurologic diseases caused by polyq expansions , resulting in mutant proteins that accumulate in motor neurons and subsequently lead to cellular degeneration the gene therapy aims to detect and target the toxic sequence , promoting its degradation and thereby preventing its accumulation in neuronal cells int is considered a potential therapeutic strategy for other neurodegenerative diseases with similar biological features , such as spinal cerebellar ataxia , alzheimer s disease , and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy sbma however , the treatment has so far been more fully developed for huntington s , according to vybion s drug pipeline , and more studies are required to validate its effectiveness and safety for it and other neurodegenerative conditions to read the entire article click on the title above for those that want to read the actual study , follow this link journal of neurodegnerative diseases
