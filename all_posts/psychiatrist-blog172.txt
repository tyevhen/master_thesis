there 's a great essay in the new york times that i'm sure you 'll like it 's written by michael hedrick , a journalist photographer who discusses the difficult time he had in the year after he was diagnosed with schizophrenia tormented by his symptoms , he spent his days at work and his evening drinking and smoking pot , until he lost his job then landed in court with a dwi charge mandated to treatment for substance abuse and drug testing , hedrick writes in living with schizophrenia the importance of routine maybe it was the shock of meeting with a d u i lawyer , or the point after sentencing when i realized i d be forced to make a daily call , first thing in the morning , to find out if i would have to pee in a cup that day maybe it was the fact that i d need someone else , mainly my mom , to drive me anywhere for the next year or perhaps it was the consistent saturday morning drug and alcohol therapy group or wednesday and thursday afternoons of community service that kicked me into a groove the groove of it eventually turned into a routine , one that wasn t marked by indulgence but instead by forced commitment that eventually i would grow to respect during that time , i quit smoking pot , i quit drinking and i got some of the best sleep i d gotten since my diagnosis trips to the bar on monday afternoons turned into extended hours at coffee shops where i finished my first novel for some reason , it gave me joy to recite my routine to whoever asked i would wake up at , get coffee and a bagel with plain cream cheese , check facebook , write until i had , words , get lunch , do errands in the afternoon , return home , get dinner , take my pills with food , watch tv and get to bed around it might all sound tremendously boring but this regimented series of events was always there they d always carry over and with time , it gave me great comfort to not have to deal with the unexpected i had a set plan for most days , and there was already too much chaos in my head maybe it 's not just for people with schizophrenia or for people with substance abuse problems routine is comforting to all of us , and clean living helps i almost missed this one and i'm glad i did n't , it 's was worth passing along
