guess who has been posting somewhat regularly crickets me , i have i know this sounds stupid , but i am pretty proud of myself i went from once or twice a month to almost everyday that 's what i call progress , but at the same time i am thinking maybe it was better when i only posted once a month because then you guys could n't get sick of me now maybe it 's too much , maybe i am annoying you falls into a pit of second guessing and anxiety okay on to the review , so i love retellings i am sure i 've mentioned this before i also happen to like twisted and darker retellings , i am morbid like that so when i saw this sitting on a shelf , i snatched it up synopsis i did n't ask for any of this i did n't ask to be some kind of hero but when your whole life gets swept up by a tornado taking you with it you have no choice but to go along , you know ? i had heard mostly good things about it , and though i have never read the original , 'oz' , and i was never fond of the movie the witch scared me to death when i was four , and i hate musicals i did like the new movie that just came out , with james franco , but i forget it 's name i decided that this looked like a book i would enjoy , i mean dorthy needs to die , count me in i read it in about a day , which is a usual thing for me and it flowed nicely , the writer knows her stuff and i have to give her props for a great idea the world is dark and twisted just like i was expecting everything is upside down , so you guessed it , all the character 's that you know as good are evil , and all the evil character 's are somewhat good wicked is good , i think amy actually says this at some point in the book , which was a little too 'maze runner' for me i liked amy , she grew up in a trailer park with a alcoholic mother , and despite her insecurities she makes for a strong protagonist , who shows a lot of gumption in some pretty scary situations the only thing that bothered me about her was her potty mouth , and i figure it was to add realism , but i do n't see any reason why young adult novels need to be spewing the f word i like pete , he was the one character i really liked , he was n't in the book much , but he seemed to really want to help amy i also loved , loved that there was no love triangle , thank you danielle paige i am worried that there might be in the second one though i also really enjoyed how the evil character 's were n't evil for evil 's sake and how it was explained how they all became that way i did like nox , but he came off as arrogant , and i know he is supposed to be like the bad boy type and that 's their thing , but i really did n't like him as much as i should 've i also felt that him and amy and zero chemistry , i mean they verbally and physically spared for the whole , book i knew amy liked him , but ca n't remember him doing anything to show that he actually liked her so when they kissed , i literally could n't have cared less my biggest problem was nothing surprised me in this book , everything happened more or less how i assumed it would i do want to say that i think danielle paige is a great writer , and i will be reading the second one so that 's something i guess i liked this book , but i did n't love it i would give it three stars pros evil dorthy good female protagonist no love triangle creepy version of oz cons swearing violence does n't bother me , but it might bother some people
