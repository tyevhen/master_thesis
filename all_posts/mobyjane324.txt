to continue the post from yesterday i went out to do the gardening for the morning , carrying with me some left over physical symptoms of the earlier depression that had n't subsided completely , although the edge was off it was heavy work i was digging trenches around my avocado trees to catch more water since rain is due sunday and the trees are on a hill i figure the more water i can retain from the rain , the less water i have to use to irrigate by hard work i mean i was huffing and puffing when my hour was up and i came back in to prepare for my swim there were no physical symptoms from the earlier depression no pressure in the chest , no trouble with breathing i was absolutely fine i was absolutely happy it seems so strange to have depression come down and zap me into this really terrible place and then , with absolutely nothing in my life changing , just by my getting to work and picking up my daily routine , the depression completely goes away the rest of the day was fine , my evening was wonderful and i woke up around am and there was the black cloak thrown over me again despair , a black sense of futility , nothing 's worth anything it 's so painful and yet i am able to keep a sense of awareness that this may not be present reality , this is just depression , remember , i can get rid of it all those things are true and yet the feeling is so pervasive that i ca n't talk myself out of it immediately no matter how much i tell myself that it 's just depression , it still hurts i have to really turn my thinking completely away from it i do the brainswitching exercises a couple of times i had to tell myself do you want to think or do you want to sleep i did go back to sleep with the counting exercises and got up at am the depression was still there but fainter i did some singing to myself as i dressed and went out to garden ten minutes after being outside i realized that , again , i was okay talk about hour cycles ! at night i always feel so wonderful i ca n't believe how bad i felt in the morning i can remember feeling bad , but i ca n't call back the actual agonizing feeling it 's my experience that it is impossible to feel bad on purpose maybe i could get there , as an experiment , if i did a lot of negative thinking but the habit is so ingrained in me to immediately stop negative thinking , thinking about things going wrong , or worrying about something i just do n't want to do that kind of experiment maybe it 's like the hippocratic oath , first , do no harm the pattern is always the same i 'll go to sleep and almost always wake up depressed but the exercises always work even when i'm depressed i still think i'm in charge and so depression has no fear for me even though the feeling is fearful and agonizing i can still separate out me from how i feel a b curtiss
