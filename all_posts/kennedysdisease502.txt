week of today i finished my twice a day anti clotting drug shots i will not miss this morning and evening ritual and my wife won t either my stomach looks like a black and blue pin cushion and , my left hand has pinholes on every finger the pinholes will continue as they test me twice a week until i stabilize at the new desired anticoagulation level the warfarin dosage is still being tweaked to find the right level somewhere between to the times a week blood test will help monitor where i am at and also let me know when it is time to increase or decrease the warfarin level i feel i am getting to know the doctor s office staff too well my once a year visit has turned into five in two weeks and growing this is a trend that is not conducive to my feeling of being a healthy and happy person i know it is hard to believe , but my daily exercise routine that has been so effective over the last couple of years has increased with the addition of several calf exercises i have incorporated these exercises into my morning routine as well as performing these calf exercises every hours exercise appears to help keep the calf muscles loose and the pain minimized i had never really considered blood clots before a sister and brother had them , and my mother in law has them also it is now another thing for me to consider as my mobility declines i have already changed a few of my routines to ensure that i keep the blood flowing through my legs all day i now have adopted a new saying just keep moving
