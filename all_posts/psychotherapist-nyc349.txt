generally speaking , as a psychotherapist , i recommend step meetings , especially during the early stage of recovery but i also know that for many people , especially people who have a history of emotional trauma , going to step meetings can be too overwhelming during the initial stage of recovery early stage of recovery what to do if step meetings are too overwhelming for you steps meetings have saved many lives the steps , which are principals for living life , provide a structured step by step philosophy that many people describe as having been life saving for them many of these people struggled in isolation and shame with their addiction before they began attending step meetings but when they began going to meetings , they discovered that they were not alone this provides many people with a sense of comfort and safety step meetings have saved many lives in most step meetings , many people in early recovery can find mutual support among other people who are also struggling with addiction there is also an opportunity to find a sponsor who can help with working through the steps for many people with emotional trauma , step meetings are too overwhelming but there are many other people , who have a history of emotional trauma , who find the meetings to be too overwhelming , especially when they hear stories in the meetings that triggers their trauma when people feel triggered during the early stage of recovery by hearing stories that are overwhelming , they can feel like drinking or drugging or gambling , overeating and so on , depending upon their addiction many people , who get emotionally overwhelmed override their own sense that they are making themselves too emotionally vulnerable to relapse because they feel that there 's something wrong with them if they ca n't tolerate being at the meetings after all , they think to themselves , many people have told them that going to step meetings is good for them so they continue to force themselves to go and continue to get triggered and retraumatized because they 're not ready to hear other people 's traumatic stories in the meeting of course , there are also a multitude of success stories in the meetings about how people have achieved years of sobriety and many stories about hope and transcendence but , for many people with a history of emotional trauma , it only takes one difficult story to overwhelm them and then they relapse they 're just not ready , at that point , to attend step meetings getting triggered is a common experience for people who have been traumatized there is no reason to feel ashamed about this getting triggered is a common experience for people who have been traumatized getting emotionally triggered is a common experience for people who experienced trauma just like a veteran who returns from war can get triggered when he or she hears the backfiring of a car which sounds similar to an war time explosive , anyone who has trauma can get triggered when they 're in particular situations getting help in therapy if you are in the early stage of recovery and you 're finding it too difficult to attend step meetings , you can get help by working with a licensed mental health professional who has expertise in working with clients in early recovery who have a history of emotional trauma an experienced therapist can help you to develop the necessary coping skills to deal with early recovery issues as well as relapse prevention many people who are in the early stage of recovery want to rush into dealing with their trauma before they 're ready they feel that they 've wasted too much time and they want to make up for lost time by rushing into things but usually this is n't a good idea during the early stage you need to learn coping skills and develop internal and external resources before you begin to deal with trauma getting help in therapy once you have developed coping skills and the therapist assesses that you 're ready , then you can begin to work on the underlying emotional trauma being safe , both physically and emotionally , is the first priority about me i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist who works with individuals and couples i am a certified substance abuse professional , and i have worked with many clients who are in recovery to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at or email me josephineolivia aol com
