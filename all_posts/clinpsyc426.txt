in this post , i will discuss statements of a couple academic thought leaders regarding the bolder i study and how these statements compare to the actual evidence cutler dr andrew cutler , one of the authors on the bolder i study to which i referred earlier , had some nice things to say about the study s findings in clinical psychiatry news for example , he said it s a landmark study in addition , the article paraphrased cutler as saying , the study used one dose each evening , and had several other unique features , he noted almost all previous data on treating bipolar depression focus on bipolar i patients , but this study included rapid cyclers and bipolar ii patients what dr cutler failed to note is that seroquel was not more effective than placebo at the end of the eight week trial for bipolar ii patients if cutler is going to introduce bipolar ii participants into the mix , then he has an obligation to mention that treatment was not significantly more effective than placebo for this group he may have been misquoted i don t know but it does read directly like pr for the drug that goes well beyond the findings of the study which he is discussing it is worth noting that cutler runs a private research firm and that it can t hurt his standing among drug companies who hire his firm to run clinical trials when he makes statements such as those mentioned above i found it interesting that on his firm s website , it is mentioned we are also noted for low placebo response how do you get a low placebo response besides not treating participants very well ? i m not making an accusation i am just really curious if placebo response has to do with expectations of getting better and these expectations are influenced by how the study personnel treat participants , then what s the deal ? maybe you can treat participants well and still quash the placebo response i just wish i knew more about how this was done calabrese dr joseph calabrese , bolder i s primary investigator , had the following to say about the study there was a dramatic response within eight days of beginning treatment in patients who were symptomatic with bipolar depression i m not sure if dramatic is the right word looking at figure in the article , i see that after week one , placebo patients seem to have changed by points on the montgomery asberg depression rating scale madrs , while those on seroquel seem to have changed by about points that s an average difference of about points on a rating scale where the average patient had a score of about coming in so is a score of on placebo dramatically different than a score of on medication ? methinks that the language itself is a little dramatic don t get me wrong it s good that the medication was better than placebo after a week but let s not get hyped up beyond what is reasonable it is troubling when academics are willing to make pr statements that go beyond the evidence and , in cutler s statement regarding bipolar ii , are demonstrably false academic thought leaders are frequently featured in news articles , review articles , pr releases , and continuing medical education events making these types of statements that go well beyond the evidence it seems that too few professionals in the mental health arena have picked up on the fact that marketing and science have largely melded into a witches brew in which what is good for a product s sales often trumps the actual data on its efficacy and safety before anyone gets upset because i mentioned people s names here , keep in mind that i m not saying either cutler or calabrese is a bad person i don t know them personally they may well conduct top notch research and possess saintly personalities all i am talking about here is how their remarks seem to differ from the studies that the remarks are based upon , and how such practice is widespread major hat tip depression introspection
