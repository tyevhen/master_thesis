there are several bills before congress that would help to end insurance discrimination against people with mental health problems in addition to hr , there is also sb , hr , and hr here is pete stark 's speech introducing his hr pdf , the medicare mental health modernization act my emphasis added speech of hon fortney pete stark of california in the house of representatives friday , march , mr stark madam speaker , i rise today with my colleagues jim ramstad of minnesota and patrick kennedy from rhode island to introduce the medicare mental health modernization act , a bill to provide mental health parity in medicare i have introduced a version of this bill in every congress since perhaps this time we can actually enact it medicare 's mental health benefit is fashioned on treatments provided in , but mental health care has changed dramatically over the last years medicare limits inpatient coverage at psychiatric hospitals to days over an individual 's lifetime in addition , beneficiaries are charged a discriminatory percent coinsurance for outpatient psychotherapy services , compared to percent for physical health services the medicare mental health modernization act eliminates this blatant mental health discrimination under medicare and modernizes the medicare mental health benefit to meet today 's standards of care this bill is long overdue one in five members of our senior population displays mental difficulties that are not part of the normal aging process in primary care settings , more than a third of senior citizens demonstrate symptoms of depression and impaired social functioning yet only one out of every three mentally ill seniors receives the mental health services he she needs older adults also have one of the highest rates of suicide of any segment of our population in addition , mental illness is the single largest diagnostic category for medicare beneficiaries who qualify as disabled there is a critical need for effective and accessible mental health care for our medicare population recent research has found a direct relationship between treating depression in older adults and improved physical functioning associated with independent living unfortunately , the current structure of medicare mental health benefits is inadequate and presents multiple barriers to access of essential treatment this bill addresses these problems the medicare mental health modernization act is a straightforward bill that improves medicare 's mental health benefits as follows it reduces the discriminatory co payment for outpatient mental health services from percent to the percent level charged for most other part b medical services it eliminates the arbitrary day lifetime cap on inpatient services in psychiatric hospitals it improves beneficiary access to mental health services by including within medicare a number of community based residential and intensive outpatient mental health services that characterize today 's state of the art clinical practices it further improves access to needed mental health services by addressing the shortage of qualified mental health professionals serving older and disabled americans in rural and other medically underserved areas by allowing state licensed marriage and family therapists and mental health counselors to provide medicare covered services similarly , it corrects a legislative oversight that will facilitate the provision of mental health services by clinical social workers within skilled nursing facilities it requires the secretary of health and human services to conduct a study to examine whether the medicare criteria to cover therapeutic services to beneficiaries with alzheimer 's and related cognitive disorders discriminates by being too restrictive in april , president bush identified unfair treatment limitations placed on mental health benefits as a major barrier to mental health care and urged congress to enact legislation that would provide full parity in the health insurance coverage of mental and physical illnesses we 've made important strides forward for the under population twenty six states have enacted full mental health parity the federal employees health benefits plan fehbp was improved in to assure that all federal employees and members of congress are provided parity for mental health and substance abuse treatment this month , representatives kennedy and ramstad introduced h r , the paul wellstone mental health and addiction equity act , to provide full parity for mental health and substance abuse in the private insurance market nationwide i'm proud to join them in support of this legislation , which was introduced with cosponsors well more than the majority needed to pass the house of representatives while some in the business community are concerned about increased costs associated with providing these benefits , a recent study of the fehbp mental health coverage concluded that implementation of parity benefits led to negligible cost increases in fact , some businesses are now embracing parity because they recognize the increased productivity from workers over the long run and how improving access to mental health services has the potential to avoid other additional costly care i am similarly sure that modernizing the medicare mental health benefit will reduce unnecessary spending medicare mental health expenses have historically been heavily skewed toward more expensive inpatient services , with percent of the total going to inpatient care and only percent toward outpatient services in this relationship is in contrast to national trends showing a reversal in inpatient and outpatient spending over the past decade in the last years , inpatient spending declined from percent to percent , while outpatient spending increased from percent to percent of all mental health spending in addition , improving beneficiary access to timely mental health care could well yield savings by minimizing the need for other services science has demonstrated that mental illness and substance abuse are manifestations of biological diseases it is long past time for us to take action with regard to medicare 's inadequate mental health benefits and structure over the years , congress has updated medicare 's benefits for treatment of physical illnesses as the practice of medicine has changed the mental health field has undergone many advances over the past several decades effective research validated interventions have been developed for many mental conditions that affect stricken beneficiaries most mental conditions no longer require long term hospitalizations , and can be effectively treated in less restrictive community settings this bill recognizes these advances in clinical treatment practices and adjusts medicare 's mental health coverage to account for them the medicare mental health modernization act removes discriminatory features from the medicare mental health benefits while facilitating access to up to date and affordable mental health services for our senior citizens and people with disabilities i urge my colleagues to join mr ramstad , mr kennedy , and myself in support of this important legislation and to work with us to improve mental health coverage for everyone
