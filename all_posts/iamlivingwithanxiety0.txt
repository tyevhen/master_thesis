texting is a part of daily life for many of us it can be a quick and convenient way to communicate it can also be a source of anxiety one of the unspoken rules of texting is that you do n't have to immediately reply just like an e mail message , it 's understood that you 'll respond when available , unlike a phone conversation however , we often apply expectations about how long it should take for a person to reply and , when they fail to do so , become anxious such reactions are normal and commonplace for nervous people , however , this anxiety can precipitate into a working up process if one is n't vigilant for example , i recently had a wonderful date we seemed to enjoy our company and have a lot in common when i sent a follow up text expressing my enjoyment , i did n't receive a reply right away ok , i thought , no biggie then some hours went by without a reply i started to work myself up my heart began to race a bit my mind started to whirl does this person not like me ? did i do something wrong ? did i text too early ? admittedly , such reactions are average , and i acknowledged that i also spotted that if i continued this line of thinking , i was at risk of ruining my day after all , these were just my feelings about the situation , not the facts i decided to practice objectivity by taking my mind off the situation by working in the yard and a few hours later i did indeed receive a text back nervous people will find themselves being anxious in everyday situations just like everyone else these trivialities of everyday life , however , can spiral into larger worrying unless we spot them and practice our recovery training
