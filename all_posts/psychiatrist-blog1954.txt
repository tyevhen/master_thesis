dr a wants to talk about electronic patient records who can blame him ? it 's all the rage okay , so psychiatrists do n't do electronic patient records , at least none that i know of i work part time in a clinic associated with a major hospital center , for every department except psychiatry , notes go into an epr system from my point of view , this is terrific , when a patient comes in and says they 're on the white pill for their blood pressure , i can access the primary care note and see which little white pill when they say a lump was found in their you name the body part , i can look up the radiology reports and see whether this is worrisome or not need labs ? maybe they were done last week and do n't need to be needlessly repeated , i can look them up ! so what 's the down side ? privacy , i suppose , and really i do n't think about this from a health care point of view , but from the perspective of being a potential patient employee of this major medical center there are safeguards on the system employees are told never to access the records of those who are n't their patients , we are told that who accesses the info is easily traceable , and the sanctions are considerable , but there is n't a full proof guarantee that someone who is curious wo n't access someone else 's records somehow , my baseline is to be fairly paranoid about my own medical information this is an interesting concept given that my existence has generated a minimal amount of medical information , none of it too colorful , and it mostly boils down to i never want anyone anywhere to know what i weigh still , some of my patients google me , and some of my patients have access to the epr might a curious patient do the google equivalent of checking out their own docs in the epr ? just as an aside , how does confidentiality work if a health care worker patient confesses to a psychiatrist that he has illegally accessed the psychiatrist 's private medical information ? can the shrink break confidentiality in order to stop the patient from continuing to violate his own confidentiality ? hmm let 's not even go there and i'm sorry if i gave anyone a headache thinking about this and what about my co workers , my supervisees , and a good number of my friends and neighbors , many of whom can enter the epr ? the bottom line is that i 'd have to be pretty sick to seek care where i work so no , i 've never looked up any one in the epr out of curiosity when i see a patient in my private practice who has had care at the hospital , i ask permission to look up their medical information invariably , i'm told , you 're my doctor , of course you can look at my records it seems to me that i need to ask permission , given that they are seeking my help in an isolated setting and would n't naturally assume i 'd have access to this information when i see a patient in the clinic , i never ask permission , i often have their medical records printed out in front of me before they even arrive by getting care at this hospital , a patient implicitly gives consent to have their information entered into the epr take my poll
