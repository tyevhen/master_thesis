in case you missed it , charlie rose had quite the guest list this week in episode of his brain series helen mayberg , jeffrey lieberman , kay redfield jamison , eric kandel , stephen warren and elyn saks in science health on thursday , july , here is a link with the transcript of the interviews http www charlierose com view interview frame top nobel prize winner dr eric r kandel co hosts the show with charlie rose , and to quote dr kandel from the transcript the whole history of psychiatry , which is a culmination of emile kraepelin , is interesting we ve known about these illnesses since hippocrates , the great greek physician in the th century , who not only spoke about depression and manic depressive psychosis but specifically indicated that these are medical illnesses but this basic idea was lost on european medicine for the longest period of time during the middle ages , even later in the renaissance period , these were thought as demonic disorders , people possessed by the devil or moral degeneracy and people with mental disorders were put away in insane asylums usually far removed from the center of town and often they were kept in chains so they don t move around fortunately , this situation was reversed in about the paris school of medicine began to really express a very modern view of medical science and philippe pinel , a great french psychiatrist , realized psychiatric disorders , as hippocrates had said , are medical illnesses , and he began to institute humane treatment , the beginning of psychotherapy with mental patients but from to about , no progress was made in understanding psychiatric disorders one couldn t localize them specifically so one didn t know is there one mental illness or are there many ? and that s when our mutual hero , emile kraepelin , came on the scene and his textbooks which began to emerge around and continued until he died in , he outlines , for example , in this book in his first three chapters he defines the fact that mental illnesses are not unitary they affect two different processes , they affect mood , emotion on the one hand , and affect thinking on the other and he defined the disorders that affect mood depression and manic depressive disorder , and he defined the disorders of thinking as schizophrenia he called it dementia praecox he thought it was a deterioration of cognitive process in the brain early in life , praecox and as you outlined , we have some insight into the nature of these diseases we know that depression is an illness that involves mood , which is associated with the feeling of worthlessness , an inability to enjoy life nothing , it s all pervasive nothing gives one pleasure and there s a feeling of helplessness , of worthlessness , often leading to thoughts of suicide and , tragically , to suicide attempts themselves and percent of people that have depression also have manic depressive illness they have the opposite end of the spectrum they feel fantastic at the beginning of the disease they feel better than they ve ever felt in their life but ultimately this leads to grandiosity and frank psychotic episodes schizophrenia is a thought disorder that has three types of symptoms positive , negative , and cognitive the positive symptoms are characteristic i can of schizophrenia it s the thought disorder , hallucinations , delusions , the acting crazy the negative symptoms are the social withdrawal , the lack of motivation and the cognitive disorders are the difficulty with organizing one s life and a difficulty with a certain kind of memory , called working memory , short term memory fortunately , as you indicated , we can now see people who have had effective treatment who have very productive lives and kay jamison and elyn saks , despite the fact they suffered the this disorder much of their life , have rich personal lives , both of them involved in meaningful interpersonal relationships , marriage , that is very satisfying to them and having spectacular academic careers so there s tremendous hope for the treatment of the disease
