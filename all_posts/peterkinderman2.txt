a talk given to the south east thames division of clinical psychology agm friday nd march thank you just to introduce myself and to set out my credentials , i have twice now been chair of the dcp , i m currently the leader of a large multidisciplinary research group at liverpool , combining public health , primary care and psychology , and i have myself been a user of mental health services so my title today is what will clinical psychology look like in ? i am hugely optimistic the future for my profession is bright and positive i know that , when i say that these days , audiences tend to be more sceptical the health and social care bill , the restructuring and even privatization of the nhs the recession , cuts in local authority funding these financial constraints and re organisations put pressures on the employment prospects of clinical and other applied psychologists and with a conservative government , we see a lurch to the right in our case leading to the danger of old fashioned and disadvantageous forms of care provision clinical psychologists , it s argued , are facing cuts and downgrading and our positive vision for care is equally under threat but i m really sorry i m just much more positive than that i think we have a fantastic , even transformational , message and i think that , in , we ll see a robust , effective , authoritative profession first , a little history and context in , as i was training to be a clinical psychologist , the mas management advisory service wrote a report on the future of what they called healthcare psychology what we d now call applied psychology clinical , health , forensic psychology this was , in truth , an inside job it was psychologists making recommendations about their own profession but it s still worth quoting their recommendations in order to realise the desirable staffing patterns , it will be necessary to aim ultimately for a minimum of , healthcare psychologists to achieve this target it would be necessary to establish at least training posts now there are at least , members of the division of clinical psychology alone , and we re training new graduates from the d clin psych doctorates per year versus the recommended we have achieved double what we aspired to achieve just think about that our own psychologists , arguing for investment in clinical psychology , challenged the department of health to invest in our profession and they responded by giving us twice what we asked for i do understand that there are difficulties at present i think , to be candid , that many working people are finding the present period difficult but clinical psychology is hardly in crisis we have seen major policy and legislative support for our work i am fully aware that there are tensions over the development of nice guidelines and iapt services but let s take a step backwards and get some perspective nice and iapt i do think that the general principle of the nice guidelines is great we systematically review the evidence and an expert practitioner committee makes recommendations about best cost effective care i understand the criticisms of this system it s cost effective care , not necessarily gold standard care the system is heavily weighted on rcts randomised controlled trials and diagnostic categories i am also aware that many of my colleagues feel that cbt has its limitations but a proportionate look at nice guidelines should , i think , make you very confident again and again , the evidence points to the effectiveness of straightforward psychosocial interventions similarly , when we look at iapt , while i absolutely see the difficulties , i do think that the picture is hugely positive i understand that cbt is not the only fruit i m less sympathetic with the idea that cbt therapists are taking clinical psychologists jobs it consultants have replaced typewriter engineers , and that s just the way it is but i do agree that we shouldn t tolerate sticking plaster solutions and poor quality care some of the aspects of iapt concern me but , again , the general principle of the iapt programme is wonderful since psychosocial approaches are effective , let s invest in them and although we ve not seen a fantastic process of implementation the basic idea was to see thousands of new cbt therapists mainly recruited from existing mental health care staff and thousands of extra clinical psychologists supervising them vision we also have a positive vision for care back in , the world health organisation defined health as a state of complete physical , mental and social well being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity , and mental health as a state of well being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities , can cope with the normal stresses of life , can work productively and fruitfully , and is able to make a contribution to his or her community these hugely attractive definitions were , in my opinion , improved upon by the eu who defined mental health as a resource which enables them to realise their intellectual and emotional potential and to find and fulfil their roles in social , school and working life and also just to make things nearly perfect added that the mental condition of people is determined by a multiplicity of factors including biological e g , genetics , gender , individual e g , personal experiences , family and social e g , social support and economic and environmental e g , social status and living conditions that is , of course , great for clinical psychologists we re helping people fulfil their potential as human beings , not treating illnesses this means linking to the wider government well being agenda which has significant but very positive consequences for our profession , and our relationship with other professions of course , of course , there should be one to one psychotherapy but we should also be offering more fully holistic services we should be linking with jobcentre plus employment advisers who are delivering what are effectively wellbeing interventions for people we should be working with the education services and we should be working with the physical health services we should be working with employers , there s plenty of evidence that interventions aimed at improving people s wellbeing not curing their mental illnesses but improving people s wellbeing is productive for employers we should be working with rd sector organisations and the wider civil society and for me , this means that our employers need to be supportive of that way of working we need to be remunerated and employed and contracted and commissioned to deliver the sort of services that people say they want commissioning i think that gps share these aspirations gps , for many years , have seen their role as incorporating the protection of public health gps see the whole person , across the lifespan that means gps have a natural affinity for the type of care we also want this is important as the ccgs the clinical commissioning groups get to work important because it is gps , who share this vision , who will dominate ccgs and important , also that the local authority health and well being boards will have such a significant role the social and political context our health and well being are intimately related to social , economic and even political issues my colleagues ben barr and david taylor robinson in liverpool have demonstrated how deaths here in the uk can be specifically attributed to the economic crisis ben and david have also revealed that the cuts in local authority spending are falling hardest on the poorest with central government funds withdrawn most severely from the most deprived communities this matters , because our research starts in the social and human realities of our clients lives we therefore understand that our core business is much less about treating illnesses and much more about promoting well being that s why psychological contribution to the office for national statistics programme to measure national well being , and approaches such as the now ubiquitous ways to well being , developed in part by my colleague sam thompson , are so important and it s why the health and well being boards could be so significant and positive for our profession added value so the future is , i think , very positive but what we need to do is demonstrate the value of our work there s a hackneyed phrase of kennedy jfk ask not what your country can do for you , ask what you can do for your country i m less interested in the navel gazing of clinical psychologists and much more interested , to be honest , in what we have to offer on september st , the nobel prize winning civil rights leader martin luther king jr delivered a speech entitled the role of the behavioral scientist in the civil rights movement to the american psychological association with eloquence and passion , martin luther king championed the civil rights struggle and spoke about how people like me could and should support the civil rights movement this speech is particularly relevant today most powerfully , martin luther king said there are some things in our society , some things in our world , to which we must always be maladjusted if we are to be people of good will if there were a martin luther king for , he or she would call on us to speak out , to identify and to condemn those things that should be condemned we should refuse to tolerate the unacceptable and to act accordingly in , martin luther king identified a number of key issues that should be the focus for behavioural scientists urban riots , the vietnam war , unemployment and civil disobedience it s remarkable how well these issues have persisted over two generations we have seen urban riots on the streets of major uk cities in the very recent past , we have military adventures in iraq , afghanistan and mali , we have mass unemployment and we have civil disobedience today in the shape of the occupy movement we would add social and economic inequalities , the credit crisis , with its lethal impact on citizens well being , and climate change i would add humane care for people with disabilities and mental health problems and the social circumstances that determine more than any biological factors and more than any therapy the well being and mental health of our clients diagnosis in i published a very simple paper with erika setzu , fiona lobban and peter salmon it was simple because all we did , in essence , was interview people about how they had ended up in mental health care one quote is worth repeating at length client i started to hear voices , but they were not nice voices , they were horrible interviewer did you recognise them ? client it was the man that abused me i met this man that was a builder , in construction , you know ? and he said that he wanted to give me a job , but they were all lies , he was trying to con me he took me back to his house , he locked the door and he had sex with me and then other voices as well i went to hospital and the nurses were very good to me interviewer when you went to hospital what did they say it was wrong with you ? client schizophrenia , paranoid schizophrenia interviewer what do you think personally ? client what do you mean ? interviewer do you think it is what you ve got ? client oh yes , that s what i have got we should be creatively maladjusted to this creeping medicalization of human distress right now , the american psychiatric association is preparing to publish the latest version of its diagnostic manuals dsm it seems clear that this manifestation of the medicalization of human distress will be more paradoxically illogical , more invalid , more stigmatising , and more pervasively likely to pathologise normal human reactions than ever before so , please , join me , anne and richard and others in the audience , in registering our concern you can do this by going to our website dsmresponse com and adding your voice treatment and when it comes to treatments , there are again things to which we should be maladjusted we must refuse to tolerate the cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment of people in psychiatric care this includes the appalling inhumanity described correctly by the united nations as akin to torture but such extremes are also supported by everyday inhumanity and by the inadequate , cruel and uncaring treatment experienced every day and in many if perhaps not all settings on the same day i read the un report , a man wrote to me describing his experiences of psychiatric 'care' the whole incident is traumatic from the initial involuntary admission in handcuffs , by the police to discharge i was particularly struck , however , by the everyday inadequacy of the inpatient stay this wo n't be terribly surprising to people working in mental health care but the fact that this account will be recognised speaks to its truth my correspondent reported rather than engaging with the patients on the ward , the staff instead shepherded them around like sheep with bullying commands , threats of jabs injections , and removal to an acute ward elsewhere in the hospital , if they did not co operate the staff also stressed medication rather than engagement as a way of controlling the patients and the staff closeted themselves in the ward office , instead of being out and about on the corridors and in the vestibule where they should have been the staff wrote daily reports on each patient on the hospital s intranet system these reports were depended upon by the consultant psychiatrists for their diagnoses and medication prescriptions , but were patently fabricated and false , because the staff had never engaged or observed properly the patient they were writing about in their reports the psychiatrists themselves were rarely seen on the ward , and only consulted with their patients once a week i certainly recognise this account it does n't represent absolutely all psychiatric units but it is n't bizarre or unrepresentative it reflects in psychiatric rather than acute medical care the findings of the francis report into uncaring and inhumane treatment in the mid staffordshire nhs scandal and we should absolutely refuse to accept it i do n't want to accept this as the status quo and we should absolutely refuse to accept it i do n't want to accept this as the status quo conclusion in the words of the european union , good mental health is a resource which enables them to realise their intellectual and emotional potential and to find and fulfil their roles in social , school and working life for societies , good mental health of citizens contributes to prosperity , solidarity and social justice psychologists are now and will in the future be key to delivering this vision in it will be recognised that clinical psychologists are a key profession in helping people fulfil their potential as human beings , not treating illnesses outcomes will be driven by real people service user s definitions of what they need as real world outcomes and psychological therapies will be designed and commissioned to that end for us as psychologists , we will be offering a broader , more holistic service yes , of course , because we re experts in psychological therapies , we ll offer one to one therapy but , as we ve always wanted to , we ll offer more fully holistic services linking with employment advisors , working with education services , physical health services , with employers , with community services this means rather different professional links as much with the royal college of gps as with the royal college of psychiatrists and it means better links with the other applied psychologist groups since a genuine view of well being integrates clinical psychologists interest in mental health with occupational psychologists interest in employment , educational psychologists interest in education , health psychologists , forensic psychologists etc addressing the full range of a person s well being means coordinating services across a wide range of domains , across many different services education , health , employment a multi disciplinary service and it strikes me as pretty obvious that , within those multi disciplinary services , we ll see the judicious use of colleagues trained , rapidly , in mono modal therapies but , in , clinical psychologists will be coordinating the higher level case formulations within which those mono modal therapies will be delivered so we should be upfront and positive good mental health and well being is a consequence of how we make sense of and understand the world , primarily our social world and how we make sense of and understand the world is largely determined by our experiences and upbringing i believe that the future lies in helping policy makers , the media and commissioners realise the potential benefits of our skills , and in integrating our work with a much wider program of improvement of health and well being across a number of government departments that requires us to be confident and imaginative as we look to the future but it s all good news thank you very much
