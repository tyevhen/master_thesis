i met with my psychiatrist today not much new to report , although i have noticed a little dip in my mood over the past few days actually , i noticed the dip on monday , in the stairwell , at work , around pm literally it literally hit me like that uh oh , i thought , i'm feeling a little low my discovery was followed by a brief moment of worry , and then i went back to work i think it is relatively rare to be so in tune with one 's mood that microscopic changes become apparent perhaps this is a side effect of having depression perhaps the years of struggle have trained my brain to be the microscope , to take note of every little change up or down even as i noted my tiny dip monday , i thought it was strange i'm not sure if this microscope effect is good or bad it 's not like i go around worrying about my mood i do n't spend my waking moments taking note of every perturbation sometimes , like on monday , it just hits me boom , your mood has changed weird good ? bad ? i do n't know it just is , i guess
