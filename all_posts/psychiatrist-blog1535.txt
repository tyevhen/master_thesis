in cycling and running there 's a phenomenon known as bonking bonking is when you just suddenly get overcome by exhaustion and you collapse to be scientific about it , you 'deplete glycogen stores' and ca n't go on a friend of mine tells me that this happens to hummingbirds they can be found collapsed on the ground , exhausted , which is n't too surprising for a creature whose heart beats up to a thousand times a minute fortunately they can be revived with a little sugar water there are days when i can really identify with those little guys on days when i see twenty plus patients , when everyone is in crisis , when i just ca n't seem to find a chart or the medication nurse ca n't find my order , at some point you hit the wall and bonk it 's that moment when i think to myself that i will just walk out of the facility and never come back unfortunately , sugar water just does n't do it for me this is what to do to revive a correctional psychiatrist in case you ever find one lying on the ground , exhausted , with a heart rate somewhat lower than a thousand beats a minute administer coffee immediately , followed by judicious amounts of dark belgian chocolate do n't worry about checking for consciousness first , just hit the starbucks if this does n't work consider depositing a large , warm , furry and loudly purring cat on the psychiatrist 's stomach this is also a test for consciousness since those tiny sharp kneading claws are bound to get a reaction once revived , deposit the psychiatrist in the middle of a large quiet forest with miles of hiking trails trail map included allow time for staring up at tree branches , listening to the wind whistle , admiring large fungi and searching the stream for minnows repeat , ad infinitum , until smiles return i suspect every psychiatrist has their own particular favorite ways to recover from the hummingbird bonk dinah is relaxing in a warm , sunny place and roy seems to find comfort in buying new very large computer monitors i'm jealous regardless of the recovery method , we will all find our way back to shrink rap eventually
