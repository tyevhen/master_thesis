this email was written to a friend two and a half weeks before i left for kenya where i would live for a year as a missionary wednesday , august , i am thinking over things a bit seriously tonight it seems to get more and more real every day you know , the fact that i am really doing this , that i am really going to kenya as a missionary , that i will really be totally living with the daily purpose of telling people about jesus and helping them to grow closer to him can you believe that ? i mean , i guess that is what i am supposed to be doing now anyway , but it seems so much more real and more my purpose now that is my whole reason in moving half way around the world to a whole new culture people here have given from what they have to support me believing that god can use me that is so overwhelming at times sometimes it feels like i really have no idea what i am doing , that i have nothing of worth to offer i just try not to let myself listen to that because i remember that god can do whatever he wants and use whomever he wants it is not me and my abilities that are important , but god working through me i want him to do that so badly sorry , tears just started running down my cheeks i started thinking about how badly i want god to use me to bring people to an intimate relationship with him , but then i think about how much of my relationship with him i am missing i interact with him on one level and just go along like that thinking everything is okay , but i think i could have more i have been realizing even more lately that an intimate relationship with someone is something that has to be really worked at if i want it to be good and strong and stand the test of time and be absolutely beautiful i guess i have to be willing to remain faithful as a close companion even in the times that it feels like i am a million miles away from the one i love with god , i guess that means being faithful in prayers and reading , studying , and meditating on his word i have a feeling that god is really going to work on me this year i know that there are some things that i need to learn and start practicing as a consistent and remaining part of my life , things that i would like to have ingrained into my life i want to be close to my source of strength , god , so that i will not mistakenly try to draw my strength from another source instead and drain the joy out of the good thing things that are happening in my life i want to be able to look up in love for my savior , and then look out in service for others , but if i get too inwardly focused and only see my troubles and struggles , then it will be hard to do that this is my desire to love jesus wow , you really got a lot from me tonight i just let my thought flow through my fingers as they came thank you for listening well , reading i guess good night , cindy
