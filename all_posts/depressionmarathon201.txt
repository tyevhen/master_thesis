metaphors describing depression are plentiful the black dog , the black hole , and a heavy leaden cloak are just a few i 've heard used but today i'm going to describe my depression as an exploded bomb which detonated right in the middle of my life a few weeks back in less than weeks , my life has gone up in smoke as a result of this illness today i am here picking up the salvageable pieces left over after that violent explosion four weeks ago i was working regular shifts as often as i wished i was scheduled out through mid september i was financially sound and my obligations were met today i am getting ready to return to work paying my bills was put on hold as depression ripped me away from gainful employment it will take awhile before i am able to get back to working a regular schedule and to catch up financially i am picking up the pieces of my financial life four weeks ago , despite not being able to run , i had the energy and motivation to exercise as much as i wished i was in fine physical shape i had muscles , fit into my clothing , and felt good about how i looked today i am just getting back onto my bike i have enough energy for a gentle minute ride push ups and sit ups are exhausting i 've gained pounds and no longer fit nicely into my jeans i'm picking up the pieces of my physical existence four weeks ago i ran errands and performed my chores without contemplation today i debate the pros and cons of every adventure outside my front door do i have the energy ? does it need to be done today ? does it need to be done at all ? likewise , i am living with a rising tide of unfulfilled duties inside my house as my mood declined so too did my standards it will take awhile to get things back to snuff around here i am picking up the pieces of my home life this depression relapse left carnage in its wake my job now is to collect and reassemble all of the salvageable pieces i'm hoping to rebuild my life so that it resembles what stood here before the depression bomb detonated but that is a tall order , and i truly do not know how long it will take i have a feeling i 'll need to practice my patience , too , during this rebuilding process
