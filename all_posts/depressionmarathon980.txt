if it had n't been for the assignment , i know i would n't have gotten out the door i went for a minute run walk this evening it was very , very slow , but i went i went despite a hellish ly long and busy day at work i went despite collapsing on my bed and immediately falling asleep as soon as i got home my dog , puck , finally woke me up hours later if he had n't had to pee , i might still be asleep but since he got me up , instead of sleep i slowly ran and walked for minutes my therapist gave me an assignment last week actually , she gave me a couple tasks in an effort to get me out of my house and back on track the first assignment was to contact renee and set up our running date i did that the even more difficult task was to exercise at least minutes per day that was the assignment on my mind tonight as i stumbled around my house in a sleepy stupor it was putting a check in that box on my calendar , the one labeled minutes of exercise , that got me out the door simple why is it something as simple as checking a box can get us to accomplish things we would n't or could n't otherwise do ? being held accountable , i think , is exactly what i needed i was tired , groggy , and sore , but i exercised so i could put a check in my box it worked thanks , deb
