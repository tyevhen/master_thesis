is a composite based on many clinical cases and demonstrates the use of the affect bridge in clinical hypnosis treatment alan alan and his wife were married for five years they had a good and stable relationship most of the time however , whenever alan felt that his wife , evelyn , was distracted , not listening to him , or not understanding him , he became very angry and upset an hour or two later , alan usually realized that he over reacted and he would feel very guilty and remorseful at first , evelyn was understanding she accepted his apology and forgave him but , after a while , as this continued to happen , she got annoyed each time that it happened , evelyn tried to remind alan about how he over reacted in the past to similar situations between them and how this was another one of those times but , when alan was in this state , he was unreachable and he could not hear what evelyn was saying when they came in as a couple , alan admitted that he would over react for relatively minor incidents with his wife he explained how , at the time , it felt like she was ignoring him or not hearing him , and this felt intolerable to him in that moment he said he felt like he was going crazy because , when he was upset with his wife , he could n't hold onto the fact that this was another situation where he was over reacting to her no matter how many times it happened as i explored alan 's history , he talked about having an alcoholic mother who had a long history of drinking heavily and then passing out on the couch , leaving alan and his younger brother to fend for themselves his father had left the family when alan was three , so there were no other adults in the household during the preparatory phase of our work together , i asked alan to choose protective figures that he could visualize i told him that they could either be real people that he knew or , if there was no one , he could visualize a fictional character from a book , movie , or tv program alan chose to visualize his first grade teacher and his little league coach as his protectors for the clinical hypnosis work we were about to do i suggested to alan that he picture these protective figures as being with him as we began our hypnosis work together , which he was able to do using the affect bridge technique , i asked alan to focus on the feeling that he had when he felt that his wife was not paying attention to him or not hearing or understanding him he said he felt it like a tense , heavy feeling in his stomach then , i asked him to go back in his mind and remember the first time that he felt this way alan remembered many incidents with his mother when she did n't hear him because she was in a drunken stupor his earliest memory of these feelings was when he was four years old as usual , his mother was passed out on the couch as a result of a day of heavy drinking alan was trying to cook a meal for himself and his younger brother when his pajama sleeve caught on fire he became very frightened and called out to his mother to help him , but she did n't hear him although he was very frightened , he was able to turn off the gas by himself , but not before he sustained a second degree burn on his arm the neighbor who lived downstairs heard his cries and came running upstairs to help him his mother never roused herself from her sleep revisiting this memory during clinical hypnosis sessions and picturing his protective figures with him and helping him at that time had a healing effect on alan although alan knew what had actually happened when he was four and he got burned , after a while , being able to re experience this memory with his protective figures allowed him to heal this old wound he felt safe , protected and nurtured by the protective figures that he visualized as a result , after doing this hypnotherapy work for a while , he was no longer triggered when his wife either did n't hear him or misunderstood what he said it was not just a matter that alan realized this in a logical way , he actually felt healed and the old trauma was resolved getting help with clinical hypnosis clinical hypnosis is a safe and effective form of treatment when
