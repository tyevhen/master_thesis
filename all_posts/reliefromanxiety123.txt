unlike some people , my depression came about as a result of my severe anxiety that i faced however , i would say that my suicidal thoughts and depression were felt as young as the age of , before my anxiety even became such a detrimental problem at the time , i did n't tend to pay much attention , i just knew that i was in a very dark place at times luckily , these were far and few between until my breakdown at the age of as soon as my anxiety became so severe that i could n't leave the house , my depression crept in and took over my whole being and there was nothing i could do about it everything in my life was taken away by my anxiety including school , friends , driving , picking up the phone , answering the door and even walking to the end of my road i could n't do anything and to be stuck inside and incapable of doing anything triggered my depression to a severe extent it 's difficult to describe what depression is if you have n't experienced it yourself , but i have tried my best to summarize it , here it was when the sky was blue and yet everything was dark for me , it meant not caring for my appearance , always wearing black , having sleeping troubles , always feeling tired , having no motivation to do anything i loved not that i had much ability to do that anyway ! , loss of weight , endless crying , hysterics , not being able to get out of bed , loss of control , suicidal thoughts and some self harm i was in a very troubled and dangerous place for my existence the depression and mental health struggles i faced were absolute hell , and i was often pulled between the pillars of life and death on a regular basis keeping going was an immense struggle however , i am glad i did i remember days and days where i would n't be interested in anything and i would just sleep to get some rest bite i also remember times when my counselor had to come to my home because i was in such a terrible depressive state that i could n't get outside i must admit i hated filling in the depression and suicidal forms when i felt in such a bad way but , i know they were there to look after me , along side my family , friends and teachers and i thank them greatly nowadays , as my anxiety has reduced and i am on medication , my depressive episodes are few and far between however , i can find depression creeping up on me randomly and for no reason at all unfortunately , depression runs in the family and this is something that i continue to battle for those of you who know what depression is like , you 'll know exactly what i have and can go through and for those of you that have n't , i hope you never ever have to , but please still educate yourself on this matter for all of those fighting the immense struggle , please keep going there is light at the end of the tunnel i was once in your position and now i am well on my way to recovery i know you can do it too trust me on this ! keep going life can be beautiful amy xx
