pfizer says no ! akzo nobel nv said its unit organon and pfizer inc agreed to end their collaboration in the further development of antipsychotic drug asenapine , but this will have no effect on the planned stock market flotation of organon pfizer 's decision to discontinue its participation in the asenapine development program 'is an outcome of a commercial analysis of the compound as a part of its overall portfolio , ' the companies said organon will continue to develop the product regardless of pfizer 's lack of collaboration according to www clinicaltrials gov , there are studies that have investigated the drug or are currently recruiting patients looks like organon is swinging for both bipolar and schizophrenia however , is this compound not late to the game ? the atypical market is flooded and i'm going to boldly predict that asenapine will work no better than any existing product it 's going to take a whale of a marketing effort to push this one to importance for organon 's sake , i hope they can get a better market share with asenapine than they did with mirtazapine remeron source
