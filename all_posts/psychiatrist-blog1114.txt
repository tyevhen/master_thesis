i entered the yard and started cleaning up a bit i pick up the end of the hammock that had fallen , shook it out , and reattached it to the tree i finished and reached for my keys to go inside hey i turned no one was there but i 'd heard the hey distinctly , though my ears , really i waited , no one said anything i looked up at the windows , maybe one of my kids had called out but , no , the windows were closed my first voice , i thought this must be what it 's like there was n't really anything to do , it was just a simple hey loud and clear it was a bit disconcerting , but i went inside and promptly forgot about it my cell phone was on the counter i picked it up and saw a message roy had texted got here early and i'm sitting on the patio ah ! my voice ! it was roy , of course , lurking in the bushes why did n't you say anything else ? i asked i did n't want to scare you , he said oh and of course there 's no one else whose voice i 'd rather hear !
