have you heard about parapluesch ? they are a german toy company currently marketing stuffed cuddlytoys with mental illnesses huh ? i just heard about them , so i checked out their website it is very strange there is a selection of small stuffed animals who are apparently supposed to represent different mental illnesses for the life of me , i could n't figure out which one portrayed which illness one of the toys is a sheep do sheep have mental illness ? how about a crocodile with a pillow ? what do you suppose that represents ? i have no idea it is a very strange website the toys are odd the concept is odd but the game on their website is offensive it 's called the asylum psychiatric clinic for abused cuddlytoys what the ? okay , so all of us with mental illness have been abused ? if you were abused you will certainly have a mental illness ? all victims of abuse require psychiatry ? i do n't get it i tried the game it was also very odd if you are old enough to remember the game myst , i think this game is somewhat like that i think you have to find your way from somewhere to somewhere by going through therapy with various animals or maybe curing them and getting them out of the clinic ? it 's hard to say there are no instructions no directions no clues as to the premise of the game on second thought , maybe this is n't offensive at all maybe it 's just plain stupid can anyone explain this to me ?
