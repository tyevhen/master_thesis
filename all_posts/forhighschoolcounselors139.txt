as i am searching the news over my winter break , i ran across this unbelievable story about three british school girls who left home to join isis in syria at first i thought this story was an anomaly , but after some research , i found out that this situation is becoming more of a common occurrence for young women from the west so after finding out about this serious issue , i decided to share my research with my fellow school counselors for school counselors , the question becomes if this is a passing phase or a dangerous new trend that may impact our teenage girls ? one last introductory comment , this was a very difficult post to write and i really thought about stopping however , i felt it was really important information to share ! i hope you will agree the isis quiz first , how much do you know about isis ? before you read this blog any further , please take this quick quiz to test your knowledge just so you know i failed how much do you know about isis ? take the quiz what is isis ? okay , so what is the big deal about this group called isis and why should we be concerned as school counselors ? the root of isis was originally formed in the early 's by jordanian abu musab al zarqawi after the us invaded iraq in , al zarqawi formed the forerunner to the present day terror group which had a similar message as osama bin laden although al zarqawi and bin laden had the same theology , al zarqawi targeted other muslims who did not fall in line with his interpretation of the law his violent campaigns eventually won him fame and even the praise of bin laden eventually , al zarqawi emerged as a spiritual leader who began to insist that everyone should follow his harsh interpretation of sharia law after the bombing of iraq by the us , al zarqawi and his group faded and isis later reemerged after the us left iraq in the new and current leader of isis , baghdadi , expanded to syria and reestablished their interpretation of sharia law baghdadi and his group target nonbelievers and the fighters are given discretion to bring any nonbeliever into the islamic state by conversion or death the goal of isis , also known as the islamic state , is to bring sharia law to all nonbelievers even if it includes using foreign teens to accomplish their vision resource short political history of isis current isis controlled territory so , why would a teenage girl leave her comfortable suburban home , travel to the middle east , meet up with complete strangers , and join their cause ? psychologists have postulated the reasons why people join extreme or violent groups like cults , gangs , or terror groups some of these reasons include searching for true friendship looking to find a sense of identity finding a worldview that determines right from wrong exploring security in an uncertain world searching for a lifestyle that has structure and order source psychology today if these groups offer such positive rewards then why are they so dangerous to our youth ?
