after putting up yesterday 's post about the strong link between depression and fructose malabsoprtion in women and adolescents , my mind continued to spin for a while and i woke up this morning with more questions if you have n't read that post , you probably should before diving into this one , as it wo n't make nearly as much sense without the initial information first of all , the estrogen link the study noted that none of the participants were on prescription medicines except oral contraceptives oral contraceptives have widely varying amounts of estrogen , but the study probably would have been too small to have detected a lot of difference it makes one wonder they also postulated that fructose malabsorption would make premenstrual dysphoria worse , again using the explanation that estrogen 's effect on the liver makes the already low amount of tryptophan made into serotonin even lower however , progesterone is the more likely culprit in premenstrual dysphoria , and depression is a well known side effect of progesterone only birth control methods look at the hormone levels in this diagram of the menstrual cycle while estrogen is higher in the second half of the month , when premenstrual dysphoria is likely to occur , it really only spikes just before ovulation , in the middle of the month progesterone is quite low at the beginning , and then rises to steady levels for much of the last part of the cycle , until it drops again progesterone is also involved in the metabolism of serotonin and dopamine , so it could all be related secondly i had no idea that fructose malabsorption was so common when i 've seen notes or mentions of it around the internet , i had a mental note in my head rare and i must have been thinking of hereditary fructose intolerance , which can cause liver damage and is quite rare probably not much was known about fructose malabsorption when i was in medical school , or i would have remembered it i mean , everyone knows about lactose intolerance , after all but the fact that fructose malabsorption is so common could explain quite a bit about the increasing prevalence and changing symptoms of depression these days sure , the studies were small , but the effects of the carbohydrate malabsorption were quite large , which means that there 's a good chance the data is meaningful a lot of people men and women now have signs of atypical depression that is characterized by weight gain , fatigue , and prominent carbohydrate cravings low levels of serotonin are thought to trigger carbohydrate cravings , as carbohydrate is thought to increase serotonin levels in the brain an unprecedented change in our western diets has made high fructose foods readily available year round , something that was never possible before industrialization so we have fructose malabsorbers with depleted serotonin craving carbs , munching on sugary foods , leading to more cravings , and a vicious cycle ensues adolescents may be more vulnerable , as they are probably the most likely to have a free fructose laden diet when i discussed the changes in depression symptoms from classical melancholia to the modern , atypical presentation , i had pointed the finger at the omega fatty acids , which may also be involved but fructose could be a very common factor ironically , the fructose which is not absorbed is the problem ! i wish i knew how common fructose malabsorption is in ethnic groups besides central europeans forget straight up zinc deficiency and the exorphins in wheat causing schizophrenia those are relatively rare and cannot explain the recent huge changes and increases in depression and mental illness but fructose malabsorption has the potential to be a huge factor for a good many people if the prevalence holds true for the american population , that 's million people even if it is much higher in those of central european descent , the fact that other ethnic groups have some of it still means millions and millions of people in the u s alone and now a bit more about fructose malabsorption , also from one of jad 's helpful references , fructose malabsorption and symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome guidelines for effective dietary management fructose is found in three forms in the diet as free fructose in fruits , honey , high fructose corn syrup , agave nectar , etc , as part of the disaccharide sucrose glucose fructose , and also as a polymer known as a fructan found in wheat and some vegetables turns out that the other constituents of our diets affect how well we can absorb fructose too glucose helps us absorb fructose , for example , as does the amino acid alanine in moderate amounts , people with ibs symptoms and fructose malabsoprtion did n't get symptoms when they ate sucrose or balanced fructose glucose mixes but in immoderate amounts greater than ml of sucrose sweetened soda was an example in the paper , even sucrose could cause symptoms so what exactly was the recommended diet which was quite effective for the ibs symptoms , according to the study ? patients were advised to avoid the following foods which had an imbalance of fructose compared to glucose apple , pear , guava , melon , mango , papaya , watermelon , star fruit honey anything with the following major sweetening ingredients hfcs , corn syrup solids , fructose , and fruit juice concentrate also avoid the following foods which have a large fructose load grams per serving , balanced with sucrose or not most dried fruits , especially apple , apricot , dates , raisins , pear , figs , and prunes fruit juice , canned packing juice fruit sauces including tomato paste , chutney , relish , plum sauce , sweet and sour sauce , and bbq sauce high sugar fruits cherry , grapes , persimmon , lychee , apple , pear , watermelon coconut milk and cream surely they mean sweetened coconut milk and cream my can of coconut milk has only g of carbohydrate total per serving , and g of sugar fortified wines such as sherry and port ml of sucrose sweetened soft drink excessive intake of confectionery for these items , the patients were advised to substitute apricots , nectarines , peaches , pluma , berries , citrus , ripe banana , and other fruits which have more glucose or equal glucose to fructose they could also consume glucose powder or glucose sweetened sports drink to balance out a fructose load in this paper , substitution was emphasized rather than avoidance of whole food groups , in order to prevent nutritional deficiencies or some such one would n't want to do something scary like eat more fat in lieu of pasta , high fructose fruits , and bread after all ! now the fructans the most problematic ones to be avoided are flour white bread pasta whole grain breakfast cereal muffins crumpets australian study ! crackers cookies leeks jerusalem artichoke onions less of a fructan effect than the others asparagus ditto for onions i'm leaving out chicory root and some other rare foods best you get the paper and see for yourself the complete list again , the patients were encouraged to substitute rye bread or gluten free bread , gluten free pasta and rice and crackers , maple syrup , gluten free cookies , etc and after months on the diet , adhered to the diet most of the time , or frequently of the adherent folks had substantial improvement in ibs symptoms , whereas of the nonadherers had improvement as this was a dietary study for ibs sufferers with a positive test for fructose malabsorption , depression scales were not administered it would have been nice if the researchers threw a couple in there , though , right ? please check out jamie 's post on fodmaps for even more information , and paleo style avoidance of fructose and fructans final food for thought for most people , the vegetable fructans jerusalem artichokes , onions , leeks , and asparagus are thought to aid our health by feeding our bacteria a short chain fatty acid , butyrate , which somehow decreases the permeability of the gut one can also get butyrate from eating butter edited to say sorry meant the opposite the fructans are transformed from the oligosaccharides to the short chain fatty acids by the good bugs thanks avocado !
