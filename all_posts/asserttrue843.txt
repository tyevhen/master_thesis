tim mccune has written an interesting article called exception handling antipatterns , at http today java net a fine place to find articles of this kind , btw the comments at the end of the article are every bit as stimulating as the article itself mccune lists a number of patterns that i find are very widely used nearly universal , in fact in java programming , such as log and rethrow , catch and ignore , and catch and return null all considered evil by mccune my comment is if those are antipatterns , the mere fact that such idioms are so ubiquitous in real world java code says more about the language than it does about programmers i 've always had a love hate relationship with the exception mechanism on the whole , i think it is overused and overrated , at least in the java world , where people seem to get a little nutty about inventing and sublcassing custom exceptions and ways to handle them , when they should probably spend that energy writing better code to begin with
