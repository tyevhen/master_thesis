i'm in the best shape i 've been in since college i can run fast , ride fast and swim fast but i 've yet to master swimming in open water after talking at length with my therapist , it 's clear that my problem is less about swimming and more about fear it 's also clear that this fear , and it 's debilitating effect , took me by surprise and continues to baffle me i knew i had a fear of the water , but i had no idea it would effect me like this scolding myself for having such a fear has also not been helpful this all leaves me entirely up in the air on the one hand , i figure i should just go for it start the triathlon no matter how terrified i might be , because deep inside my brain i know i can swim the distance , and i know i can tread water , and at worst i panic and get pulled out well , actually the worst thing would be that i drown , but i'm not supposed to think of that ! on the other hand , this is supposed to be the positive culmination of a lot of work it 's supposed to be a challenge not a punishment if i panic and get pulled from the water , it probably wo n't feel fun or be a positive experience even if i make it out of the water , will it have been fun if i was terrified ? once again , i do n't know i'm hoping to swim at least two more times before sunday , but i'm planning to make my decision by friday at the latest i do n't want to waffle right up until the race there would be no way to prepare myself if i did that i think i'm leaning toward waiting for another triathlon , but even as i type that statement the disappointment is enormous i guess secretly i'm hoping something miraculous happens this week realistically probably not , huh ? and yes , this is dragging me down , so in the end , i think i 'll be relieved no matter what i choose
