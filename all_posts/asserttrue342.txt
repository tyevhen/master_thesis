last night i was looking at the new weird , a collection of fiction , edited by ann and jeff vandermeer , and after reading a couple of stories and some essays in the book on the new weird , a variety of thoughts came to me about the state of fiction today not that anyone can claim to know the state of fiction today , of course , but that 's partly the point i should mention that my thoughts were also , in part , moved along by a huffpost review i happened to read last night by u wisc green bay professor harvey j kaye of josef joffe 's the myth of america 's decline professor kaye , who follows me on twitter , pointed me to the review it 's an excellent review , although i respectfully disagree with many assumptions in it and because the review was so excellent , i wo n't be reading joffe 's book now that i know how absurdly outmoded its assumptions are more of which , in a minute what all this got me to thinking about is where is fiction headed ? where is it now ? where should new writers of fiction consider going ? my first route to prying the lid off these questions was to try to get to the core of new weird which is an adventure in itself what is new weird ? why does it exist ? what audience need does it serve ? this turns out to be a difficult set of questions there is no new weird manifesto , no elevator pitch that reduces it to a neat logline , but the vandermeers say it 's a type of urban , secondary world fiction that subverts the romanticized ideas about place found in traditional fantasy , largely by choosing realistic , complex real world models as the jumping off point for creation of settings that may combine elements of both science fiction and fantasy in terms of signature works , china tom mi ville 's perdido street station is oft cited as prototypically new weird , along with works by m john harrison and even clive barker in terms of common elements , new weird seems to involve , more often than not , an alternate reality or alternate society optionally on an alternate planet with new rules of behavior optionally magical , but more often than not simply cultural and or state imposed , with characters that may or may not have special abilities or powers , special body modifications a la clive barker , special quests elaborate world building is thus a mainstay , a la tolkien in terms of basic storytelling , all the usual joseph campbell tropes hero 's quest , etc apply , along with common sense storytelling best practices as i survey the new weird landscape , i do n't see a whole lot new , honestly , so much as a tedious if admirably elaborate reskinning of the old weird , going back to poe and lovecraft , with heavy debts , also , to aldous huxley , kafka the metamorphosis , orwell , ellison , dick , and others the cultural reorganization of society along newweirdian lines that one sees in things like perdido street station or mi ville 's story jack , in the new weird feels , on some level , instantly stale to me but that only makes me more anxious to understand why it feels fresh to others the new weird is clearly an attempt to break out of the thematic tropes of mid twentieth century fiction , but it already feels stillborn in its quest to take tolkien in more phantasmagoric directions , precisely because of its slavish insistence on making characters behave in accordance with elaborate and supposedly fresh systems of rules cultural or state imposed less frequently self imposed in their new worlds the early and mid twentieth century fascination with the apparatus of bureacracy kafka , orwell , heller , pynchon seems to trudge on , in different clothing and in deeper mud , in the new weird in terms of success in breaking away from conventional thematic tropes and techniques , it strikes me that bizarro fiction with its frequent recourse to absurdism , surrealism , and proto dada grotesquerie comes much closer to missing the dart board where missing the dartboard is , in fact , the aim earlier i mentioned professor kaye and his incisive review , whither america , which speaks to the themes of grotesque nationalism my term , not his explored in josef joffe 's the myth of america 's decline the out of date sociological metrics by which joffe analyzes america 's policeman of the world and default culture my term status evoke in me the same frustration and , at times , abhorrence i feel with newweirdian fiction vis vis its slavish dependence on externally supplied and sometimes quite archaic and baroque sociological rule systems apparently the policeman of the world meme brutally and dangerously archaic as it is still resonates with certain nonfiction audiences the way kafka still resonates with fiction audiences , the latter being from my point of view far more comprehensible but in both domains fiction and soiological nonfiction , readers still harbor the hangover of nationalism , heard in the ever reverberating echoes of orwell and i think it serves modern audiences and the common literary weal ill to continue to pay homage to the dead bronze statues that so gravenly mark our progress in literature the story of the last thousand years in human history is largely the story of nationalism the aggregation of peoples and ideologies under state banners with messy borders crudely drawn in blood it 's thus in no way surprising that the vagaries of militarism and in peacetime the apparatus of control have so preoccupied the literary mind over this timeframe , with some of the most famous signposts in all of western literature having names like war and peace and gravity 's rainbow the latter denoting the parabolic arc of the v missile in wwii to be sure , fiction has also during this time produced significant tonnage of highly personal and psychological works , novels having more to do with issues of character and interpersonal dynamics and such works will always be relevant , because they cut quickly to the bare naked core of human existence , stripped of its geopolitical underwear , as it were but the question is why we cling so lovingly to the cold stiff corpse of state and or external authority as the controlling factor in characters' everyday worlds more particularly , why do we seek refuge in archaic feeling representations no matter how lovingly and elaborately permutated of externally validated rule systems ? externalism of this kind arguably reached its apotheosis in the matrix how many flavors of tolkien or frank herbert or kafka or orwell do we need , going forward ? systems of control are still relevant , but not imho as represented in the world building narratives of newweirdism or oldweirdism the current world is , in fact , much weirder than any of that already the systems of control of today are not explicit manifestations of state nor ideology they are far more subtle and dangerous , obtaining legitimacy directly from the suppressed and exploited that 's you , that 's me through their passive assent no law , no explicit form of coercion , makes you eat at mcdonalds or order , with your happy meal , more soda than the human stomach can reasonably process and yet america the superpower , america as default nation , along with most constitutional democracies in the world most countries templated on american politics , is happy to allow its citizenry to be obese , diabetic , sclerotic , and cancer prone no law explicitly requires you to buy chinese goods at walmart or for that matter to take a minimum wage job at walmart and yet your host nation has you wearing cheap foreign made clothing , and using foreign made electronics , while the underlying jobs not just grunt labor jobs but good jobs in technology are shipped out of the country no law requires you to go hungry in the greatest food exporting nation on earth , yet one in six americans requires food stamps to see more clearly the desolate bus stop on history 's joyride that we 've come to , it might help to roll back the tape and put your mind inside the head of a thomas paine , say , or a rousseau or voltaire suppose , in , as paine , you were to read a speculative fiction novel supposing such a thing existed at the time about a future nation state , the greatest country on earth , in which printing presses have largely disappeared recall that as late as , printing was the most prolific business type in america , pamphleteering has become obsolete , and citizens consume the majority of their reading matter by means of magical devices coupled to the great interconnector further suppose that although literacy has become universal , citizens of this strange future country spend a good time watching visual replicas of plays films , videos instead of reading , and the majority of citizens who choose to spend any time writing hundreds of millions worldwide are reduced to filing dispatches of only a few hundred characters at a time twitter and facebook updates now imagine that in this strange future world , people live to be instead of , and yet a third of the citizenry is sick with obesity related illnesses not just diabetes but heart disease and cancer fully a quarter of the population takes daily pills for high blood pressure , diabetes , or melancholia people are required by tithe laws to give a tenth of their income to the state , which spends a good deal of the money on foreign wars devoted to dubious goals goals that would not have been compehensible in paine 's day meanwhile , average citizens incur crushing debt to obtain an education , then are not hired for their knowledge or skills they obtain degrees in political science or philosophy or literature , but go to work for inconcceivably large corporations , doing incredibly menial things many of the jobs paying an unconscionably low minimum wage that has one in six persons dependent on public munificence for food these sorts of future world facts would have seemed absurd to anyone of paine 's generation what would have seemed most preposterous of all to paine , in particular , is the notion that huge masses of people would not be marching on their governments in revolt ! paine would have considered deeply troubling the geopolitical yardsticks by which a josef joffe measures a nation 's stature military budget , gnp , hegemonic domination of world politics , etc he would have identified strongly with measures of infant mortality , wellness , general happiness , opportunity he would have loathed the term upward mobility , however , poverty rates , hunger , incarceration rate all areas where america consistently ranks poorly to the extent that writers of fiction are envisioners of the future , or at least envisioners of alternate worlds , it seems to me we fail our readers if we tether our worldview to the soggy mire of militarism or nationalism in any of its guises given that the social milieu is an unseen main character in novels that build new worlds , it would seem appropriate to take stock of current control structures and build worlds that resonate with the issues that pertain to the modern inhabitants of those structures , many of whom have been brainwashed that slavery is freedom or vice versa , ignorance is strength , war is peace , etc by the old measures , america is still the greatest country on earth by any rational measure it 's arguably the most broken country on earth by buying into old notions we break fiction itself and render it a self parody society is evolving nationalism as a concept is fading the control structure conventions of yesteryear are like a once magnificent cake that 's been sitting all day in the rain why must we continue to eat from it ? it 's not enough for fiction to permutate and pervert the past and serve it up again in shocking colors serve us up something new if weirdness is a necessary ingredient , just look around as a reader of fiction , i want to move beyond tolkien in a party dress i want the next new weird to come without a rearview mirror the current new weird is n't doing it for me
