the beginning of november had me a little worried i had a difficult time performing my entire routine on wednesday , november my leg strength felt okay , but my arm strength was off i had to back off on the number of reps or used lighter weights in some routines even worse , afterward i felt weak normally , after my routine i feel pumped within a few hours i was aching , had chills and developed a cough i then realized i was coming down with something i had a terrible night with little sleep because of the constant coughing i rested thursday because i continued to feel weak and achy plus i still had a fever that friday i felt a little better so i decided to exercise i had a good , strong minute exercise , but i still could tell i was not fully recovered saturday i was feeling fine again other than that bug that i caught it has been another good month where i averaged minutes of exercises every other day and minutes on the light days i still have not noticed any side effects i am once again considering increasing some of my reps or adding more weights because some exercises have become quite easy i do not want to overdo it , however , because i remember what happened last spring with my over exuberance the neck weakness i experienced for about a week in may has not reoccurred thank you very much life continues to be good and i feel i made the right decision by beginning my own dutasteride trial
