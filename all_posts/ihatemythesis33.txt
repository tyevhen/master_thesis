this was one of my favorite poems as a child clearly , i liked it because i was psychic and knew that one day i would need encouragement while writing a master 's thesis i hope this poem helps you too melinda mae have you heard of tiny melinda mae , who ate a monstrous whale ? she thought she could , she said she would , so she started in right at the tail and everyone said , you 're much too small , but that did n't bother melinda at all , she took little bites and she chewed very slow , just like a little girl should and eighty nine years later she ate that whale because she said she would ! ! ! from where the sidewalk ends perhaps i have macaroni cheese taste in poetry , but shel silverstein is one of my favorite poets , and i was very sad when he died also , he wrote for playboy , so he ca n't be that bad ps i really hope it does n't take years to finish my thesis ps but if it does , i will still finish
