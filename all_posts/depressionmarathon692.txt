i'm not sure where to start or when to end this post has no title because that 's how i feel , title less there is nothing significant happening nor not happening life , right now , is just a series of events and i guess i'm taking them as they come , one at a time , but feeling little connection to nor passion for any of it it 's another side of depression , which highlights it is not yet gone i'm back home , sleeping in my own bed , but i'm still spending many hours per day at my friends' home i'm not totally okay in my own skin yet my mood is periodically fine , sometimes good , and often crummy my thinking is occasionally fine , sometimes good , and often crappy there seems no rhyme nor reason to it , although it does seem better when i'm busy i'm running miles yesterday and preparing for boston , which is now only days away am i excited ? i should be i'm neutral i'm not looking forward to it , nor am i worried about or dreading it it just is it just will be , at this point in time , another day , another run , another marathon and of course , i understand somewhere in my head that none of that is accurate it should mean more than all of that but right now , it does n't i finished my taxes , which is a big accomplishment , as they were hanging over my head i guess i might have felt a little relief when i hit the send button , but that 's about it i'm doing laundry , another chore that 's been waiting for me praying , i am , for the energy to finish what i 've started the dishes are done , but the vacuuming will have to wait soon , i 'll need a nap today 's bike workout is waiting as well i need to get it done , as i missed one workout already this week working those hour days last week was not conducive to exercising today 's mood is not conducive to getting on the bike , either i 'll have to force myself to do it maybe after my nap speaking of work , i 've got a very busy schedule again this week i guess my prayers for energy will be repeated multiple times in the upcoming days that 's it title less emotion less a series of loosely connected events life it just is this , too , is depression
