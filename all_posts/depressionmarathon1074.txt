yesterday was a big day it was the last day of my ' days of yoga' class we had a two hour , rather than the usual one hour session , from am i wanted to write about it yesterday , but i think i needed more time to process before setting it to words so here i am one day later , early morning , sipping my coffee before work , and wondering what the hell i am going to do without the structure of my yoga program ? besides the physical benefits to my body , the most influential piece of this journey was simply the structure structure that 's not a word i 've mingled with since depression snatched my life i'm sure many of you can relate the unpredictability of my illness , and maybe yours , too , does not lend itself to structure rather , structure is an expectation laden , frightful concept which i try to avoid that statement probably does n't resonate with normies , but if your illness is like my illness , you know what i mean it 's hard to plan for anything when one 's symptoms may change from day to day , or morning to afternoon , or as has happened to me occasionally , hour to hour ! doing anything for straight days was a minor miracle in my life the class was beautiful the sense of power and accomplishment among us was palpable like me , many of us suited up and showed up for all days we groaned , laughed , contemplated , sweat and cried together it was a intensely physical experience it was a mentally stimulating experience it was a rather deep spiritual experience our fearless leaders sent us on our way in style we danced to the music of kool and the gang celebration , of course ! we silently looked each and every other group member in the eyes in an uncomfortable , tear filled , intimate exercise we sang , we laughed and laughed some more words cannot express i am proud of myself for sticking it out i am proud to be associated with an employer who was willing to step outside the box and offer this experience i am humbled by and grateful to the women who organized the program i wish you all could have been there
