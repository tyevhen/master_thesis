photo by gio last night was one of those awful nights where i am dreaming of being rejected all night long i am not good enough to be around the people i want to be with and no one likes me , i m a social outcast etc i woke up feeling exhausted and sad it s amazing how much something that isn t real can affect your attitude so much as the day continued that i m not good enough feeling lingered and generally had me in a bad mood so i think to myself , i need to do something for me , for my self esteem so i started to think about what i do that makes me feel good about myself i thought , i haven t exercised for about a week , and i always feel better after doing yoga or a cardio workout i don t know why but i really like the biggest loser tv show , i guess it motivates me to try to live a healthier lifestyle the theme song says , what have you done today , to make you feel proud ? i was thinking about that question and thought , what a good thing to ask yourself everyday it could be something little like , eating an apple instead of the chocolate ice cream , or cooking a home cooked meal instead of eating fast food , or exploring your creativity and enhancing your talents anytime you feel proud about yourself , you have great self esteem so i want to do something everyday that will help boost my self esteem now although i am not in the race to lose pounds like the people on the biggest loser , i don t like my post baby body and would like to flatten and tone some things out so then i started to wonder about anxiety and obesity , and if there was any connection sure enough , the results of an nimh funded study show that nearly one out of four cases of obesity is associated with a mood or anxiety disorder , but the causal relationship and complex interplay between the two is still unclear the study is based on data compiled from the national comorbidity survey replication , a nationally representative , face to face household survey of , u s adults , conducted in it was published in the july , , issue of the archives of general psychiatry medicinenet com when i do a workout with the help of a tivo d episode on the fitness channel , the instructor s are always saying , don t give up , you deserve this , you are worth it ! so to sum up all this babbling , i think it goes to say that exercising isn t just good for our bodies , but its good for our minds as well our self esteem is so important in the role of anxiety and if exercising raises our self esteem i can only assume that would lead to a decrease in anxiety and depression you might also like how self esteem feels a quick update and other ramblings i'm being followed by a moon crater ! focusing on the negative only makes things more ugly linkwithin
