there 's a copy of the dsm iv sitting on my coffee table not the usual , not even at a shrink rapper 's house , but i'm trying to write the shrink rap book and , in theory , i may need to look something up so , kid looks at the dsm and informs me , we read that in english class today they read the dsm in english class ? hey in the good old days , we read macbeth in english class we did n't need psychiatric diagnostic manuals oh , why ? so they 're reading catcher in the rye and they decided to diagnose holden caufield interesting what 's he got ? oh , we shrinks do n't do that until i personally examine holden , i'm not venturing a guess as to his psychiatric diagnosis the apa and the medblogging community would have me de shrunked so what did the english class say ? they 're kids , they can venture guesses if they like one thought he had borderline personality disorder , some thought he had bipolar disorder , and a few thought he had schizophrenia funny , i was writing today about how hard it is to diffentiate developmental issues , family complexities , and psychiatric illness in adolescence seems like a funny coincidence well , what 's holden got ?
