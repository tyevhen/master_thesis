dear ab i read your books some years ago and today i again find so much refreshment and clarity in what you say i tried to understand and study non dual wisdom from east i think your work beautifully connects both the life of a person and awareness which we all are as one source the understanding how the brain works and how one thinks is very important and i think it is like a pre qualifiaction if we really want to re cognize who or what we are in the absolute sense i would like to ask you , if you also study or learn about the non dual wisdom advaita vedanta or self knowledge ? my second question is , why are humans so attracted to self centeredness and thinking about one self misery is so much easier than thinking a neutral thought ? i know it very well for myself and it looks i am just starting again from the start like you say , it is a good news that our brain has endless capacities for new neural acitivities i want to thank you for your effort you put in through writting and speaking the video on your website is amazing and gives us very important message with love from europe , dear with love from europe thank you so much for your letter i m happy that my work has been helpful to you to answer your first question i studied vedanta under dr alan anderson of san diego state university this great professor is no longer there but i began to understand what an unusual teacher he was when i realized that there were three members of the class that were quantum physicists who had traveled from los angeles to san diego three days a week for ten years to study under him they helped the class understand some of the eastern religion maxims in terms of quantum physics lately i have been studying the work of deepak chopra as to your second question the reason we are all so self centered is based upon our primitive survival instinct , our flight or fight response , which gives us increased energy in times of danger and which can also be triggered by other events than real danger we must not forget that the mind is basically a defense mechanism and therefore as paranoid as a secret service agent looking for something that might go wrong when the president is traveling it is our default mechanism when we are not engaged in other on purpose thinking activities when we allow ourselves to slip into accidental rather than on purpose thinking we can easily trigger the fight or flight response because it is always turned on and ready to defend us a b curtiss
