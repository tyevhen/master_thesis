i received my four year medallion at my home aa meeting this morning getting my medallion is always a great moment to reflect on what 's happened over the past year when i accepted my medallion , i mentioned ben , the young man i mentored for two years and who graduated this past june the support of my friends and sponsors , the lessons i 've learned from sponsees , and this blog without sobriety , i noted , i would n't have been able to mentor anyone , i would n't have had close friends , sponsors or sponsees with whom to share my life , and i certainly would n't have been able to maintain this blog afterward , it was this blog that seemed to create the most buzz within the room when i brought it up , i noted that my blog was about mental illness specifically depression and that like many , i am an alcoholic who also has mental illness if you 've been following along , you know i 've written about mental illness and addiction before unfortunately , too often i was prompted to write after an aa'er made an irresponsible or negative comment about mental illness here are a few of my favorite examples well if you just worked the steps better , you would n't have depression , or all psychiatrists are idiots , or if you 're in recovery , you should n't take any anti depressants thankfully , i did n't hear anything remotely resembling any of those comments today ! in fact , something very strange happened people started respectfully discussing mental illness among alcoholics ! to say i was pleasantly surprised by this development is an understatement ! i was shocked at least people asked me for my blog address another or members confided that they , too , had a mental illness and or took medication , and they thanked me for bringing it up but perhaps most remarkable was when one of our long term , male members who gave me permission to write this spoke directly about his own recent struggles it seems he 's been having some anxiety , suicidal thoughts , and general mental discomfort of late he talked about calling his doctor , taking meds , and his plan to see a therapist for the first time in his life after the meeting , he appeared to receive nothing but support from many of the men and women in the room i was honored and impressed with my aa group today it was n't that long ago when i felt the sting of stigma within this crowd one member told me to stop talking about my depression , as it had nothing to do with recovery , she said imagine that member telling a cancer sufferer that her cancer was not relevant to her recovery ! today things were different rather than stigma , i experienced respect and support i felt hope perhaps by not being silent the door today was opened perhaps by ignoring the ignorance , others felt comfortable not only to share but to support it was a big day , a dramatic day , for this mentally ill recovering alcoholic i hope my aa group will continue to honor all struggles among our diverse lot the door , it seems , is now ajar be open and honest about your struggles , my friends , you just never know what may happen perhaps you , too , will experience a great moment where support triumphs over stigma
