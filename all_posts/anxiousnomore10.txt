i have always been hesitant to start a facebook page because i did n't think many people would want to publicly join an anxiety page but i think its time i think the benefits can outweigh any doubts by joining the facebook page you can stay up to date with announcements , inspirational quotes and thoughts from your facebook news feed i do n't have time to spam you constantly so do n't worry about getting a storm of posts overtaking your page if you would like to join the facebook page you can view it here thanks and i look forward to sharing more conveniently with all of you ! update due to the request to make the page more private , i have had to switch from a page to a group this means that you have to ask to join and i will approve you this also means people can see the name of the group and who is a member , but cannot see what is posted without becoming a member too as always if you have any questions just let me know if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like adding twitter , facebook , and followers my redeeming moment on facebook check out the new discussion forum what is rss ? how to stay up to date with the reality of linkwithin
