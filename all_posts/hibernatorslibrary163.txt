in the past , there was an amazing amount of stigma against homosexuality king henry the viii of england declared the detestable and abominable vice of buggery a felony punishable by death it was not until that the maximum penalty in england was reduced to years in prison similarly , in , when lesbianism was about to be criminalized , queen victoria declared lesbianism to be impossible , and therefore there was no point in making a law against it in the us , the last law prohibiting homosexuality was struck down by the supreme court in as recently as , homosexuality was a diagnosable disorder in the dsm however , homosexuality was accepted in non western cultures for instance , in melanesia , which is a group of islands in the south pacific , a society called the sambia believe that semen is important for physical growth , strength , and spirituality they also believe that the body is only capable of creating a small amount of semen , so they must get the semen from elsewhere in order to maintain adequate semen levels , boys exchange semen through oral sex after puberty , the teens can penetrate the younger boys , thus providing them with semen as the teen ages , he transforms into a heterosexual , and ends sexual intercourse with boys after the birth of his first child melanesian children who refuse such practices are considered abnormal and are therefore very rare thankfully , western culture is beginning to accept homosexuality in the 's gay and lesbian people began to be more active for their rights such activist action led to increased brutality of police and homophobic citizens against homosexuals most recently , homosexual activity , although still highly stigmatized by some groups , is more widely accepted as within moral boundaries same sex marriages have become legal in all states despite the removal of much of the stigma against homosexual people , there is still a shocking amount of stigma against transgender transsexual people in fact , trans people are the minority most likely to be killed in the us as of october , transgender women have been killed in the us considering how rare trans people are in the us , these are shocking murder rates again , the stigma against trans people is most pronounced in western culture for instance , before being colonized by the british in the th century , transsexuals were revered as holy people who could remove the evil eye and bless homes and other places but with the british also came stigma now , transsexual women resort mainly to begging and prostitution i will review a documentary on this subject on saturday in the us , transsexuals must jump through many hoops and red tape in order be approved for surgery it is a several year long process the first step is to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria persistent discomfort about one 's biological sex , or the belief that one should be another sex gender dysphoria can be diagnosed in children if six of the following characteristics are met strong desire to be of another gender a strong preference for cross dressing in boys a strong preference for cross gender rolls a strong preference for toys , games , and activities associated with the opposite sex a strong preference for playmates of another gender in boys , a strong rejection of typically masculine toys and activities a strong dislike of one 's sexual anatomy a strong desire for the sex characteristics of the opposite gender generally , boys with gender dysphoria more often turn out to be homosexual than transexual however , the large majority of adults with gender dysphoria develop this characteristic as a child given that most children with gender dysphoria grow into emotionally healthy adults , there is some controversy about the inclusion of child gender dysphoria in the dsm in fact , when children with gender dysphoria are brought in for counselling , it is often the parents who receive the most counseling in adults , gender dysphoria can be diagnosed if two of the following traits are present an incongruence between the person 's sexual gender and his perceived gender a strong desire to be rid of one 's sex characteristics a strong desire for the sex characteristics of the opposite sex a strong desire to be of the other gender a strong desire to be treated as the other gender a strong conviction that one has feelings of the other gender after an adult is diagnosed with gender dysphoria , he must undergo years of therapy , including a year of living as the other sex only after all these years of hard work can the transsexual be approved by insurance for gender reassignment surgery disclaimer i apologize for the male or male female leaning of this post i'm making these posts to help me study for my
