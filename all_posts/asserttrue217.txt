when the human genome was sequenced in , the expectation was that scientists , armed with a powerful array of new genetic techniques , would very quickly identify the genetic correlates of things like schizophrenia , depression , autism , and alcoholism , which we supposedly know have a large genetic component extremely large , well funded genome wide association studies gwas were begun see this plos paper to learn how such studies are conducted surprisingly , the studies failed , for the most part , to converge on genes , gene copy number variants , snps single nucleotide polymorphisms , gene rearrangements , mutations , or other peculiarities of allelic architecture whose presence could predict important diseases when genetic loci of interest were found , the findings often did n't replicate in followup studies or if they did , the relative odds ratios a measure of the ability of genetic features to predict the prevalence of a trait fell far short of explaining the known magnitudes of various traits in target populations if things like schizophrenia and alcoholism truly do have a strong genetic basis as we 've been told , and if they were to involve tractable numbers of genes say , dozens or scores of genes , rather than hundreds or thousands , dna studies of the gwas kind should produce immediate , strong , recognizable genetic signatures of disease the results should leap off the page but they do n't time and again , the very few candidate alleles that are found are either found in low numbers , or have low penetrance low capacity to predict disease , or both , and quite often the candidate alleles that are found are not confirmed by followup studies this has given rise to major crisis in genetics , summed up in a paper called finding the missing heritability of complex diseases that appeared in nature in scientists are desperate to explain the missing heratibility of disorders we know are genetic it 's assumed , by most scientists , that the failure of genome wide association studies to find genetic explanations of complex diseases can be attributed to such studies' low power and resolution for genetic variations of modest effect so the quest has begun to increase the study size of future trials , in hopes of seeing more robust results in addition , there 's a reasonable expectation that many complex diseases will doubtless be found to involve numerous genes , each contributing only a small effect to the total it 's also been suggested that some traits are dictated by extremely rare genetic features with high penetrance there 's also an awareness that current laboratory techniques have low power to detect gene gene interactions what no scientist wants to say , however and what none of the co authors of the nature article above would say is that maybe the genetic components of schizophrenia , alcoholism , depression , etc are simply vanishingly small to begin with yet that 's exactly what the data are telling us but we wo n't listen to the data because it does n't fit our preconception of how the world should work we know that a person 's height is largely controlled by genes studies going back almost a century have determined that body height is to heritable no one seriously questions this fact height is heritable it runs in families however , at least three large , modern genetic studies have been done to find height genes the largest involved over , study subjects and co authors in all , some genetic loci were identified that play a role in determining a person 's height but the genomic features , put together , accounted for only of observed variations in height the rest appears to be environment are we now supposed to enlarge our study population from , to several million , in order to find the genetic explanation for body height , just because we know one exists ? at some point , do n't we have to just admit the data 's the data ? should n't we be willing at least provisionally to entertain the idea that maybe the twin studies and the data showing that certain things run in families pre gwas era data , mostly are in need of reevaluation ? should n't we at least consider the idea that prior studies misjudged the importance of uncontrolled for environmental variables ? now that we have powerful dna analytic techniques for investigating heritability , and the techniques are n't giving us the results we want , must we increase the size of the microscopic to make the results look bigger ? or should n't we just accept what the data are telling us as painful as that may be ? in a future post , i 'll talk about some of the gwas results for alcoholism stay tuned this post is , in part , derived from material for a forthcoming book on mental illness i'm writing please come back often to find out how to get free sample chapters
