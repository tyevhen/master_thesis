over the past couple of days , i 've been blogging a fair amount about mozilla rhino one of the surprising to me things about rhino is how much faster it is on its own i e , when you include js jar in your classpath than when you use the rhino based scripting engine that comes embedded in the jre see previous blog in the past few days i 've also been spending a lot of time with apache sling imagine my relief to find that apache sling uses rhino proper js jar version r rather than relying on the jre 's onboard scripting engine this means server side ecmascript runs much faster in sling than it otherwise would but sling 's use of rhino r is a big win in another way as well it turns out r is the first rhino build to feature onboard support for ex the ecmascript extensions for xml , otherwise known as ecma rhino has had ex support for some time , but until recently it 's been a patched on kind of support relying on the external xbean jar which was originally created by bea , in pre oracle days prior to rhino r , you had to have xbean jar in your classpath in order to have ex support now it 's built in no more need for xbean jar so it turns out you can use ex grammar in your server side scripts for sling , which , i gotta say , is a huge turn on if you 're as big a geek as i am i 'll be blogging more about ex in sling in coming days at dev day com in the meantime , i thought i 'd leave you with a quick example of what you can do with ex on the server side recently , i ran into a situation where i had the following bit of markup in an esp server side ecmascript file fields field name director value currentnode director value field field name genre value currentnode genre value field field name language value currentnode language value field field name movie value currentnode movie value field field name released value currentnode released value field field name runtime value currentnode runtime value field field name starring value currentnode starring value field field name writers value currentnode writers value field fields now mind you , there 's absolutely nothing wrong with having markup that looks like this in an esp file it 's fine as is but if you 're an xml scripting geek , you see a situation like this and you inevitably start looking at ways to roll up all this verbosity into or lines of ex and sure enough , this is what i came up with fields fields names movie , director , genre , language , released , runtime , starring , writers for var i i names length i field field value currentnode names i value field field name names i fields field fields toxmlstring concise to a fault arguably , it 's not as readable as the fully unrolled markup particularly if you 're not a scriptomaniac , but if you 're well versed in ex , it 's perfectly clear what 's going on , and it shortens the esp file to where all code fits on one screen without scrolling always a good thing , in my book as i say , i 'll be writing more about this sort of thing on dev day com soon watch that space in the meantime , if you 're new to ex , i recommend taking a look at this article on ibm 's developerworks site it 'll get you up to speed quickly
