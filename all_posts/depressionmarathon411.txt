i do not have much to report tonight i am still quite ill in fact , i may head to the doctor tomorrow if things do n't improve i have worked all week , but it has n't been fun or easy i have little to no voice , which is comical when trying to communicate with my elderly patients who generally do not hear well anyway i'm looking forward to my day off tomorrow i plan to rest , rest and rest some more other than this viral illness , the rest of my body recovered very well from the marathon i had little soreness and could have easily resumed running within days i have n't run yet , but it 's been due to my chest congestion rather than sore muscles i'm looking forward to getting back on the road , but i 'll hang out until this virus clears first it 's now time for me to head back to bed sleep seems to be the best thing i can do right now hopefully i 'll be feeling better and have a little more to say when we visit again in a few days
