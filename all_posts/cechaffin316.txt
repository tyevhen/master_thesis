i wrote the seller on amazon who was asking for my first book of poems , elementary she informed me that amazon had made a listing mistake , that she did n't have the book and knew nothing about it i suspected this from the first too happily i embraced an illusion without proper research good news should be questioned , bad news is likely true although the book now lists for from mellen press , the home page of the publisher states that it 's out of print i 've tried this before but i tried it again i ordered a copy through amazon , who wrongly thinks it available later they will inform me that the book is out of print , which i already know , and credit me with a refund if it is available i will be shocked why i care about it is obvious it 's the only tangible proof i was actually an author i continue to resist self publishing , although of books are self published nowadays my gig at the lavender festival went well though the crowds were sparse i was well received here 's a picture pat jones took of me while i was playing i 'll be your baby tonight by bobby dylan later i got to play on an actual raised stage the wine and food were good , as they were yesterday when i acted as a volunteer guide for the digging dog nursery tour , where i was able to answer a few questions as a master gardener about plants , but mainly pointed people in the direction of the wine and food afterwards i started sliding into a depression , as i was trying to get by for two days on one capsule of my antidepressant again , hoping the order from canada would arrive before i had to pay fifty dollars for ten more pills one mg capsule is the recommended maximum dose , to be fair , but i know i require mg so i messed up again yes , virginia , this doctor patient is that stupid luckily the medications came in the mail today , so i got my proper dose and hope the miasma of despair will soon clear and relapse will be prevented , provided the generic capsules from india are not bogus funny how they smell of curry truly , managing my mental illness is the most important task in my life but like other humans , if i feel well for even a little while i begin to forget why and risk foolish liberties i should have refilled my local rx saturday when i was first forced to reduce the dose there 's no fool like an old fool there 's no poet like an ex poet i sent a query to the publisher of my poetry book about a second book , but they no longer publish poetry so i sent another query about my book on eliot and they said to send it but in my depressive mode , upon reviewing my third draft of the book , i found it awful they will never publish it it is literary criticism in no man 's land , somewhere between an academic treatise and an undergraduate student 's hypertrophied term paper and the prose style is much too dry i had hoped to engage readers , but it bores me to death can it be fixed ? probably not will i try ? probably because it 's work , and that 's what i need , even if it 's pointless consider it a basket weaving class at a mental hospital also , in signing up for a local writer 's conference , in my depressive state , i had a great deal of trouble making decisions as to what to attend poetry ? prose ? memoirs ? publishing ? fiction ? non fiction ? as i have unpublished books of poetry and prose , fiction and non fiction , i do n't know where to go mostly i just checked anything to do with agents or publishers in my present mental state it would n't matter if i published a bestseller nothing will help except improved brain chemistry i hope the indian medications work if they are defective i'm screwed no wait i'm not i just have to pay for the brand name in that case see ? i can still think somewhat rationally let my boulder of sorrow be a grain of sand suddenly at kilorats , ce
