when you 've been in and out of the hospital five times in less than days , and experienced depths of despair never before thought possible , and when previous successful treatments failed to relieve the pain , what do you do when you wake up feeling low , lethargic , and unmotivated ? of course , i am the person who 's been in and out of the hospital , experienced the despair , and went through the failed treatments and i am the one who woke up this morning with that uneasy feeling of a do over right around the corner what to do ? what to do ? it 's difficult not to be frightened by the slightest dip in my mood right now it 's difficult to ignore that uneasy feeling you know the one , that feeling in the pit of your stomach that some thing 's just a bit off it 's the same feeling you 've had many times before , right before a crash i tried to explain that feeling to my friend and my doctor 's nurse today , but if you 've dealt with depression , i'm betting no explanation is necessary i'm trying not to put too much stock in the feelings , acknowledge them and move on , but i 'd be lying if i said i was n't nervous i awoke feeling low low is okay i can deal with low without much thought or concern but low combined with the lethargy , fatigue , and lack of motivation to do anything other than pull the covers over my head ? that , my friends , is a different story i 'd like to know how you deal with it ? i'm just coming out of this dark , soul sucking , hopeless abyss the last thing i want to feel now is how i'm feeling today likely my feelings today mean nothing healing is not linear i know that it 's likely just another day in my recovery process , and that 's what i'm hanging onto right now i 've acknowledged the feelings i 've noted the dread surrounding the feelings i took the next right action anyway i went to my appointment , ran my errand , and even accomplished my scheduled run none of it came easily each task required a conscious decision and an effort not normally necessary for such tasks i'm glad i pushed through , but i pray tomorrow i wo n't have to
