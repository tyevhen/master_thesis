this is a short post to send you over to clinical psychiatry news where i wrote an article on an nfl com television special a football life special about brandon marshall , the chicago bears wide receiver , who struggles with borderline personality disorder it 's not often that i get to write about football and psychiatry in the same post , and i always like it when successful people are public about their psychiatric disorders what better to help de stigmatize conditions that are erroneously associated with people who have been marginalized ?
