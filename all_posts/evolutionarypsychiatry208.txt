in my last post on endocannabinoids , i was trying to do a little too much with too little time , and i do n't think the science came out too clearly today i thought i would use the excellent kim et al paper again for a quick summary of what is known about the effects of the endocannabinoids on obesity , both in the central nervous system my usual bailiwick and peripherally also , please check out beth 's post over at weight maven she has diagrams too ! endocannabinoid aea will activate the cannabis receptors in the brain and in the fat tissue and skeletal muscle the response is to increase food intake , possibly by increasing the appetite hormone ghrelin aea is found at higher levels in obese individuals than lean individuals , and seems to promote fat storage in the muscle , it decreases glucose uptake , which is one way to increase insulin resistance the other major human endocannabinoid , ag , also increases food intake , and is also found at higher levels in obese individuals the amount of ag you have circulating in your body is positively correlated with how much body fat you have , and inversely related to insulin sensitivity it also decreases glucose uptake in the muscle cck is a hormone secreted from the intestines when we eat normally it sends a signal to the brain telling us that yes , indeed , we have eaten , and we can back off with the hunger signals already aea and ag at higher levels seem to interfere with this whole signaling process and , once again , higher levels of aea and ag are found in obese individuals leptin is a hormone that acts in the hypothalamus of the brain when it is working normally , leptin sends a signal that we have fed and we need to not be hungry anymore however , obese individuals often have high leptin levels , suggesting that the brains of obese individuals have become resistant to leptin 's effects leptin resistant mice have increased levels of endocannabinoids swimming around in their plump mouse bodies in mice born without the ability to make leptin , treatment with leptin will very quickly lower endocannabinoid levels so obviously there is cross talk and regulation that somehow becomes broken in the case of obesity so omega fatty acids become endocannabinoids , which are associated with increase fat tissue , decreased insulin sensitivity , and leptin resistance oops ! but keep in mind we only have the associated with there , not the smoking gun it 's just such a pretty theory , i ca n't help but squee a little kim et al are very pro omega fatty acid , suggesting that it will help reduce obesity , reduce endocannabinoid signaling , and increase insulin sensitivity they do use the work of william lands to suggest that an increase of dietary omega pufa was more efficient in decreasing eicosanoid formation from omega derivatives than decreasing omega pufa in the diet eicosanoids are the bioactive molecules , such as prostaglandins , endocannabinoids , and thromboxane , that are made from omega and omega fatty acids i just downloaded and took a gander at the lands paper referenced , and the whole time the good dr lands talks about how the current of us and denmark diets of omega pufa is too high , and increasing the total ratio of omega to omega pufa is the reasonable way to go it seems that in systems that are deficient in omega , we will hungrily gobble up the omega , so that is perhaps what kim et al means by an increase of omega was more efficient that decreasing omega pufas in the diet but who knows what they were thinking very interesting quote from the lands article about fish , however a fatal hypersensitivity to environmental stimuli fainting shock syndrome is exhibited by rainbow trout that are fed diets containing n fatty acids without sufficient counterbalancing amounts of n fatty acids fainting shock syndrome ! wow if you are a rainbow trout , do not eat corn oil enough said
