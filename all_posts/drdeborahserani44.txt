during my morning surf for psychology stories , i came across this one at the bbc asking is it ever right for a therapist to cry ? i wondered as i sipped my english breakfast tea a perfect coincidence why this was a worthy subject the bbc felt needed covering surely , people know that therapists cry especially if a patient 's narrative is moving , upsetting or emotionally tragic right ? the article , though , reported that some patients were surprised that a therapist might tear up in a session , finding the response off putting and even unprofessional the bbc article brought into view a recent study by san diego psychologist amy blume marcovici , psyd , who wrote that approximately of the psychologists surveyed cried at least once while with a patient of these psychologists , had cried within the past four weeks this data did n't surprise me , being a trained psychoanalyst empathic attunement and countertransference are but a few of the psychoanalytic principles i 've spent hundreds of hours studying as a training analyst , experiencing as a practicing therapist and writing about as an author a lot of multitasking goes on in therapy as a therapist , you listen deeply with your patients , index your own thoughts and feelings as they talk , register what threads to grab to explore further , and dwell in the experience of it all as it unfolds in real time sometimes , a patient 's narrative moves you sometimes it takes your breath away other narratives may upset you , make you laugh or raise a sense of worry , just to name a few whatever the emotional response , therapists are trained to deal with them in productive ways for the patient being treated sometimes therapists may share them , sometimes not but when they do , it 's with the intention of sharing a genuine experience to empathize , connect and validate tearing up while bearing witness to a patient 's unimaginable loss or a painful memory is not a rare event for me because i specialize in depression and trauma , i often work with individuals who have endured unimaginable events as my patients and i work in sessions toward recovery , i consider the range of all my emotional responses to be an integral part of the therapeutic process and so does research while many think it 's unprofessional that a therapist cries , being emotionally open is often just what a patient needs from a therapist so , the answer to the question of is it right for a therapist to cry , is a resounding , yes
