i 've mentioned previously in passing that i think one of the benefits of unschooling is in the space it gives people to learn to handle things at their own pace but i do n't think i 've ever said more on the subject than that so here 's me saying more i think unschooling helps people to grow up as more emotionally healthy people , in part by giving them the opportunity to not deal with shit when they ca n't handle it i think it 's important for people to have the option to avoid things when that feels like the healthy thing to do what i mean by this is , for example , what i often did growing up struggling with anxiety when a place or an activity or a person just made me too anxious , i could choose not to go back to that place or activity for as long as it took me to no longer feel anxious about it whether that was a week or two or forever for others , it could mean not having to continuously deal with places or social groups where they 're bullied , or things that feel too overwhelming non schoolers of various stripes are often accused of sheltering their kids , and while the type of sheltering that includes no sex ed and only teaching creationism might be problematic , the type of sheltering i favour is that of children learning to protect themselves by not dealing with more than they 're capable of handling being able to make that call , instead of having no choice but to go to a place every single day where you might feel extremely overwhelmed and anxious , depressed , or be bullied and abused , is powerful i'm so grateful for that i 'd like to think i'm happily avoiding things that made me anxious by practicing keyboard here then of course you get a whole bunch of people saying then how will they ever learn to deal with difficult situations ? ! my response is that , firstly , why should anyone be subjected to harm , whether that 's physical or emotional , if it can in any way be avoided ? and secondly , that difficult situations and people are simply impossible to avoid no matter how sheltered a person is what you can do is not deal with actual abuse no one , no matter their age , should ever be forced to deal with abusive people and situations ever wait until you feel ready to deal with something maybe it 's impossible to avoid , but you need a bit of time to think things through , and prepare yourself everyone deserves that breathing space , if they need it avoid the things that just are n't necessary maybe a certain activity is full of people who just love drama maybe you do n't feel it 's worth it to go to that activity , because it provides more negatives then positives in your life so you can just , you know , stop going because ultimately , difficult things are impossible to entirely or sometimes even mostly avoid your friend groups will have fights and issues , you 'll have to support your friend who 's going through something really rough , relationships will end , you 'll run into abusive people , and sometimes you 'll feel that you have to deal with an environment that feels really toxic but what unschooling can do is let you avoid some of the worst situations and some of the unnecessary ones it gives children and teens a lot of the same freedom adults have , to quit a job with an abusive boss or stop going to that quilting class where people keep talking behind other peoples' backs i think that children and teens , when given that freedom , ca n't help but be at least a bit healthier , happier , and better equipped to deal with difficulties in more intentional ways and really , is n't that what we should all be striving for ?
