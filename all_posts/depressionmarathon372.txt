i'm not feeling very wordy this evening i had my eighth ect treatment today i'm still recovering my mood continues to challenge , although i did have a slight reprieve over the weekend d came to visit this weekend we had n't seen each other since labor day weekend it was really nice to see him while it was great to spend time together again , d being here also increased my stress just a bit d is trying hard to understand what 's happening with me , but he freely admits he does n't know anything about depression in fact , some of you may remember he disappeared a few years ago while i was being treated for a depression exacerbation with that in mind , i thought this exacerbation might lead to the end of our relationship , but so far he 's hanging in there in between running together , and a movie , and dinner with friends , d and i did chat a little bit about my illness i tried to educate him without overwhelming or terrifying him it 's hard he 's not around for the daily grind he does n't see me day in and day out nevertheless , he appears to be hanging in there he 's trying to understand the illness and working to comprehend the treatment , especially ect i appreciated his willingness to ask questions and learn after my ect treatment today , i received a text message from one of my coworkers it was a coworker from whom i never would have expected a text he said all of my coworkers were thinking about me and hoped i 'd be back soon that was really nice i miss work i miss my patients i miss my coworkers i feel totally useless yet i know i'm in no condition to work as much as i 'd like to , i know work is not an option today still , it was nice to hear from my coworkers hopefully , if the ect does the job it 's supposed to do , i 'll soon be back doing the job i'm meant to do helping the patients i'm meant to help i continue to pray for relief from my depression symptoms so that all of the above will be possible sooner rather than later i 'll take any spare prayers from any of you , too
