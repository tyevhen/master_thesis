i am not someone who believes that my children are just differently abled maybe someday , if they reach a point where i don t watch them continuously struggle to live in this world of ours , i will have a different perspective , but right now , for the most part i see confusion , fear , anger and frustration and i worry and worry and worry some more , about their futures every single thing we do , every single day is challenging take getting both boys in the car to take nate to school in the morning the minute we turn on the car , jack starts in with , mom , you will turn the radio off when you take nate in right ? he sits in the car for about minutes each morning while i take nate in don t judge , it s a private safe parking lot the one time i forgot to turn the radio off , he rolled down the window and screamed like a maniac until i came out to turn off the radio he even liked the song , it was just the concept that the next song might bother him if there is traffic , he screams and says he wants me to drive through the cars if i turn to go a different way to avoid traffic , nate screams because i have deviated from the routine so i am saying , little things in life are a big deal for us if jack could finally master buckling his seatbelt i might bust out into a chorus of hallelujah ! no , seriously so when we face a week like last week school parties , social events , trick or treating it can look pretty overwhelming to say the least jack is somewhat used to the routine these days he had his issues with anxiety he cried if i moved more than a step away from him at the cisco center party because he was afraid i was going to leave him there since he stays there sometimes , he yelled an awful lot during trick or treating inappropriate yelling like i don t want that candy , give me two , or if they re not home i ll shoot but he made it we went with a largish group of friends and family and he did a pretty good job for him halloween with nathan in the past has been hellish his first halloween was fine other than another upper respiratory infection and a considerable number of nebs that day the next year was just awful i remember my mother in law turning to me at one point and asking , is he ever happy ? that is kind of seared into my memory mainly because it was one of the first times i realized how miserable he was but only when we took him out of his usual environment he cried the entire time , and one of us had to bring him home after a few houses he had always been my laid back , easy going kiddo this happened right after his initial diagnosis it was a whole new ballgame the next year i didn t even attempt a costume i got him an owl winter hat and bought a cape on etsy , the least invasive thing i could think of you can see , this wasn t a big hit either not sure how far he made it that year kinda blocked that one out last year , what can i say ? the boy loved his costume did he trick or treat ? no but he did sit in his stroller and tolerate the other kids trick or treating the year before , every time the stroller stopped he went into a meltdown last year , he pretty much hung out he definitely had no concept of what we were doing , but he was ok with it this year was amazing ! nathan was an active participant in all things halloween it was like a two week extravaganza of tangible progress holidays often make progress seem more obvious , since it is easier to recall what nate was doing on that exact date last year , more so than just any other day he picked a pumpkin at the pumpkin patch , he petted the animals at the petting zoo when i showed up at his school i planned his school party he was nothing but happy to see me content to stay and participate in class , no meltdowns halloween was definitely the highlight though after school , we first went to trunk or treat at cisco center , which if you have never seen it cars line up with their trunks facing the same way , they decorate their trunks and hand out treats to the kids as they walk from car to car nate was stopping with jack at each car next i looked and he was choosing an item independently i found something with mickey mouse on it , and he was super happy he finished that , participated in the party inside actually did better than his big brother , and then we went home to get ready for trick or treating i brought the stroller i had no idea what to expect from him this year , but if i have learned one thing in the past years , it s that it is much better to prepare for the meltdown and have a way to contain him , than to wing it and hope for the best kind of like taking an umbrella on a cloudy day and he did use the stroller once he was tired but first he trick or treated with the other kids for a solid hour now , either mommy or daddy held his hand , and walked to the door with him , and he didn t say trick or treat although i swear he tried a few times , but he did stop at each door , he did physically reach and pick a treat each time , and he did put it in his bag and he would say bye bye when i told him to and me ? i spent the entire evening in tears , and probably annoying the crap out of all of our neighbors , friends , and nate s grandparents did you see that ? ? he did it again ! i can t believe it ! i almost can t stand it it makes me so happy he was calm , he was engaged , and he was interested in what was going on this is not a small thing this is a huge thing it was amazing , and one of the best days i can remember in a long time so while i can t say at this point in my boys lives that i consider autism a gift , as some other parents express , i can say that friday was a gift , and it was one that i wouldn t have appreciated nearly as much if autism was not a part of our lives
