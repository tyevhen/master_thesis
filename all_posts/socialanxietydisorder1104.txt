i do have two tattoos but i actually like them and don t want them removed but i saw this add for a tattoo fade system called wreckingbalm has anyone used it and does it work ? just wondering because , i really have my doubts according to what we have all heard on how hard it is to remove tattoos ! answer i have a friend who used it , and it just faded hers out it definitely did not remove it but all she wanted to do was fade it so she could get a cover up i guess it depends on what you want it for question what is the best thing you have ever used to fade freckles or age spots ? answer retin a works extremely well at fading spots , and clearing up acne as well however , you need a prescription for it from a dermatologist and it is kind of expensive on average , around for small tube that tube will last you about two months , and it takes about months before you see a difference the results can be dramatic however good luck to you ! question has anyone used porcelana fade cream , how well is it and does it work quick ? i heard about this cream from a previous question i asked and was wondering how good it is and if he works quickly by this i mean a couple of weeks or days not years feel free to be as honest as you want on your opinion of this cream answer anyway , my mother introduced me to porcelanas fade dark spots nighttime treatment skin lightening cream it is just as the name suggests , you use it at night it is said to fade dark spots so i gave it a shot well , all you have to do is wash your face throughly and apply a small amount of the porcelana fade dark spots nighttime treatment skin lightening cream to the dark spot on your face for as long as it is needed i used it for about a month and saw some magnificent results you need to use it every night well i did anyway to see the results quickly ! i was very happy to have these one or two random dark spots disappear from my face ! porcelana fade dark spots nighttime treatment skin lightening cream comes in a small oz tub and has a nice scent to it so it is pleasant to apply unlike some other lotions i have encountered before ! and it lasts very long because you only need to apply a very small and thin layer of the cream to the spot that is bugging you only ! on the tub says it can also be used for other skin discolorations such as age spots and liver spots , freckles and pigments in the skin that may occur in pregnancy or from the use of oral contraception well i dont know much about the last one frankly but i simply use it for dark pimple spots ! i still keep a bottle of porcelanas fade dark spots nighttime treatment skin lightening cream around for if i ever need it , which i do need at times i have to admit , on the bottle said it would discolour after a while of being exposed to air all the time which is quite true it turned from white to a very light maple like brown colour but is does not reduce the effectiveness of the cream at all ! i have to say that i count my lucky stars that i dont always have to deal with these dark spots caused by pimples well popping them anyway ! i would definitely recommend porcelana fade dark spots nighttime treatment skin lightening cream to any of my friends ! xo
