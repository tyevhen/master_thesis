there 's a funny smell and a constant tickling sensation in my nose i 've broken free of the template , i'm no longer ticking my way through life 's objectives of passing through various levels of education , seeking an internship , graduating and getting a 'proper grown up job' i 've found myself singing to my own tune , driving along my racing line and cooking without a recipe i do n't have any secure plans for my future , i'm engaged but that does n't mean i'm going to be a wife any time soon we 're creating a life along our own time line , making decisions when problems or opportunities arise i seem to have a discussion with various individuals every couple of months or so , it sounds something like this i grew up a certain way , i lived with two supportive and extremely hard working parents who wanted the best for my brother and i i 'd say that i come from a working class background , i know how to 'muck in' and i know what hard work looks and feels like i 've always seen myself having an alternative type of career , i'm not seeking the mega money pay cheques and i do n't want to live to work i choose to work to live my life or at least that 's the idea i used to see myself working in a creative role from a young age i wanted to be an artist , i 'd draw until my pencils were teeny stubs and until my felt tips were exhausted and could only wheeze out ghostly bits of ink onto a page however , as i grew up i realised how hard it would be to live in that way , it would be hard to carry out an independent life if i could n't sell artwork to pay the bills i 've always said that the foundation art and design course felt alien to me , spending hours cutting up bits for a random collage and using up an entire biro for a doodle did n't feel like art to me the teachers loved it ! when i looked around at the other students there , they seemed so enthusiastic , they looked the part and seemed to live and breathe art i did n't feel like i wanted it enough , so how could i be an artist ? i can remember being quite smug when i sat in the library revising for a levels , i only had to worry about getting fairly decent grades for the foundation course whereas my friends were fretting about ucas points and conditional university offers i never foresaw ending up at university i'm glad i did , i do n't regret any decision i 've made so far as its got me to this point in my life i may be weighed down by depression and anxiety sometimes but it is n't constant , i do have a very good life i'm incredibly fortunate for what i have and that i'm in the position where i can take the time to heal myself after a lot of years of self neglect its got to the time of year where i'm becoming surrounded by people that are heading off to 'grown up jobs' , they 're graduating as undergraduates or finishing phds , heading off on summer internships or starting their year in the workplace of course its an exciting time for them and i'm happy for their successes however , its quite unsettling for me once again i will have the conversation about where i am in life i'm hanging out in 'gap year' limbo , i'm focusing on my health , fitness and happiness i'm making rugs , writing , rearing a puppy , growing sunflowers and entertaining a hamster i belittle those things , when i compare my position to others ask me any other day and i 'll be proud of those achievements , seriously check out my sunflower plants , look at the stem on that beasty ! but the doubts do creep in and i do find myself asking whether its ok if i end up being a housewife or if i never have a stable career the answer is always 'yes' and that the support will be there i 've started to realise that perhaps i'm the one that has a problem with it why should i be able to have a cushy life ? but the sociologist , and feminist in me says that it will still be hard , staying at home is n't easy and there has to be someone to fill the creative roles in the world i'm struggling to make the transition in my mind , i 've gone from living with two hard working role models and believing that i 'd live the same way , to considering a very different lifestyle neither choice is bad , some of us need more structure in our lives whilst others prefer to be able to drift towards a more unstable but free lifestyle , go where the mood takes them and accept any exciting and interesting opportunity that comes their way whichever way i end up living , i 'll never see money as a measure of success , happiness on the other hand
