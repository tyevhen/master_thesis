i'm sorry for the long delay in posting this week i have finally recovered from my illness i'm spending this weekend with d at the lake it has been an unbelievably gorgeous weekend the sun has been shining non stop , and the temperatures have been in the 's the leaves are beautiful , and the smell of fall fills the air this is exactly what i needed not only is the weather beautiful , things with d are going great we 've spent a lot of quality time together it 's so great that we like to do the same things yesterday we returned to the bike trail in the woods , the trail on which we met , and went for a long bike ride we stopped a few times and took some pictures , chatted with a few other folks on the trail , and generally had a lovely time together after dinner last night we did n't want to come inside , so we built a fire and sat quietly under the stars before retiring for the night this morning , the lake was like glass , so we set out in the kayaks for a journey around some islands again , it was beautiful we took our time , took more pictures , and soaked in the sun like i said , this is exactly what i needed this weekend i'm happy i return home tomorrow to prepare for my surgery tuesday really ca n't come soon enough i'm so ready to get this thing taken care of i'm anxious , of course , as i wo n't know until i wake up from surgery what kind of recovery to expect the unknown is always scary but i'm optimistic everything will work out as it should , and i will be back running soon enough i'm trying to combat my worry with faith any prayers you may offer will certainly be appreciated
