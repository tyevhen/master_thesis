growing up as a child who was emotionally neglected or abused is a very painful experience and has emotional consequences when that child becomes an adult whether this is due to narcissistic parents who were so self involved that they were not attuned to the child or for other similar reasons , it is a lonely and hurtful experience overcoming the effects of childhood trauma many adults who grew up emotionally neglected or abused as children feel inadequate or like there 's something wrong with them they often feel flawed and that they 're not lovable one blog post cannot possibly do justice to such an enormous topic there are many forms of emotional abuse and neglect the following short vignettes , which are not about any one particular person , are representative of some forms of emotional abuse or neglect betty when betty was a young child between the ages of her parents would often leave her alone at home so they could go bar hopping with friends she was very afraid of being home alone , which is normal for a young child , and she would beg them not to leave her but her parents would dismiss her concerns , telling her she was being ridiculous and calling her a cry baby as

attracted to highly narcissistic men who were unable to take her emotional needs into account in all of this fictionalized brief vignettes we can see the damaging effects of being a child who was not seen or heard by parents under optimal circumstances , parents who are emotionally attuned to their children see their children as individuals with their own emotional needs emotionally attuned parents can take in their children 's feelings with empathy and understanding of course , this does n't mean that they should give their children everything that they want without regard for whether it 's good for them it means that they can set aside their own concerns for a while to understand their children 's concerns there are times when parents might want to be empathetic and understanding but , due to life circumstances beyond their control , they 're unable to for instance , if a single mother has no choice but to work long hours to support her children , and she 's not around to be nurturing , the children can feel emotionally neglected edward after edward 's father left the household when edward was years old , his mother had to take on three jobs just to make ends meet edward
