academic writing is famous for verbose , clumsy prose in an earlier post , i showed how such prose can cost you a nobel prize it 's amazing to me how far scientists and others will go to obfuscate their own findings it starts while you 're a grad student i recently came across the following paragraph in the rough draft of somebody 's master 's thesis in psychology cultural differences are pervasive phenomena that affect individual s cognitive processes the presence of cultural similarities and differences across individuals can be accessed through psychological processes such as logic , perception , attention , and communication the application of these psychological processes shape the way in which individuals think and how they make decisions the first sentence seems to be saying that cultural differences extend to the level of individual thought , which is so obviously true imho that it does n't need to be stated there 's also a mechanical mistake individual 's should be individuals' the second sentence seems to say that cultural differences can be assessed not accessed along dimensions of logic , perception , attention , and communication i'm not sure how you assess these things how do you assess communication ? what does communication or for that matter attention mean here ? the author needs to add specificity to the sentence and cite references in the appropriate places , so that if the reader finds a concept obscure , he or she can consult a more detailed explanation elsewhere the third sentence is a mouthful fortunately , it 's an active voice sentence with a predicate of shape but what 's the subject of the sentence ? apparently it 's the application of these psychological processes that 's a clumsy subject for any sentence and it 's singular , not plural therefore the verb should be shapes , not shape it 's also illogical how do you apply psychological processes of logic , perception , attention , and communication ? it does n't even make sense suppose we simplify the third sentence to such processes shape the ways individuals think and how they make decisions is n't it already obvious even to a non specialist that logic , perception , etc shape the way a person thinks ? the sentence tells us nothing , really to me , the entire paragraph is useless it says nothing useful rather than polish it , the author should junk it and move on later in the same thesis , we encounter decision making is a function of practice , motivation and cultural beliefs the ability to resolve conflict is extremely valuable when dealing with intercultural disputes therefore , when an individual is presented with an opportunity to resolve a conflict , that individual will rely upon past experience , the motivation to make the resolution and behaviors techniques their culture will promote or deem as acceptable socially appropriate behavior the first sentence is vague and just plain weird , semantically the second sentence is self evident and needs to be cut the third sentence begins with therefore when i see therefore , i expect the next statement to be logical consequence of whatever was said before that 's not the case here at least , it 's not the case with regard to past experience there needs to be a comma after resolution the phrase acceptable socially appropriate behavior does n't need acceptable after behaviors techniques , we encounter the pronoun they , which refers to the previous individual insert loud buzzing sound wrong a plural pronoun does not go with a singular individual the paragraph says nothing new , as far as i can tell it needs to be trashed the takeaway when you restate academic gobbledygook in simplest form , you sometimes find there 's no there there which means the author was n't thinking clearly to keep yourself from falling into this trap , always start by simplifying even oversimplifying what you 're trying to say say it in plain language then , if it needs elaboration , go back and expand some of the ideas , but do n't try to cram too much into a single sentence break it up multiple short sentences are always easier to understand than a single long sentence also , be ruthlessly honest in your judgment of a paragraph if it 's junk , junk it do n't waste time polishing a turd
