ever since i was a young boy in th grade , i have loved erasable ink pens i never connected that love with my adhd before , but recent evidence has shown me they re inseparable when i was younger , i didn t so much write as much as i skipped , crashed , and tumbled with a pen across the page somehow my attempts at cursive would drop a letter or add an extra loop depending on how distracted or excited i was at the moment my writing was filled with crossed out mistakes as well as corrections squeezed in on the tops and sides it was a mess then heaven sent me erasermates suddenly , i could correct my constant mistakes in penmanship i used erasermates all through junior high and high school by the end of high school , however , i had switched from cursive to printed letters in all caps it was slower , but it was also less prone to error even then the erasable pen was my pen of choice i lived with the smeary ink and the blue pinky finger because i knew the trade off was worth it i could correct my constant typos and goofs mistakes g o r e galore you know the kind complete sentences written only in your head , but somehow left off the paper writing music lyrics or snippets of conversation from around you accidentally into your prose dropped words complete changes of subject that ripped the readers brain in a angle away from the point my written page was an exercise in literary torture an erasable pen was like magic for those moments i could scrub away my mistakes and leave only a ghostly smear to mark their existence by the early s i was doing everything on computer , so programs with autosave and undo were my new miracles but i still needed the ability to erase my written mistakes when my kids entered school i tried to share my excitement with them about erasable ink , but the oldest two had no interest then my third daughter took to them like a viral video on facebook curiously , she also had mild adhd she discovered she loved erasable ink for all the same reasons i did fortunately for her , there is a veritable cornucopia of erasable pens on the market these days this is a boon for you , too there is the traditional erasermate , available in inexpensive disposable packs downside smeary , sometimes faint and oily , and always somewhat erasable upside inexpensive , available in four colors , and always somewhat erasable erases the easiest there is the more upscale eraser max , but harder to find and still disposable unlike the fancy erasermate pens of my youth with their pen eraser refills downside same as above , and difficult to find in america upside nicer heft last year sharpie came out with their liquid pencil , which was simply an erasable ink pen i tried them out for art and found them useful downside clumpy faint can scrape up its own line when laying down heavy line , and loose pen cap drives me mad requires a few strokes to erase , so the eraser goes fast comes in only black upside feels nice in the hand , lays a good , fine line , and the ink is permanent after a while the newest kid on the block is by pilot it s called the frixion pen with an erasable gel ink , and it s my new favorite unfortunately , it s completely targeted to kids because of the pseudo tribal tat designs on the barrel i d prefer something with the cool look of their g limited series , but beggars can t be choosers like most gel inks , the frixion is very smeary until it dries about seconds , but unlike its competitors , it lays down a very thick , solid line once set , it doesn t smear , it doesn t clump , but it can still be erased , either with the rubber nub on the barrel or any solid object friction makes the ink rub away no worries about running out of erasers what a miracle downside kiddie style barrel , very wet when first laid down , requires the most effort to erase upside wonderfully , thick line , indiscernible from other regular gel ink , when dry it erases completely , doesn t need an eraser to be erased , comes in six colors i never connected my love for erasable ink pens with my adhd until i noticed how my third daughter took to the pens as i did at her age if you have adhd , i recommend having a few of these on hand for those times you need to write something on paper , but are concerned about making mistakes that get noticed now if only somebody made an eraser for all those times i opened my mouth in public follow me on twitter for my adhd escapades at splinteredmind or my novel writing over at douglascootey and if you 're a glutton for punishment you can friend me on facebook as well
