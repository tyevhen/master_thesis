i think this is my favorite post ever or excerpt at least i am not someone who runs in a big group , in my life i have felt lucky if i take one significant friendship from each experience these are all people who i could pick up the phone and talk to at the drop of the hat , and it would feel like no time had passed i could text them an expletive out of nowhere and with no context and expect to get one right back ! these are true connections age , beliefs , occupations do n't matter one of my best friends is hehe , lives in wisconsin and i have met her face to face exactly three times in the years we have known each other when i do see her i feel like i need to put up a partition so we can have a proper conversation establishing this type of friendship is a huge emotional risk but obtaining it is one of the biggest blessings in life there have been times when i have given to the point of hurting myself , times when i have been really hurt by those i have risked caring for but the times when i have been rewarded with true , lasting friendship have far outnumbered these and so i will continue putting myself out there life is too short to risk missing out on someone who could turn out to be very important to me will i continue to get hurt ? without question but i will know who my true friends are when the going gets tough true friends are there no matter what it 's a tough lesson , and one that i have learned the hard way many times i want to take a moment to acknowledge the fact that i have learned quite a bit about true friendship this year about being a true friend , and recognizing true friendship versus convenience or manipulation i have often acted naively in my life for the most part , when it comes to friendship , i choose this i want to believe the best in people i'm actually quite frequently right but i have also been duped at times the difficulties in my life over the past year have really clarified in my mind who i can trust , and who i ca n't if you give your trust to a person who does not deserve it , you actually give him the power to destroy you this is a lesson i seem destined to learn over and over again ahhh the good old days you know , april i was complaining on facebook the other day about how much gray hair i have acquired this year it ai n't pretty and i am horrible about keeping up with my roots , so i am starting to resemble a skunk at times whatever i feel like many of the above statements are false i am not a good judge of character and i am no longer willing to take huge emotional risks they are n't worth it i no longer choose to act naively , it hurts too much my significant friendships they are the only ones i need i do n't want to be hurt anymore i want to be with my family and the friends that matter i want to continue to grow as a person , and i want some peace so do not be surprised if i turn a bit hermitish for awhile sometimes we all need to take a few deeps breaths , step back , and reassess our lives make the conscious decision to remove ourselves from situations that are out of our control or unhealthy for us i feel selfish doing this , but it 's not just for me , it 's for my sons , and my husband , and the life that we continue to rebuild i have come to realize that i can be a little miss fix it to a fault that i went to help others with their problems so much that i ignore my own or maybe it is so i can ignore my own , that 's anyone 's guess some of this is compassion , but a lot of it also stems from insecurity , the need for others' approval today i am taking a stand on my own , and my family 's behalf from this moment forward , my life is about us other people are going to continue to have their problems will i be there for my true friends in the way i always have been ? of course i love you all too much , and you have been there for me this past year , and i will never ever forget that however , today i do solemnly vow that i will not insert myself into conflicts that do not directly involve me i will not try to fix every wounded person i meet it wo n't work , and often it makes things worse i will not continue relationships that are hurtful or harmful to me i will focus on the people who have surrounded me with love and support in my difficult times , and give them as much as i can this is my life and i am so , incredibly lucky i never want to take my family , or the love we have for each other for granted never is a pretty big word , but that is my goal yes , today is actually a bad day but bad days happen , and then they are over and when i wake up tomorrow , i will have a do over i am going to make the most of it
