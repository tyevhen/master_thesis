things are going well i'm feeling fairly good i'm probably not back to normal yet , but i'm much closer than i was i have occasional intrusive thoughts which creep into my brain , but today those thoughts are more annoying than they are frightening or worrisome so things are moving along the one symptom i am still struggling with is fatigue i'm flat out sleepy ! i'm making it through work , but i sleep for at least an hour immediately after i get home i spend many hours sleeping , after i finish running , on my days off fatigue always seems to be one of my lingering symptoms , so this is nothing new , but i 'll be happy when it passes other than that , i have little to report i'm in the first week of my three week taper for my upcoming marathon i had a great workout yesterday , and i'm generally feeling ready to go i think it 's going to be a long three weeks i'm anxious to get to the starting line that 's it for now , my friends i'm living life on life 's terms , and right now the living is getting a little easier i'm very grateful for that
