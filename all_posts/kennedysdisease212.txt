yesterday i received the following comment from mike thanks for your inspiration bruce i have 'enjoyed' an 'arrested' degeneration for the last couple of years and unfortunately got my hopes up that i was n't going to get any worse unfortunately , i have begun to get worse again while the last few years i was able to get around pretty well with just a cane a few hundreds yards between rests i'm now finding it difficult to go feet i 've also had to finally put a seat in my shower and use my power chair more than before just when i started to really feel sorry for myself , i found your blog and your writing has given me a renewed sense of 'worth' that is so helpful in coping with kd thank you and keep up the great work as soon as i read mike s comment , i knew that my next blog topic would address the dirty , nasty , sinister side of kennedy s disease that is , by the time you get comfortable with your current state of progression , you are once again challenged this is also a reason i regularly write about my ongoing battle with acceptance in the upper right column of this page is a brief explanation of where i am in my journey life is a succession of lessons which must be lived to be understood each step challenge is a life experience and i must come to terms with that experience regain my balance accept my new current condition before being able to take the next step move on with my life it is a slow and often challenging journey , but i am finding it very fulfilling acceptance is what i am working on today for without it , i will never be able to take the next step at times , it almost seems like kennedy s disease is a sentient being that loves to play tricks on me unfortunately , it is all tricks and there are no treats let me explain what i mean i wonder how many times over the years i have said to myself , okay , i can live with this ? yes , acceptance whew , i finally made it then , wham ! it pulls the rug out from beneath my feet and gives me another new challenge to contend with it almost seems like this entity kennedy s disease is lurking in the background , watching and waiting for me to finally come to terms with my latest and greatest loss of capabilities before launching itself at me once again unfortunately , there is nothing i can do about it i have to pick myself up , dust myself off , and begin working on acceptance all over again frustrating you bet ! discouraging yes ! inevitable without a doubt , yes ! this ongoing battle is just another part of the process of learning to live with kennedy s disease so , my journey continues
