i got out of the hospital yesterday my sponsor picked me up from the hospital , and then we picked up puck from her house , and then we all came home oh my god ! i am totally overwhelmed being home totally overwhelmed ! i have n't been in my house since just after christmas my home feels sterile and unlived in there are over days of bills piled on my kitchen table nothing feels like my own everything feels foreign and confusing i am a bit confused after all , ect effectively erases memory , and mine seems to be gone it 's difficult to describe , but i feel like a fish out of water in my own home it 's very unsettling i 've spent too much time crying my eyes out since i 've been home , and right now i just want to curl up and cry some more i do n't know how i'm going to come through this i'm so overwhelmed , and i feel so inept i do n't even know where to start this illness has torn me down to the quick i'm raw and exposed raw and exposed
