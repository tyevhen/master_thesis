having severe anxiety can make every day challenging some days i have so much anxiety bubbling away in my stomach i can barely leave the house but some days i have a bit more energy and feel like i can have a little adventure , albeit to the corner shop ! i 've recently started driving again , i had n't driven since i passed my test years ago so i was pretty nervous the area i'm living in at the moment is n't very familiar to me either , so it is n't as easy as driving the roads i know well around my hometown the factors of a new car to get used to , unfamiliar roads and a driver that is as nervous as a bag of frogs new phrase i heard recently all adds up to create an anxiety fuelled situation i headed out for my first drive with a friend , and as expected i stalled a couple of times but in the middle of a road leaving a junction it was a horrific experience which left me shaken , with a massive lump in my throat and unable to talk thankfully my passenger was happy to get out in the middle of the road and take over in the drivers seat i got home and had to shut myself down in a dark room for an hour or so to cry it out , it was a terrifying first drive which left me feeling like there was no way i could do it again and it felt like my newly found independence was slipping away already thankfully my second outing came along sooner than i thought it would this time i was driven to some quiet roads that i could practice on without fear of too many pedestrians watching and very little traffic it was very nearly another miserable experience as i was continuously stalling but my lovely mother in law to be came up with a genius and initially frightening technique roar ! she screamed at me from the passenger seat , she told me that i ca n't be afraid of the car , i am its master and i must make it roar it was a brilliant method , and i was ready to sharpie roar across my knuckles for my first solo drive !
