as i 've mentioned before , i'm in a bit of an awkward place right now because i withdrew from college after attending for three years living in a place where the majority of the population has at least a bachelor 's degree , this can be kind of , well , frowned upon i feel like there is an invisible clock over my head ticking down the time i have before i go back to school i guess the problem comes in where i do n't really want to go back to school i know to society that makes me look lazy , but i decided to withdraw because i thought it was better to take a step back and examine what i really wanted in life before finishing and i wanted to wait until i was really ready to put my all into my schoolwork so i'm not just wasting my time and my parents' money it does n't seem wise to go to school just because you feel like you have to if you are going to just scrape by so i guess i 've been trying to accept the place where i am i may not be doing anything valid in others' eyes , but i am trying to build skills on my own that i had always neglected because i was trying to focus on school art , communication in relationships , self reflection , self expression letting myself come up with crazy ideas for future ambitions life is a process and even great minds need a period of development problem is , we 're always pushing ourselves to accomplish things now , get famous young , finish in three years instead of four , etc meanwhile , i think about many of my friends who are in school still and how few of them really have their heart in what they 're doing they 're all hard working people and they are managing good grades , but i never met anyone who really had a passion for learning and doing school while i was at college everyone acted like they 'd rather be anywhere else doing anything else dorm room door whiteboards boasted countdowns to upcoming breaks why keep trying to shove a square tube through a circular hole ? and spending , to do it ? most of us do n't even know what it is we want to do for work being home , i 've realized how interested i am in entrepreneurship i always kept as far away from business classes as possible because i never considered myself skilled in that area , but taking time to dream and scheme has made me reconsider the use of business classes should i go back to school beyond the practical use of time off , i'm proud of myself for making a decision that was best for me and my health i know that 's not the first thing that comes to mind when people make a judgment on someone dropping out of school , but it was a major factor in my decision and it is n't easy to decide to buck tradition and put your own wellbeing first but i'm glad i did , and i hope i continue to wisely consider my life path instead of succumbing to the pressure to scramble to follow a certain expected life trajectory
