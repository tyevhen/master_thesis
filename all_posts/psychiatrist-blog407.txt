so , i 've been taking a little break while clinkshrink posts about the aapl conference i always enjoy hearing about what she 's learned there we both had the pleasure of being in the sky last weekend as we awaited the arrival of hurricane sandy , though my flight , the only one heading to the east coast from milwaukee that was not cancelled , did not include unscheduled stops in the wrong part of the country clink and i were both pleased to get home , and even more pleased that our region was spared the brunt of the storm in , a large tree fell on my house during tropical storm floyd , and i 've never liked storms since then if there 's a post traumatic tree disorder , i have it so seaside height , new jersey is a place i remember from my childhood the day i got my drivers' license , i drove two miles to a friend 's house she and another friend jumped into the car and said , let 's go to the beach now i had been a licensed driver for six hours , and we did n't live near the beach no , i said , too far oh , come on why not we drove to seaside heights , played games on the boardwalk , and drove home no cell phones back then i dropped my friends off and returned home around in the morning no laws requiring midnight curfews back then , either i walked in and my mother greeted me with , i was so worried , i thought you 'd been caught in a flash flood flash flood ? what flood ? it rained , i said she stopped and said , where were you ? ah , obviously someplace where it had n't rained i like that memory and i do n't like seeing photos of the rides in the water to all those who are still feeling the effects of the storm , our hearts go out to you
