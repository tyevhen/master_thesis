the last few days have been a bit difficult for the first time ever i am relieved for it to be monday , i need the work distraction i wrote the below towards the end of last week when i was in a better frame of mind reading over it though has picked me up that 's always a good thing i 've been single again nearly two months i actually feel quite good sometimes i feel strong , but obviously sometimes i'm the absolute opposite a lot has changed for me in the last couple of months i 've moved house , i 've lost a bunch of friends , i 've become a cat mummy and i 've lost lbs losing weight has massively helped me feel better about myself i feel a bit like my year old self and she was really fun she was fresh out of uni and fresh out of a messy relationship she did n't worry about a boyfriend or the future i like to channel her sometimes as much as i want to eventually be in a relationship and build a life with someone , i realise how lucky i am to have so many friends to share things with and so many friends i know will always be there for me at the moment i would prefer to put my trust in them as opposed to some boy it 's a much safer bet i am determined to date soon , i would quite like to get dating again asap to be honest if only for the free wine i will approach dating just as i have in the past , one date at a time i definitely do not want to get carried away into another mess , i want to make sure i keep my heart all mine i'm not at all ready to trust it to somebody else i 've learnt quite a few things over the last couple of months i'm definitely learning how to deal with my anxiety better , i'm living in the moment much more and realising i do not need to let my feelings have so much control over my actions of course i sometimes wonder about the future but i cannot let myself worry about that too much i 've been far too busy tackling my broken heart to even have the time to think about the future to be honest
