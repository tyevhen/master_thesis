being thankful is a full time challenge when i was building my life back up following my divorce i spent a lot of time thinking about all the things i was thankful for it was tough those days were very dark and finding a sliver of hope needed work photo courtesy of nurture store ten years later i find it easy to be thankful every day each evening my children and i sit down to dinner and we go around the table asking what our best and worst things are of that day this is also a wonderful way to find out what 's going with your family i 've discovered test results and arguments with friends this way teens can be so guarded ! they feel safe to voice their concerns as part of their 'worst' bit and we can discuss it as a family we then turn this into a positive by saying what our 'best' thing was this could be a simple as a sunny day or as monumental as an a exam result journaling is one of my favourite self help tools , and jotting down three things you are thankful for can do so much for your well being i write my list just before bed last night i wrote meeting a friend for coffee spending the evening snuggled up with my kids watching telly my new patio had landscapers in all week what happens if you are having a tough time though ? how can you be thankful when your life is full of pain , anxiety or debt ? this is when writing a journal can help even after the darkest of days you will be able to find something to make you smile the smell of a cup of coffee , your pet dog wagging his tail when you get home because he 's pleased to see you what about a stranger holding open a door for you , or finding a five pound note in an old coat ? do n't think that you can only be thankful for the life saving brain surgery obviously you would be ! ! but instead remember the smallest of things words , smiles , sunny days or friendly actions they all count in my life i see my past as something that happened to another person i got a 'do over' and everything that i 've achieved since has been my new life this new person who was re born and started fresh has created her own happiness , built on her strengths and learnt huge lessons about her weaknesses to be able to move forward i began setting myself goals smaller ones to begin with the first goal i ever set myself was to get up , get dressed and take the kids to nursery and school that was an amazing day ! i began my 'be thankful' journey that same day what are three things you are thankful for ?
