a number of months ago , i had a massage it was very relaxing and my massage therapist suggested i take a bath with some special salts later that evening to remove the toxins in the lull of the moment , i spent on a paper bag full off bath salts i used some once , but the truth is , i prefer bubbles recently , there 's been a lot of talk about bath salts in the news , a staff member at the hopkins press asked if i could talk on bath salts and cannibalism and i must say , i was completely confused i 've finally figured out that bath salts have nothing to do with massages or baths tubs as i'm sorting this out , i thought i would share with you what i'm learning so bath salts are the street name for a mostly legal drug now banned in some states , denmark , the czech republic , or sweden named methylenedioxypyrovalerone mdpv mdpv can be purchased in gas stations and head shops on the website for the national institute for drug abuse , director nora volkow , m d wrote last year these drugs are typically administered orally , by inhalation , or by injection , with the worst outcomes apparently associated with snorting or intravenous administration mephedrone is of particular concern because , according to the united kingdom experience , it presents a high risk for overdose these chemicals act in the brain like stimulant drugs indeed they are sometimes touted as cocaine substitutes thus they present a high abuse and addiction liability consistent with this notion , these products have been reported to trigger intense cravings not unlike those experienced by methamphetamine users , and clinical reports from other countries appear to corroborate their addictiveness they can also confer a high risk for other medical adverse effects some of these may be linked to the fact that , beyond their known psychoactive ingredients , the contents of bath salts are largely unknown , which makes the practice of abusing them , by any route , that much more dangerous unfortunately , bath salts have already been linked to an alarming number of er visits across the country doctors and clinicians at u s poison centers have indicated that ingesting or snorting bath salts containing synthetic stimulants can cause chest pains , increased blood pressure , increased heart rate , agitation , hallucinations , extreme paranoia , and delusions the ingestion of bath salts is associated with raising body temperature , which may lead users to take their clothes off it was speculated that the man who was found naked and eating the face of another man on a florida highway may have been using bath salts , though the latest of googled articles states that this was not the case in any case , the bath salts in the tub are different from the stuff in the news stick with the tub stuff , the mdpv variety seem to be doing nothing good and are very dangerous and yes , i 'd love to hear your bath salt stories
