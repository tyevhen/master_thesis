i awoke at am , as planned , to a flash of lightning outside my window uh oh today 's weather forecast called for a chance of thunderstorms well , i thought , maybe it 's better in lacrosse by the time my friend arrived at am , it was thundering , lightning , and absolutely pouring buckets of rain this should be interesting , i thought we began our drive east , but the weather not only did not improve , it got much , much worse the rain was coming down so hard it was difficult to drive one hour into our journey , about miles from lacrosse , it began to hail we pulled under an overpass , checked the race website , but still no word regarding the status of the race the hail stopped we pushed on ten minutes later , they called it the marathon was cancelled disappointed , we turned around as my friend drove away in her car , i wondered what the hell i was going to do after all , i totally carbo loaded yesterday i had to exercise ! but i was so disappointed and discombobulated , i just wanted to lie down ten minutes later , on my way to lying on the floor with puck , i called my friend , maureen , back she had just arrived at her home in the country rather than lie down , as i really wanted to do , i got back into my car , drove to her house , and we ran miles together i feel better now now i can lie down ! what a weird morning we were all geared up to run miles then all the air was sucked from our sails then there we were , running down the road anyway i'm glad i called maureen back , and i'm really glad i ran long rather than lying down i know i 'd feel really crappy right now if i would have given in to the disappointment and just slept instead , i feel satisfied i'm still disappointed , but i'm satisfied running saved me once again instead of dwelling on this missed opportunity , maureen and i decided to sign up for the local marathon , which will be run here in three weeks on may th we laughed as we made this decision because we both did boston in the heat , and today we got cancelled because of lightning and hail , so we figure we 're due for some really pristine weather at our next event ! let 's hope it is so
