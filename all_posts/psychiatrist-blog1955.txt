this post is not about suicide suicide is an important topic and there 's been some good discussion here , but frankly it 's getting to me a bit i went out to dinner last night with a friend who had to identify her brother 's body ten days after he killed himself then she had to clean up his blood soaked room then we had a suicide in our neighborhood a week or so ago , and my neighbor still has n't been able to return to the house so as far as the blog topic goes , my final word would be just do n't do it with apologies to nike it 's a freakingly mean thing to do to your loved ones and friends and now for something completely different i'm going to pose a problem to our readers and ask for advice how 's that for a switch ? actually , i just needed an excuse to try out our new polling feature here 's the situation i went to the bank this past saturday it 's a rather small branch , and on weekends it 's crowded on this particular day the line for the teller curved around the perimeter of the lobby where two people were waiting to see a banker the first person was a middle aged woman and a young man with peach fuzz cheeks for future reference , peach fuzz man the woman was talking to peach fuzz as he tapped on his pda he appeared to be looking something up i was n't paying much attention until i heard peach fuzz say the phrase , you definitely meet dsm at that point my ears pricked up like harold the vampire cat in front of a humming bird but without the jumping at the window part i heard some more mumbling and then i heard peach fuzz state quite authoritatively , you need a full cardiac workup now , by this point i'm somewhere between amazed and aghast every physician has been in a social situation where someone asks for clinical advice after they find out what you do for a living i generally say something about not discussing individual cases in public , or i 'll talk about a diagnosis in general terms without reference to any particular individual details i think this situation takes the case as far as lack of privacy goes i have no doubt that every person standing in line heard as much of that conversation as i did i'm making a lot of assumptions here , i know i'm assuming they did n't know each other before they came to the bank , and that during casual conversation the woman found out what peach fuzz did for a living and asked for professional advice i'm assuming peach fuzz has some medical training , although what happened sounded more like medical student or intern behavior then again , there are faculty physicians around here these days who look pretty bambi ish so there 's the situation my question for the blog is , what would you do if you heard a doctor discussing this woman 's case in public ? unfortunately the poll does n't let me ask questions about the voter , because i 'd love to know if people had different advice based on whether they were health care providers or patients regardless , give it a shot and then see how others voted take my poll
