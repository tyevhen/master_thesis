i do n't think i believe in laziness in fact , i'm almost certain i do n't in my imagination , i hear countless people gasp in shock and horror what do you mean laziness is n't a thing ? look around you , there are lazy people everywhere ! what i do believe is that a lot of people have a lot of really lousy ideas about what types of people are lazy and what laziness looks like in our consumerist , capitalist , and highly competitive society , productivity here being defined as the participation in monetary work in an economy built on a model of endless growth is valued above pretty much everything else , and if you 're not either a working most of your waking hours for pay or b in school preparing to be working most of your waking hours for pay , you 're probably just being lazy people like to talk about kids being lazy a lot lazy because they 're doing badly in school , or playing too much , or not doing their homework , or getting really stressed by school and common wisdom says that kids are too lazy to do hard things like learning on their own terms , which is a frequent criticism unschoolers get from relatives , strangers , and random people on the internet i 'd like to argue that whenever people see something they 'd label as lazy , it 's really one of these other things they 're seeing instead people who are struggling , or even in crisis people with disabilities , mental illnesses , and chronic illnesses chronic pain are very , very familiar with being considered lazy lazy because they 're not performing up to the standards of normal , healthy people , and if they just tried harder , thought more positively , and pulled themselves up by the bootstraps , they could surely do better any children in school , who are learning or not in a high stress environment , with regular evaluations , and the threat of failing grades leading to summer school or even having to repeat a grade , are in a difficult enough position as it is add in the struggle of a disability or illness of some sort , and you 're expecting the impossible you 're expecting someone to thrive in an environment and a lifestyle that they 're literally incapable of coping with then on top of that , they get called lazy , and blamed for the failings of a system that was not built for them they get to feel worthless and like a failure , like they should be able to do better , even if they ca n't though it 's compounded in children with physical or emotional difficulties , the reality that school is the problem not the student holds true for those without any illnesses or disabilities , as well schools were n't built to be a nurturing , flexible environment in tune with how children naturally learn and grow , so it should n't come as too much of a surprise that a large portion of children struggle in such an institution people who feel lost , directionless , and unenthusiastic sometimes , even if someone is n't struggling in a major way , a way that could actually end up being a diagnosable illness , they 're still not doing so well maybe they have trouble getting excited about learning or doing anything much , they 're stressed out and uncertain about what they want to do or how they want to do it this means they need people to help them figure things out , find some new pursuits , make any necessary changes to their environment , set some goals that feel good to the learner , or otherwise offer a supportive presence and helping hand what someone who feels lost and uncertain does n't need is to be made to feel guilty about those feelings , and like really they 're just being lazy people who like to daydream , and whose learning is largely more internal and less visible in our culture there 's a common idea of what learning is supposed to look like children who are learning are supposed to look diligent , hard at work , focused , and possibly like they 're not having too good a time everyone learns in ways that do n't look like learning at least some of the time , but especially for some young learners , learning can be a very internal , non structured process , involving lots of daydreaming and quiet time playing , thinking , and imagining this is n't laziness , just learning in ways that schools do n't tend to value people who learn in more active , energetic , kinesthetic ways , through play and exploration this very much overlaps with the above this is yet another learning preference that is largely ignored in school , to great detriment for many active , enthusiastic kids there 's also a tendency for adults to think that kids who are just running around playing all the time are having way too much fun to actually be learning this , of course , is not at all true , and luckily there 's more and more research showing the importance of play for children and adults people with a sense of entitlement i'm leery about the word entitlement , simply because it 's so often lobbed at people in the same way lazy is , and for the same reasons i do n't think it 's entitled to expect respectful treatment access to food , water , healthcare and shelter experiences that bring you joy support when you 're having trouble and a place in the world those are human rights , not something entitled millennials or children or name the group are unreasonably demanding however , i do think a sense of entitlement exists , in people who believe that they 're more deserving of good things than others , who believe that by virtue of their birth or wealth or other attributes they 're better than others , or that they do n't have a duty to be generally polite and kind to those around them basically , there are people who do n't ever go out of their way to do anything for other people , and that 's really entitlement right there but do n't call it laziness name it for what it is a sense of superiority and lack of caring for others people who call themselves lazy sometimes okay , for many of us , often we really want to do something , and yet we do n't start doing it we start something , and then avoid doing it for weeks we procrastinate endlessly then that little voice starts in our heads , i guess i'm just lazy well , i do n't think you are i do n't think i am i think it 's more likely either one of the above struggles either big or small , a favoured learning style that does n't look productive , or perhaps most often fear fear of failure , fear you 're not smart enough or good enough to be doing what you want to do , fear of ridicule or criticism laziness might not exist , but fear most definitely does i also find myself wanting to ask , is doing nothing really so bad ? must we constantly be engaging in something productive ? why ca n't we just relax , without having to justify whatever we 're doing to either ourselves or others ? something does n't have to be a learning experience to be worthwhile once we move past some puritanical or maybe more capitalistic mindset of having to be constantly engaged in something appropriately useful , we can really work on embracing all life has to offer , whether it 's useful to the economy or not i do n't want to dissect the episode of veronica mars i just watched for any learning potential , i just want to enjoy it , and enjoy the discussions with my sister it sparks on the characters and plot and what we think might happen next learning is always happening , whether we 're noticing it or not but more importantly , just living , just existing and enjoying and working and playing and yes , learning , is enough we do n't have to justify our very existence by being productive just being is good enough this is why i always wince when i hear the word lazy passing anyone 's lips it 's demeaning , it further hurts children who are already struggling , makes people feel guilty and worthless , and just creates a horrible environment to live in , never mind for positive learning and growth learning happens best when people feel supported and challenged , not when they feel stressed and insecure , with people watching them in disapproval and muttering about laziness if adults really care about learning , then they need to work on being more supportive and less critical , and erase the word lazy from their vocabulary , and the false concept of laziness from their minds then we can all get down to the joyful business of life learning a little bit easier a big thanks to nikki and ashley for kindly offering their copy editing skills and making this post read better than it otherwise would have !
