i noted in today 's northern star that dr diana kraft , northern illinois university 's psychiatrist for years , has retired after being told she must cut back on the amount of time she spends evaluating patients the side bar in the paper indicates on march , kraft was notified by her supervisor that the time allotted for her to see patients would be reduced from minutes for a new patient to minutes , and minutes for a return patient down to minutes incorporating paperwork and dictation , kraft would only be allotted minutes of face time for a new patient and minutes for a return patient , she said i hate it when administrators see patient care as an assembly line which can get speeded up when demand or profits require more efficient widget production people are not widgets
