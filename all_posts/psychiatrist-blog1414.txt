a podcast listener asked us to talk about managing patients with borderline personality disorder ugh i do n't want to talk about it instead , i'm going to talk about why i hate the term , why i rarely place it in writing , why i wish it would go away okay , the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder is probably a perfectly valid diagnosis if you read roy 's post about the differential diagnosis of chloe o'brians personality disorder from , you 'll see the following diagnostic criteria borderline personality disorder a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships , self image and affects , as well as marked impulsivity , beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts , with many of the following features frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment such as lying , stealing , temper tantrums , etc not including suicidal or self mutilating behavior covered in criterion a pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation identity disturbance markedly and persistently unstable self image or sense of self impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self damaging e g , promiscuous sex , eating disorders , substance abuse , reckless driving , overspending , stealing , binge eating again , not including suicidal or self mutilating behavior covered in criterion recurrent suicidal behavior , gestures , threats , or self mutilating behavior affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood e g , intense episodic dysphoria , irritability , or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days chronic feelings of emptiness , worthlessness inappropriate anger or difficulty controlling anger e g , frequent displays of temper , constant anger , recurrent physical fights , getting mad over something small transient , stress related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms i mean , okay , these symptoms cluster in some people , so why do n't i like them ? here goes , with no particular rhyme or reason the diagnosis unlike , say , trichotillomania or major depression is pejorative clinicians are sloppy with the diagnosis and it 's not uncommon for a doc to refer to a patient as a borderline as a defense the patient is difficult to deal with , he 's angry or demanding it 's gotta be him , not the doc it 's what clinicians label patients they do n't like actually , men are almost never called borderline they get to be narcissistic or antisocial treatment wise , many docs avoid these patients and hope runs dry quickly the prognostic implications are generally not great , these patient do n't have rapid and dramatic improvements the diagnosis ends up being it 's own endpoint , it does n't leave room for alternate explanations and sometimes patients with bipolar disorder look a lot like patients with borderline personality disorder oh , while i'm there , patients with borderline personality disorder often have co morbid bipolar disorder and hey , how about some substance abuse issues thrown in and if the clinician can get focused on treating the mood disorder , sometimes the other noise fades into the background it does n't seem to me that every patient who has these symptoms has them forever in an inflexible way they come , they go , they change , they get better , they get worse okay , so there are those people who tend to live life feeling victimized , who see things in black and white , who cut themselves to ease their pain , who ca n't maintain relationships , who create drama wherever they go i guess we 're left to call them borderlines
