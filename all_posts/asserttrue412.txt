sometimes you want to scrape some screen data and analyze it on the spot without copying it to another program it turns out there 's an easy way to do just that just highlight the information by click dragging the mouse to select a section of screen data , then run a piece of javascript against the selection example i do a lot of peeking and poking at dna sequences on the web often , i'm interested in knowing various summary statistics for the dna i'm looking at for example , i might see a long sequence that looks like agttagaaaacctcagctactag etc and wonder what the g c content of that stream is so i 'll select the text by click dragging across it then i 'll obtain the text in javascript by calling getselection tostring then i parse the text and display the results in an alert dialog suppose i 've selected a run of dna on screen and i want to know the base content the amounts of g , c , t , and a text getselection tostring get the data as a string text text touppercase optionally convert it to upper case bases new object create a place to store the base counts bases g bases c bases t bases a initialize now loop over the string contents for var i i text length i bases text i bump the count for that base format the data for viewing msg g bases g text length n msg c bases c text length n msg a bases a text length n msg t bases t text length n msg gc content bases g bases c text length view it alert msg if i run this script against a web page where i 've highlighted some dna text , i get the nice part is , you can put the above code in a bookmarklet , associate the bookmarklet with a button , and keep it in your bookmark bar so that whenever you want to run the code , you can just point and click to do the packaging , reformat the above code or your modified version of it as a single line of code preceded by javascript do n't forget the colon , then set that code as the url of a bookmark instead of going to a regular url , the browser will see javascript as the url scheme and execute the code directly bookmarklets of this sort have proven to be a major productivity boon for me in various situations as i cruise the web when i see data i want to analyze , i do n't have to copy and paste it to excel or whatever with a bookmarklet , i can analyze it instantly , sur la vitre
