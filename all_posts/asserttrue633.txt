silicon alley insider ran this graph of browser usage yesterday showing chrome continuing to make inroads on internet explorer and firefox the headline was google chrome is eating microsoft 's lunch i'm not sure the graph actually shows that what the graph actually shows is internet explorer 's market share has been downtrending quite convincingly since late firefox has apparently plateaued and in fact may be seeing some share deterioration in the last month or so , although there 's not really enough data to call it a trend yet opera has seen its traditionally miniscule share go down , if anything , over time safari has broken out and is now a visible presence in the market which you really could not have said , prior to july chrome has broken out and is a convincing third place player chrome 's break out really became apparent around august firefox 's upward trajectory , on the other hand , stopped around three months later , in november since then , firefox has been treading water , and in the most recent month its adoption slope has actually gone negative , although this could be a onetime anomaly it 's too soon to tell these numbers purport to represent global web browser market share just for fun , i 'll present a different data set traffic from this blog , broken out by browser the first pie chart shows browser usage by visitors to this blog , for the period january to march , the second chart shows browser usage for visitors to this blog in the period january to march , browser usage on this site , jan to mar browser usage on this site , jan to mar what we can see is that , first of all , people who visit this blog are a very firefox centric group and always have been that 's not so unusual for techie blogs but secondly , we can see that chrome usage is up sharply over the past year which agrees with the global data presented above while firefox usage is down sharply chrome usage more than tripled , going from in to just over in , while firefox usage sank from to internet explorer usage went from in to in the same period in these numbers are based on total traffic of , visits in the period of jan to mar versus , total visits for the same period in you can draw your own conclusions i conclude that chrome is coming on strong and it is taking share away from firefox every bit as much as from ie at least among the type of users who visit blogs like this one
