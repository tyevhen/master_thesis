it has been a while since i last posted mainly i have been doing quite well i am quite stressed as i have too much work to do i am getting a lot of support though and my boss has taken some tasks away from me and given them to others i have been to a number of social anxiety meets and even arranged one of them myself o this has led to me being invited to a bbq on sunday i think i will go o i had a really bad day last week , i was stressed from work and cried all the way home my thoughts started to work overtime i was starting to get silly negative thoughts that were not doing me any good i tried to go and see my friend but she did not answer the door that started my mind going on more silly thoughts as i had not slept well for a few days i went to the gp for an emergency appointment and asked for a sleeping tablet he would not give me one so i kind of got a bit angry with him and said i hate gp 's i told him how i wanted proper help in the form of therapy for years and the gp 's kept fogging me off with tablets until everything got so bad i stopped taking them and ended up in hospital now i want a tablet he would not give me one i sat in the surgery for about minutes crying and in the end he said he would give me a valium he told me i had to sort out my job and keep routine going i took this really badly as i try so hard to stay on top of things i told him i wanted something non addictive and he said it was valium or nothing ! ! i stormed out and did a great wheel spin out of the car park o i went home , took my emergency valium i have had in the cupboard for over a year , my seroqol and sertraline and then washed it all down with a healthy dose of whiskey i rang my friend and she came around that night and took me to the pub for dinner i slept very well that night and the next day i felt a lot better work is still really stressful and today was worse ! ! i have spoken to my boss though and he is helping i am sticking to hour days and if i do not sleep well or start having difficulty turning off in the evenings i am going to call in sick the next day my friends are comming to dinner tonight so i best start cooking ! ! o
