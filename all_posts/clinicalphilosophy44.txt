i 've said before that a hallucination is a 'negative' of a sensory expectation i kinda expect you to walk through the door you do n't and so your 'ghost' walks through but what is striking about hallucination is that the expectations are n't cancelled by reality itself if they were then , after all , we would n't hallucinate ! this experience , i 've claimed , is like always lurching on stepping onto static escalators but much of life is n't like that much of the time we manage to get disappointed we achieve relief this happens instantly and so we do n't 'see ghosts' so we need to understand more about why , sometimes , we do n't assimilate to the situation of the thwarted expectation i suggest it can be due to a failure of mourning sometimes it is n't bearable to assimilate the absence of the beloved so we hallucinate her but sometimes it 's due to let 's call it gormlessness we 're not really adequately looped in to reality we 're drifting trancily , hypnopompically , into doolally land , into the land of wish and fear fulfilment this is not a structurally different phenomenon than a failure of mourning we do this when we 're tired and we do it when we 're overwhelmed vital contact with reality in which sensorimotor expectations are updated through an engaged participation with a reality which we have afforded the opportunity to update us thus is an essential precondition for non hallucinatory acclimatisation someone who seduces themselves , or is thrown , into the twilight zone of omnipotent wishful and fearful phantasy , does not get auto updated so when reality does not conform to their expectation they 'see' or 'hear' the antithesis of their expectation this is a very different kind of explanation than the one the psychologists like to give of 'you hear what you expect to hear' their explanation ignores the role of a recalcitrant reality or at least this is an explanation of why we might 'see' what we expect to see it does n't wander off into pseudo scientific talk of 'interpreting visual stimuli' etc etc that is , it remains properly ontological
