i hate this phrase , it 's just utter bullshit you 'd hear this from your friend after that guy you liked dumped you , you might even say it back to that friend when the guy she likes dumps her some girls probably find great comfort in this little phrase , but no , not me i hate it i heard this a lot during my two years on and off with mr rebellious every time he stood me up , or was asleep when we were meant to be going out or dropped off the face of the earth for a few days without a word of warning my mum , my friends and anyone else i moaned to about him would conclude our entire conversation with you could do so much better when i was with mr rebellious i kinda thought this was true i knew he was a bit different to all the nice guys my friends were going out with , my mum told me this with her disappointed tone pretty much every day i knew i was nice to him , i treated him with respect and i would foolishly never stand him up back probably because i did n't want to face facts that he would n't actually be that bothered when i ended things i thought i would go on to bigger , better things , that i would meet a nice guy who treated me lovely i have been single for over two years you could do so much better suggests you were out of your ex beau 's league , that he will one day wake up with the realisation that he was a massive tool and will kick himself for letting you go , meanwhile your living it up with the absolute man of your dreams and a great big smile on your face i know it 's supposed to be a positive thing to make you feel better about yourself but i simply think it sets the poor dumped person up for disappointment also what about the idea that some people simply cannot do much better than their ex , what if they deserved everything they got from their ex i am sure they would also be told that exact same bullshit phrase i get told all the time i am too fussy with guys , that i need to lower my standards which kinda suggests they think i am a little above my station when it comes to guys , but i digress i know this is not true i know what i am looking for , i know i just want that spark connection with someone it does n't matter who they are or what they do if there 's a spark , there 's a spark and i will go explore it 's not about doing much better than the previous or than anyone for that matter it 's just about finding the right guy i guess that 's what gets me in pickles with guys others deem not worthy of me in the first place now when i hear this much dreaded phrase i simply ask right back well where is this mr perfect ? next time you get told this just have a little think , you can hit them in the face with my back comment if you like , buy that 's only if your as cynical and bitter as me
