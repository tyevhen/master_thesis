soon april st to be precise shrink rap will celebrate it 's th year as a blog no plans yet , but they are sure to include food seven years later , and i want to say that shrink rap life remains distinctly different from my real life as a clinician before shrink rap , the concept of anti psychiatry was a foreign one to me the idea that there were people out there who saw psychiatry as bad , that psychiatric medications cause more harm than good and should be made illegal for all , that psychiatry was about power , that the patient and doctor were anything but on the same side , that diagnosis a word was inherently stigmatizing or life destroying , this all was news to me maybe i was in my own little bubble what i 've learned on shrink rap has been illuminating at first , i thought it made me a better psychiatrist , more sensitive to a new realm of issues then i wondered if it was making me a worse psychiatrist here i was warning people of side effects that our readers had which i 'd never seen in years of practice , assuming people were wary of psychiatric medications when they they were n't and their only experiences of them were good made my brother so much better , and assuming people had qualms about treatment that they did n't actually have there are are literally days when readers are writing in about how medicines destroy lives and patients are sitting in my office saying , please do n't ever let me stop this medicine again , i never want to go back to that place in clinical practice , people come to me in distress and i work with them to help them get better if i have any sense that my goals for them are different than their goals for themselves , i verbalize my concerns and ask them to make sure that it 's their goals that we strive for in general , i'm the one striving higher it 's not all wonderful , some people do n't get better and psychotherapy requires chemistry i 've no doubt that i'm not the best psychiatrist for everyone , but i think most patients who do n't like what i have to offer just quietly go elsewhere and that 's fine , too my real life world is n't about coercion or trying to get people to do things they do n't want to do i listen , i try , i do my best , and i have my off days , too , because psychiatrists are human clinically , people come to get better and for the most part they do there are n't power struggles and there is n't a whole lot of clashing who would sign on for a career where everyday is full of emotionally charged confrontation ? no one has ever expressed anger with a diagnosis to me , it 's mostly a number that gets put on an insurance form so the patient can get reimbursed , not a stamp on anyone 's forehead , and diagnosis has little , in my experience , to do with prognosis most people come requesting medications , so we do that some do n't and if i think they might be helpful , i encourage them to at least try , but i 've never said , i wo n't work with you unless you 'll take medications much less a specific medication that is causing problems and i certainly ca n't imagine telling someone they had to stay on medications with intolerable side effects the good bad balance is the patient 's decision people come in eager to see me , either because they want the relief of talking when they are in a bad place , or because they want to share their accomplishments when they are in a good place sometimes people tell me they did n't want to come in , especially if they 'd been doing well and had stopped treatment for a while , and i understand that as well everyone is different , and that needs to be respected to read the shrink rap comments , you 'd think the therapeutic relationship was an adversarial war , and it 's just not seven years later , i continue to read the comments and be perplexed they do n't reflect my personal experience of clinical psychiatry
