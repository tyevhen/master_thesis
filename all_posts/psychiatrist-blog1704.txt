i 've been noticing lately that we get a lot of traffic from china i guess that makes sense it is only the most populous country on the planet but , it is now clear that the internet has hit china in a big way and opened its borders above is a list of our podcast traffic for the first week in june china is our international source of hits most of these hits are image files our logo but there are quite a few podcast hits though most are not completely downloaded most of the traffic comes from baidu , which is china 's version of google baidu is , in fact , a competitor to google , and is now china 's number one son , accounting for of all searchs in china while our podcast gets hits per week from china , our blog gets no traffic from china zero not one single hit this suggests to me that china censors all blogspot sites or at least all the ones which might use the word psychiatry or mental , but they have no mechanism for blocking our audio content of course , psychiatry has had a difficult past in china it has been used as a government tool for social and political control i'm sure there are some in the anti psychiatry movement who feel this way about american psychiatry this article points out that raw capitalism may now be the dominant force in chinese psychiatry now
