i blogged a while ago about continuations , which may play a role in making ajax scale well today i learned that continuations have been implemented on an experimental basis in mono 's virtual machine i'm not a python person so i did n't realize until after googling around a bit that the so called microthreads of stackless python are a way of achieving the same thing the key intuition behind stacklessness is that you move everything that would normally be kept on the stack out to a data structure on the heap therefore one thread can jump between potentially tens of thousands of execution frames the ability to run huge numbers of processes concurrently is obviously important in many kinds of applications if ajax becomes another driver of this technology , it 'll be interesting to see who 'll be first to implement a stackless java virtual machine
