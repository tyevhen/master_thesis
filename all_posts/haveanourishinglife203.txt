photo published on web here o lord , i do not know what to ask you you alone know my real needs , and you love me more than i even know how to love enable me to discern my true needs which are hidden from me i ask for neither a cross nor a consolation but simply wait in patience for you my heart is open to you for your great mercy s sake , come to me and help me put your mark on me and heal me , cast me down and raise me up i silently adore your holy will and your inscrutable ways i offer myself in sacrifice to you and put all my trust in you i desire only to do your will teach me how to pray amen
