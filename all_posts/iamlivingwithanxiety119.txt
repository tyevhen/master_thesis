thanks for visiting my blog here i decided to share some thoughts on living with anxiety it is not easy ! i have been an anxious person most of my life , including childhood i have struggled with obsessive compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety these problems run in my family i'm not sure what i want to accomplish with this blog maybe it will be just cathartic for me maybe somebody else will relate to my struggles , and we 'll start a dialogue we 'll see where it goes just writing this blog makes me feel anxious , but learning to tolerate and live through these feelings is part of the process of freeing oneself from fear i'm emphasizing living in this blog 's title i am not letting anxiety shut me down no matter how difficult life is , i'm not going to let it win being hopeful is an important part of the healing process
