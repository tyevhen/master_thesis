scientists recently discovered that disrupting a specific set of neurons in the habenula prevents normal response to stressful situations the habenular nuclei have been shown to be involved in many functions , including pain processing , reproductive behavior , nutrition , sleep wake cycles , stress responses , and learning scientists trained larval zebrafish to swim away from a light in order to avoid a mild electric shock fish with a specific set of neurons in the habenula that are damaged displayed signs of helplessness , and showed indications that they were more anxious than normal fish , being startled easily by non harmful stimuli the zebrafish brain is similar to the mammalian brain , suggesting that malfunction of the habenula is a possible cause of certain anxiety disorders in humans it may be possible to use direct stimulation of the habenula as a way of treating some types of anxiety disorders in humans so i guess looking at fish really does relieve stress source sify news , based on a study was published in the journal current biology full article here
