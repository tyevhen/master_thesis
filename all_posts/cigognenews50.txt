if you truly value privacy do not ever join the navy i will tell you why of us slept head to feet every night if anyone snored then none of us slept if you wanted to do a serious bathroom , do not go to the john there are little tin gutters with water flowing through them to wash it out we sat on the gutter facing guys just facing us with all the grunts and noises for me it was humiliating and worse , during battle and rough weather , the ship was rolling up and down and sideways and material was flying all over the place unbelievable when we tried to zip up and walk out , the waves were so high that we had to walk up a huge hill to get out , usually we bang against the steel doors or as the wave was deeper we found ourselves hurtling downhill to leave if we were eating then food fled everywhere during battle the inch guns moved the ship feet to the side and buckled decks their noise was deafening and many of us on the gun mount went partially deaf afterward if a bullet stuck we dared not touch it as it was white hot i had a machine gun mount just on the side of the inters and i never once considered that i was shooting at human beings , the mothers and children who ran into the sea to escape our shells these were not japanese soldiers , they were families who lived there it was their home , until we arrived i was never mad at anyone , i was just doing a job to kill and when a submarine tried to sink us we fired on the men who run up to the top deck to escape we blew them up to the top with our depth charges we had to take our guns and helmets with us during battle because we could not go back inside for days the ship had to remain waterproof at all times we used our helmet to do our defecation and washed it out by dipping it in the sea but we had no food and ability for ablutions for days at a time if you value privacy would you like to do that ? i never thought it was so bad , at age that is why they get us very young we know nothing and do not have the experience to question anything ayayay art
