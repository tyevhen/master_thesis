there is an article in the n y , times nov , for catholics , interest in exorcism is revived about a serious trend in the catholic church which is not so catholic , after all , and not quite sane , to boot american bishops are meeting to discuss how to prepare more priests to implement exorcism because the demand is so high what the clergy say is that they need help to distinguish between those who claim to be possessed who may need psychotherapy , and those who claim to be possessed who are normal or legitimate , and would need the church s help the clergy believes that not everyone who wants an exorcism really needs one it is only use in those cases where they devil is involved i presume they mean where someone is possessed by the devil now in case you think this is crazy , just remember that something like of the population believes in the devil so let me get this straight those who are possessed by heaven and hell will decide on those who are possessed by the devil none of all of those has anyone ever seen , felt or touched it is all socially sanctioned delusions all of it , by definition but let us not be too quick to condemn it i think they know that something dark and painful is in there but they just don t know what it is so they extirpate it symbolically where believers scream and yell , writhe and roll and do everything but put it all in context , which would really get rid of it real bad things did happen but it is not the devil it is pain , and it is indeed in there and needs to get out we must not be too quick to condemn this since it is little more than what the electroshock therapists and the psychosurgery doctors do too they slam , bang it , cut it out , do everything but solve what it is if all of them , clergy and doctors knew what lay down there , there would be no surgery , shock or exorcism all of them imply a mysterious , dark force , that like the id of freud is unknowable , immutable and life enduring and , immodestly , if they all knew that there was a way to get down deep in the brain safely without shock and or surgery they might do it now how on earth can a clergyman decide on one who is possessed be sane and one who is possessed be not sane ? possessed means insane , in my book it is , as i have stated , a delusion , something that exists only in the person s mind but of course , if you believe that he she it they exist you have no choice to agree with possession and while we are at it i assume that those clergymen who abuse children would be possessed by what or whom ? by their childhood and their parents they seem to be helpless before their criminal acts of destroying children their way out let s blame it on the devil when you deal with angels and demons you are not , by definition , in reality , except the one you manufacture it is called consensual validation i believe because you believe , and since we all believe it must be true wonderful ! the priests claim that they can heal , not because they have the power the power comes from jesus so now you have to believe in another abstraction well you say , the notion of the devil has existed for thousands of years so there must be some truth there somewhere yes , the truth lies in the very early imprints that exist in the unconscious , which drive us unceasingly , and which , perforce we must give it a name the devil yes , there is evil , done by humans , and if we do not know how pain drives us to be cruel , how unfeeling humans can be so bad with others , we remain at a loss to understand i understand that the church is training to do exorcisms because there are many shrinks doing training in primal therapy who have no idea what it is , what the science behind it is where all you have to do is scream , beat the walls and wail so shrinks , in the name of science and psychology , are doing no more than exorcisms i have seen films of exorcisms , and i have seen films of the holy rollers who roll on the floor and scream and yell , and then feel better afterwards i call that abreaction it is primal without the feeling and the connection but it is close i have seen patients who talk in tongues who babble on and on nonsensically but they get relief the church says that those who can do that are no doubt possessed in my groups i have patients get on their knees close , face to face , and babble but i want them to through all that to express their real feelings without any words within minutes the tears and sobs flow it is a very good technique when that fails i get the atheist to get on their knees and pray to god for what they really want again , tears and sobs and , real needs and real pain they say that the ordinary work of the devil is giving in to temptation it is not the devil , it is pure unresolved need and pain when my patients feel all of that they are no longer driven to cede to temptation all of this , the church claims , is bringing back the old church values and sanity , i presume pardon me if i disagree
