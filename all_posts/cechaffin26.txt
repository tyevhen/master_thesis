i just returned from a day stay at the ucsf mental ward , where they tried maximum medications and finally bilateral ect treatments to treat my acute depression with little success as they had done all they could do , i opted to come home , where i have a little more freedom and familiarity with my surroundings , and above all , a loving wife in kathleen whom i desperately missed in the hospital i wish i could report that i'm well but i'm not i'm still very sick and suffer from predictable weeping spells , suicidal ideation , anhedonia , sleep disturbance in a word , all the symptoms of a severe depression naturally this comes on the heels of a mania , recorded in these pages , which i did not correctly perceive for what it was as i was so happy just to be delivered from depression for a time but i'm paying for it now i ask for your prayers and encouragement there are times when i am so overcome by hopelessness i really do n't know what to do i become paralyzed , the proverbial deer in the headlight the smallest tasks overwhelm me i ask forgiveness for any i may have offended in my manic phase i said and wrote some cruel things when i was so sure that my judgment was divine and not just the product of a diseased mind , which it turned out to be , for the most part naturally i am embarrassed and ashamed but i did not choose this illness , it chose me it is not my fault but it is my responsibility , and a terrible responsibility that is someday i would like to feel like a useful member of the human race again but that day is not near now i am barely functional , just doing my best not to give into suicidal fantasies pray for me i hang by a thread , truly namaste in any case , craig erick
