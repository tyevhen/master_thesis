freedom is the greatest fruit of self sufficiency epicurus epicurus , a philosopher in ancient greece , believed that in order to live a fulfilling and happy life we should seek tranquility , avoid pain and overindulgence , be self sufficient and enjoy the companionship of good friends not a bad group of tenets to live by really epicurus also believed that the physical world was composed of atoms that continuously collided with each other randomly quite insightful , considering this was over a thousand years before the theory of particle physics had been developed i think he really had some great ideas and i try to implement them into my daily life as much as possible it is a huge clich , but the best things in life really are free sometimes i cannot believe that we are composed of so much space and that the spaces between the atoms are greater than the solid bits things have been really on an upswing around here recently i have completed the first of two paintings of jade , which i will attach tomorrow when i have a decent picture of the work i have been in contact with some great collectors and supporters of my work , some fantastic folks who i am very fortunate to have met all of these interactions feed the soul and provide a great sense of community there are some great projects coming up that are just under the surface i will share them as they develop my friend , who is also in a creative field , and i were talking the other day about how fundamentally our vocations and what we produce are superfluous no one really needs artwork it is a scary thought that when anarchy hits , be it in the form of a pathogen , economic collapse or any other number of scenarios , we 'll be the first to go oh well , at least i can draw pictures of people on the sidewalks , running by in the midst of chaos to chronicle the madness however , until that time comes , if ever , we shall endeavor to continue producing work that is special to us , in whatever form that may be i was speaking with my friend john today and we were talking about andrew wyeth , that modern day master of art this man is a genius there are two books by my easel constantly one is a book of paintings by lucian freud the other is a book by andrew wyeth his watercolours and tempera paintings are something almost otherworldly i have attached a link to his official site at the top please have a look you wo n't regret it i love wyeth 's treatment of light and shadow amazing compositions and a fantastic melancholy and sense of absence in his paintings that i really identify with today 's pet peeve modern day strollers they are behemoths ! when i was a child i had a tiny , collapsible stroller if you folded it up you could swing it and hit a golf ball it was compact , small and practical today these strollers are so large that in a pinch you could toss a tarp over one and camp safely underneath i'm surprised you do n't see a line up of the things down at the dmv getting license plates listening to all i need by radiohead watching starting out in the evening fantastic film with a stellar performance by frank langhella rent it if you love literature , fine writing and effortless acting , you should see this film i dream a lot i do more painting when i'm not painting it 's in the subconscious andrew wyeth
