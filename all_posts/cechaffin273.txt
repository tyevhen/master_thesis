there is a lithograph hanging in my bedroom entitled nine lives it is a pyramid of stylized cats in shades of blue , with the cat at the top of the pile nearly white , presumably representing the ninth life i have cheated death eight times , including twice in one summer while working on offshore oil rigs last night i used up my ninth , and i fear my guardian angel is back on prozac later , after my brush with death , we had a discussion about whether you got a tenth life after using up nine or whether nine was the limit derek stepson and i thought it meant you got a tenth while kathleen said nine was the limit she is more the glass is half empty half of our marriage , or in other words , the outrigger of sanity who anticipates danger should i list my other eight brushes with death ? no , in keeping with today 's infotainment cycle i 'll relate only last night 's occurence i was cooking a tough steak and sampled it before serving i got an especially grisly piece , or should i say fascia laden fascia is the tough , translucent white covering over muscles think of it as a cellular girdle without fascia our muscles would relax and we would be weak and uncoordinated , finding it difficult even to walk just imagine all the rubber bands holding the joints and skeleton together gone limp gristle ought to officially refer only to cartilage , that darkly translucent yet incredibly rubbery tough stuff that lines joints lacking a good common word for fascia , i 'll substitute gristle forgive this bird walk of medical semantics in sampling the steak i swallowed a gristly piece of elongated meat i swear it was sliding toward the right pipe when my epiglottis failed me and it slimed like a slug in a u turn down my trachea my first thought was , is my trachea truly occluded ? that was confirmed by my inability to speak yet because of the shape of the piece of meat , if i am not mistaken , i was still able to take in a little air around it maybe i could breathe , maybe i could n't the point is my trachea was plugged i reached for the back of my throat but could not reach the meat at this point kathleen and derek noticed i was in trouble kathleen bravely attempted the heimlich maneuver , but as i am ' and lbs , she could n't get her arms around me i was trying to give derek instructions in how to do it with hand gestures , but he had n't been trained yet he could reach around me while kathleen coached him so i wrapped my hands over his in a combined fist and pushed hard under my sternum to force my diaphragm up and we made a little progress , as i reached back and briefly touched the edge of the meat before it dived back into its snake hole instinctively i bent over , tried to cough , and finally snagged the tip of the meat with my fingers and pulled the little alien out i breathed freely i was a little light headed but nowhere near passing out i remember kathleen saying , that was a long piece of meat ! people often ask what you were thinking when you came near death i was n't thinking i was instinctively seeking survival , prepared to ram my belly against the top of the spinet piano next i did n't panic i didnt think about anything except the meat in my throat and how to get it out afterwards kathleen and derek went to pieces , literally , tears and all , not just because of my escape but because they had been discussing the death of her first husband , derek 's father , earlier the first thing i said to derek , whose face had turned almost white with terror , was , c'm here boy , let me give you a hug i pulled him close in his right ear i said , thanks for helping save my life in his left ear i whispered damn you ! as for many years i have longed to die , to free myself from depression and pain , though i think it better to stay and try to help put on the apron of life ! back to the revelatory moment after i had dislodged the meat and observed its sinewy nature stretched on the linoleum , my only thought was what a tough piece of steak ! later i ate more but sliced it very thin it was n't the meat 's fault , after all get back on the horse , get back in the plane , go chomp on the steak again it tasted good , though it was a little tough kiloneutral , ce
