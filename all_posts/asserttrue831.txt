a harvard professor told timesonline that executing two google searches generates about grams of co by comparison , boiling a kettle of water generates about g , according to alex wissner gross , the harvard physicist who researches the environmental impact of computing this sounds a bit high at first , but a quick back of the napkin calculation puts some interesting perspective on it in the u s , electric power companies generate about grams of co per kilowatt hour of juice so that would make two google searches roughly equal to watt hours of power if the professor is right converting to seconds , watt hours is kw sec if a google search takes a tenth of a second , that means kilowatts are in use for a tenth of a second in desktop pc terms , that 's about the same amount of power that would be consumed in that time interval by a couple thousand dells does it take the equivalent of a couple thousand desktop computers to process a google search ? it 's conceivable to me , yes far less conceivable is that a harvard physics professor with a much greater supply of cocktail napkins is going to completely botch this kind of calculation
