one of my favorite guilty pleasures is to watch music videos on you tube or vevo with my kids we enjoy listening to our favorite classics and making fun of those insane outfits and hairstyles i guess i enjoy watching music videos because it was a huge part of my teen years with the launch of something revolutionary called mtv or music television now for those of you who were not around in those days , mtv was the main source for music videos vh did not exist until and it allowed me to experience hours of music nirvana my parents would complain about my sister and i hanging in front of the television , but we were mesmerized by this new form of entertainment when mtv played music videos ! okay , what does mtv and music videos have to do with this post ? well , the point i am trying to make has to do with the importance of using multimedia in our school counseling presentations to engage our audience not that i am advocating for using a music video in your power point or prezi presentations however , i am saying that multimedia can make the difference in keeping your audience 's attention just like it had me and my younger sister glued to the television for hours believe me , i am still a novice at presentations , but i want to share a simple tip that seems to work well in most presentations one of my strategies is to add multimedia clips , videos , or sounds that enhance my presentation and engage the audience let me spell it out for you at the beginning of my presentation , i will use a video that is lighthearted and fun to get the audience to laugh later in my presentation , i will incorporate clips that may be more serious or heavier in content this is the meat of the presentation at the end , i always finish with a thought provoking video and provide a slide where they can receive more information grasshopper , mastering a presentations takes practice ! ! so , keeping it interesting can prevent your audience from checking their phones , walking out early , or engaging in conversations although i am still new at this multimedia stuff , i wanted to share some videos and clips that i have used in various staff , student , or parent presentations following the clips , check out some tools you can use to perk up your presentations oh , if you want real masters at multimedia , check out these blogs the counseling geek jeff ream school counsellor talk susan spellman cann my video vault addiction ap classes bullied people who overcame adversity what to do if you are bullied ? bystander effect careers college the majors of the star war characters star wars careers cell phones clep conflict conflict styles how to stop cyberbullying ? digital footprint decision day overcoming a disability caution one graphic scene of the musician 's finger tips being cut off by a machine otherwise a great video of resilience and overcoming a disability ! drinking effective communication empathy what is fafsa ? failure high school tips for freshmen point of video ask questions if you do n't understand ! mental health stigma online safety peer helping is not this is a good video of showing students why they must practice their skills peer mediation process peer pressure reach higher relationships self harm sexting soft skills communication soft skills enthusiasm attitude soft skills professionalism stress suicide teen brain teens the law attendance teens the law dress code teens the law leaving home teens the law sexting transition good for transition to college or high school be an upstander viral trends more sources for multimedia movie clips find movie clips to use in your presentations and with your small groups tools animoto customize your videos audiopal record your voice to insert in any presentation cartoonize make a cartoon of yourself to post on presentations clipgenerator create professional looking video clips ez tracks download music for presentations go animate make animated videos magisto upload and edit videos my brain shark download and narrate your presentation photoshow add music to your photos to make a presentation powtoon screencast o matic songza search and listen to any band tube chop great tool for cutting out parts of a video that you do not want to use vcasmo create a video out of your slideshow voicethread add your voice to any presentation wavesaur great source for adding music to presentations wideo make free animated videos see lots more on cool tools for school !
