i think your spirit or soul is grieved when you have a chronic illness it 's as if that beautiful soul is saying i am withering away because i want to be in a happy healthy body i think you can help by acting as if it is happy using you smile muscles and saying cheese raises the endorphins in your brain your brain ca n't tell the difference between a phony smile and a real smile , say positive affirmations , change your negative thinking , keep a gratitude journal , fill your heart with love meditate , listen to beautiful music , , try tai chi , get rid of stinking thinking , and send positive notes to others
