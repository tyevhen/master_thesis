lilly s attempt to cover up data on the risks posed by olanzapine zyprexa treatment has been exposed by an article in the new york times lilly s own published data , which it told its sales representatives to play down in conversations with doctors , has shown that percent of patients taking zyprexa gain pounds or more after a year on the drug , and some patients have reported gaining pounds or more but lilly was concerned that zyprexa s sales would be hurt if the company was more forthright about the fact that the drug might cause unmanageable weight gain or diabetes , according to the documents , which cover the period to snip to reassure doctors , lilly also publicly said that when it followed up with patients who had taken zyprexa in a clinical trial for three years , it found that weight gain appeared to plateau after about nine months but the company did not discuss a far less reassuring finding in early , disclosed in the documents , that blood sugar levels in the patients increased steadily for three years in and , more warning signs emerged , the documents show in four surveys conducted by lilly s marketing department , the company found that percent of psychiatrists polled had seen at least one of their patients develop high blood sugar or diabetes while taking zyprexa , compared with about percent for risperdal or seroquel lilly never disclosed those findings lilly also instructed its sales reps to downplay the medication s risks lilly s written response to these documents ? in summary , there is no scientific evidence establishing that zyprexa causes diabetes it also said that the release of the documents was illegal nice defense deny it and then say that the documents are not valid because they were obtained illegally this ought to make for quite a legal spectacle another apt quote from the nyt in some ways , the zyprexa documents are reminiscent of those produced in litigation over vioxx , which merck stopped selling in after a clinical trial proved it caused heart problems they treat very different conditions , but zyprexa and vioxx are not entirely dissimilar both were thought to be safer than older and cheaper drugs , becoming bestsellers as a result , but turned out to have serious side effects you really should read the full article , since i have only covered some of the evidence here the only surprise is that the company documents were made public thank you james gottstein ! , as the evidence has been mounting for some time that olanzapine was a risky drug whose small at best efficacy advantages were offset by its nasty tendency to produce diabetes hat tip furious seasons
