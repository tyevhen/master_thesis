in the end , i was happy the k this morning was far from easy , but i felt so much better than last week , i was happy we started under cloudy skies with rain threatening it was humid but relatively cool i knew the course was a mile loop , not out and back , but that was all i knew it became clear within the first few miles that it might also be hilly it was i started faster than i thought i should but kept it up , as i felt okay with the pace i was running within myself i believe i was somewhere among the top five women at the first mile between miles one and two i passed a few young men and a woman one young man stayed with me almost stride for stride for the next miles he could n't have been more than , but he was not going to let me go it was okay after awhile , i was almost glad for the company the paved bike path meandered around the countryside it was hilly up and down , up and down light and strong , light and strong those were the words i repeated to myself at miles i had two women in my sights they were at least and yards ahead , but i liked my chances i was feeling okay light and strong , light and strong breathe in , in , out , out i was in a rhythm then we hit it maybe it began at mile or i'm not sure when it started , but i can tell you this , it was the longest hill i have ever seen in a race ever ! one and a half miles later and we were still running up and into the wind is n't that always the way up and into the wind ! it was a cruel hill , that 's for sure somewhere on the way up i passed the woman who had been yards ahead but that woman right in front of me , she never came back my sidekick and i survived the wind and the hill the last of a mile was gratefully flat in the end , he raced ahead i came in one second behind , the third woman overall at an average just a smidgen under minutes per mile , and good enough for first in my age group i'm happy it was a very , very difficult course , and i was able to maintain what felt like an even pace most importantly , i did n't hit the wall ! i 'd like to be faster , but i 'll take it it was a good day
