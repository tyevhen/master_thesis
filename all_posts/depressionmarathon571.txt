it 's been a good week i'm sitting here relaxing after a very tough mile run more on that later i feel like i'm back in the saddle this is the first week since october , , prior to knee surgery , that i 've participated in what used to be my normal routine it 's the first week since my hospitalization prior to christmas that i worked a full , normal work week , too so it 's been a good week i began the week by attending my early morning strength training class that class requires that i get up just after am , and i was n't sure i was going to be up to it but i did it and i did it again on friday my knee was a bit sore afterward , but i was able to participate fully it was nice to be doing some good strengthening again , especially since i know it helps my running work was particularly busy this week , so i worked three full days one day was hectic and a bit overwhelming i know i would n't have been able to handle that day even one week ago but i handled it this week that was encouraging working my normal schedule will certainly help financially as well as i noted earlier this week , i ran well on tuesday i followed that up with a nice relaxed run on thursday so i went into this morning 's long run feeling optimistic unfortunately , it was degrees with a fairly stiff north wind when i left my house at this morning after a mile warm up loop with puck , i joined my local track club for the remaining miles running with the group is great , and it was nice to be back among my fellow running friends , but i ran a bit too fast early at mile , running uphill and into that freezing wind , i ran out of gas but i persevered , and i'm happy to have finished it was a good week of running i'm feeling much more encouraged about finishing boston a nice week it 's nice to have a nice week it 's been a while
