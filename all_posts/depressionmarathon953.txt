i'm eating my oatmeal it 's dark outside i hate that seems it was just a couple weeks ago , and the sun was shining brightly at this time i'm off to work in just a few minutes , and i'm dreading it i hate that , too dread is not my favorite emotion it 's not that work is bad in fact , it 's been rather enjoyable lately i'm dreading it because i 've been off for four days , and i 've grown rather used to my time we 've had the most beautiful weather i can remember this summer i 've been reveling in the sunshine for four days hmmm abundant sunshine perhaps that 's why i 've been feeling better i 've run and run some more i 've spent outside time with my mom and step dad puck and i have visited the local lake and golf has become my new , lengthy outdoor excursion can you see why i'm not looking forward to spending my day in a basement office ? oh , how great it is that this is all i have to worry about today ! no dark mood no sadness no drama i guess i can manage a little dread when my dread is only the result of my good fortune in fact , i'm even fortunate to have a job to dread , and i know that it 's all relative , is n't it ? our worries it 's a good day when my biggest worry is about going to a job i enjoy which finances my life i hope your worries are similarly based
