hi everybody , i know , i know i have n't had a chance to post lately been busy busy busy but i feel way better now seems like after i switched from mg to mg there was n't much of a change at the beginning , but now i feel like there 's a big difference in the last two weeks , i had another meeting with my doc , had few more dates , went out with friends , build cats condo and playground for my cat and i'm working on my psychology work that i need to finish it three weeks i feel improvement in all aspects of life now , i almost forgot about the anxiety , and honestly i cant remember when was the last panic attack i had maybe i should just scroll back to the older posts lol i'm not depressed any more , and i enjoy life experience and whatever they throw on me the bottom line is that things are better , way better now and i can finally explore myself and the world around me from a positive perspective i found a good solution for the alcohol thing , when i go out to pubs i just choose the beer with the lowest alcohol concentrations , that way i can drink freely and it does n't effect me too much the only thing that bothers me is that sometimes its hard to fall a sleep but hey , that 's a small price to pay for what you get well i have another date this week , i'm really into this love thing lately oh , and i'm singing in the morning sometimes ok my friends , thanks for taking the time to read this , take care and i will post another post soon email this blogthis ! share to twitter share to facebook reactions
