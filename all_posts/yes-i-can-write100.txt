a big thanks to sara for sharing her experiences here ! enjoy , and think about sharing your own stories in the comments section i am broke but i can still unschool one of the most common misconceptions about homeschooling and unschooling is that you have to be wealthy to do so i actually do get this comment from both parents of children who attend public school as well as some curriculum using homeschoolers , many of whom are quite well off and do not seem to understand if we cannot afford an expensive field trip or microscope this idea , however , is a bit ironic to those of us who consider homeschooling something of an ancient practice , the way all humans learned until the development of compulsory schools which , in america , was only around years ago how on earth did our ancestors learn anything , i always want to respond , when they were too busy working the fields , caring for one another , doing chores , and , well , living every day ? funny how literacy rates were higher back then , too but i digress of all of the unschoolers i know , many of them are in the same boat i am in i was laid off in , followed by my husband s layoff last year together we went from an income of about , to one that was , until this month when he got a new job , under , this was very difficult and still is , as we pay off debts such as student loans and we have had to make a lot of cuts , but we are still quite happy and healthy and we still unschool you don t need any additional funds to unschool or homeschool , really if you want to use a curriculum , there are several free ones available unschooling is simply living with your child every day , allowing him or her to make his or her own decisions no additional materials or programs are required only your time and attention , if that unschoolers rely on experiences rather than overhead projectors and expensive curriculum sets and now , with the internet easily at your fingertips , there s really not much you cannot learn even so , many of us unschoolers don t believe that money is all that valuable gasp ! there , i said it sure , we need it for food and electricity and other essentials , but we don t usually buy a lot of the same things our neighbors do multiple cars or cellular phones , televisions , video games , cable , whatever we do a lot of secondhand shopping my daughter enjoys yard sailing very much ! and we buy what we need , usually nothing more our values tend to reflect this as well indeed , our definition of success is does not include how much money or how big of a house you have , but how happy and healthy you are , how meaningful your life is to you , and how kindly you treat one another and the earth itself i am lucky enough to work from home , and my husband works very early morning shifts so we can both usually be with our daughter but i know unschoolers who take children to work , swap childcare with other unschoolers , or even utilize a good childcare program for part of the day while they make their living your child is going to learn no matter where he or she is or what he or she is doing , so why worry ? there are so many options available to you if you just look outside the box a bit which is , of course , what unschooling is all about ! please do not get me wrong there is absolutely no reason for you to feel guilty if you absolutely cannot unschool due to finances and a need to work very long hours so please don t feel guilty ! but that might not have to be the end of the story for you , either if money and or childcare are the only things standing between your family and unschooling , see if you can come up with a solution try brainstorming with other unschooling or homeschooling friends or on this blog ! and with your family and maybe you ll be able to come up with a creative way of life that is unique to your own family s needs one that will allow you to live life the way you always wanted to a note from the blog owner just a reminder to please be respectful in the comments each person is the expert on their own life , so if someone says they really ca n't unschool , please respect that ! of course , if people are asking for suggestions in how to make unschooling work for them , that 's something entirely different sara schmidt is an unschooling mom , writer , artist , activist , and intermittent graduate student from missouri the former editor of youthnoise , she has written for the whole child blog , teaching tolerance , the institute for democratic education in america , bluworld , ecorazzi , and dozens of other blogs , printed materials , and nonprofit organizations you might also like guest post the future of unschooling by jeff landale guest post answering negative questions does n't need to be a priority guest post unschooling everything held hostage by small metal implements a guest post by kelly hogaboom linkwithin
