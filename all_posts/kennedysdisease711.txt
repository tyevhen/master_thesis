i have a warped mind this morning while doing my neck exercises , i wondered what it would be like for a giraffe to have weakened neck muscles like those of us living with kennedy s disease i know the thought isn t logical , but it was a diversion in , i wrote a post on dropping headsyndrome it is still a popular post today i discussed some exercises in that post that i performed for several years to maintain neck and shoulder strength today , my weakened shoulders and neck are a regular distraction i wrote about the changein february of at first it was quite painful and the weakness pronounced later that spring the pain went away and i regained some of the strength back twenty months later i have learned to live with the issue , but it is a difficult one to accept exercisesdo help my soft collar also helps but , i feel the fatigue in the neck every day and some activities like eating at a table are an exercise in frustration and futility fortunately , as with most symptoms of sbma , some days are better than others i continue to exercise these muscles every day with the belief the neck would be far worse if i didn t and , as with everything else that has declined , i compensate and find workarounds unfortunately , one of those workarounds was to rest my chin on my hand i wrote about that in pinky painulnar nerve entrapment now that i am aware of the problems it caused , i try to catch myself doing it oh well , kennedy s disease the good , the bad , and the ugly
