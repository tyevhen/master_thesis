i 've been getting lots of emails with subject lines like r u dead ? ? ? and post something motherf cker ! and wheeeerrrrrree aaaaaarrrrrrrre yyyooooooouuuuu ? ? ? i 've been posting updates on twitter , but twitter is stupid and soulless and many of you understandably do n't use it , so i thought it would be prudent to give you guys an update here as well okay , so remember when i almost died ? that happened again , but not as bad this time the last couple days have been like playing guess who with diseases , but i'm pretty sure my doctors finally figured out what 's wrong with me and it probably does n't have anything to do with my heart , which is good the heart weirdness is most likely a benign genetic anomaly that is unrelated to the fainting , fevers , low blood pressure , and abdominal pain anyway , i finally decided to make a fan page for this blog on facebook as a way to give updates like this without having to make a whole new post about it http www facebook com pages hyperbole and a half if you 're looking for medical details , that 's where they 'll be posted i'm doing it this way because i understand that some of you are squeamish and i did n't want to be like hey ! guess what 's wrong with my organs ? ! and then have you be all holy crap , why would you tell me that without any warning ? you 're welcome edited to add you can still view the facebook page without having to get your own facebook account yay ! also , there 's a tab that let 's you choose to see only comments from me or comments from everybody if you 're looking for information , it might be easiest to click the only hyperbole and a half tab in summary still not dead will post soon
