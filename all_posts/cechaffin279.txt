greetings , earthlings ! i went online to order a passenger side headlight assembly for our plymouth voyager super beater did you know that the passenger side headlight assembly costs twice as much as the driver s side assembly ? must be that more drivers are creaming their left headlight is all i can figure still , ? discount warehouse , yeah ! the prices for many car parts are outrageous why can t they have more chop shops online ? yesterday we mailed my eliot ms , a labor of four years , to the professor who will read it for mellen press keep your cyberfingers crossed for me it would mean a lot to me if someone published this book still i won t give up after a first rejection by any means as some of you know , except for this blog i have given up new writing for the nonce i will embark on no new ventures until all my old ones are wrapped up and marketed to the best of my ability the novel s in good shape and so are two books of stories the columns , which kathleen believes in , i think are too anachronistic to be reprinted , as many of them concern current events such as and elections so i m doing a lot of donkey work yesterday i scanned about thirty different song lyrics in various states of disrepair onto my computer so that i can compile all the songs i ve written and record them as well i have many more songs to go it is a slow process , scanning and correcting moldy old papers with some print on them it might actually be easier to type them anew , but i like the whole process of reclaiming these old papers i used to write songs more often than poems certainly they are easier to remember , set to melody and all i like things you can whistle kathleen was named employee of the quarter in the charitable organization for which she labors , which included a nice bonus and now , with the manager s absence , she has been raised to temporary manager soon she ll be fundraising in manhattan with yoko my baby brother is so obsessive that i hope he doesn t read this my baby brother is so obsessive that i hope he doesn t read this my baby brother is so obsessive that i hope he doesn t read this my baby brother is so obsessive that if he reads this he will think it s about him , after which he will look for clues as to my real meaning my real meaning is hidden in the hollows of the letters what i have written there , too small for reproduction , is the secret of and cure for all his obsessions my baby brother is so obsessive that i hope he doesn t read this or he will be disappointed , not enough to obsess about my baby brother is and at least lbs big baby brother ! in the picture above he is the one on the right i think i m going slowly deaf i don t know which ear is worse either that or kathleen has taken to speaking more softly as our vision and hearing goes we shall have to tap morse on each other s skulls to communicate as for sex , i suppose grabbing will still do in a pinch we got another cat , topaz i promise pictures soon kathleen didn t want jo jo to be lonely while we re gone now jo jo s not lonely , she s pissed and hissing at topaz , who is nonplussed by the larger cat we call her topaz because she has a beautiful rust colored diamond in the middle of her forehead kiloneutral with occasional glimpses into the abyss , but working hard and whistling past the graveyard , craig erick
