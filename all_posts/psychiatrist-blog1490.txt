posted by clink thank you ! commentary by dinah i think i may have reached a new low in blogging i am posting a blank post dinah called me when i was on my way home from work to ask me to put up a blank in treatment post so that people would have some place to comment on the show until she could get to the blog okay , so this episode , alex returns to see paul with a top of the line italian espresso maker gift gotten off ebay , well , i found myself dozing alex brings the gift , a dig at paul 's awful coffee from the week before , he walks in , moves a model ship , a family photo , sets it up , starts brewing paul clearly feels invaded and uncomfortable , they agree it will stay for the duration of alex 's treatment alex talks about his family his friendless geek son whom he finally realized is happy with himself , his successful wife , his virtuoso mother , his philandering father oh , and he left his wife michaela paul draws parallels between alex and his father , we see the anxiety this brings out in paul who is dealing with his own lovelorn marriage guess what ? alex met laura outside and they went out alex figures shrinks do n't like that , that there are ethical issues for the shrink huh ? so i do n't know what this episode was really about , it was pretty boring power , i guess , the two men struggle with every aspect of their relationship will paul accept the espresso maker , will alex date his patient , will alex accept paul 's interpretations of his family dynamics ? lacking is substance , is that what clinkshrink said ? ? actually i think the show is a pretty good springboard for discussion i do hear that some folks are tired of it we 'll try to mix it up roy ? roy ? what 's going on down there
