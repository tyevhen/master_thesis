this blog post is aimed at anyone considering a career in forensic psychiatry please read this interview in the ottawa citizen entitled 'tough forensic guy' john bradford opens up about his ptsd' i'm going to preface this post by saying that i know the man featured in this interview he is an extremely accomplished and internationally recognized authority on the evaluation and treatment of sex offenders to think that we could have lost him is a devastating idea to me he has always been respected within the forensic community , but i respect him even more after this interview in this article dr bradford talks about the recent stress a pretrial evaluation placed upon him when he had to work overtime , under a deadline , to evaluate a sexually sadistic murderer he was required to watch actual videos of the crimes , to witness the killings and to hear the pleas of the women he knew were doomed the experience brought back recollections of other serious crimes and cases he had been involved with in the past in the interview he discusses the effects this had upon him over time and the challenges he faced when he finally needed to get help dealing with it getting treatment was particularly difficult for him , both because of his prominence but also because forensic psychiatrists are just supposed to be able to handle this stuff in his own words it s complicated , he says in my case it was macho i m a top forensic psychiatrist and i saw it as a weakness i don t talk about the treatment much because it s difficult for me but getting to it early is important i understand completely what dr bradford is talking about here over the years , forensic psychiatrists end up hearing and seeing information about crimes that are pretty terrible we see digital photographs of crime scenes , autopsy photographs , surveillance videos of murders , suspect interrogations , phone call tapes , written letters and other pieces of evidence that relate detailed information about violent crimes a single case can require weeks and hundreds of hours of study with repeated exposure to horrible events even without developing ptsd this can change your view of the world a bit at times i joke that when i give directions now i do n't use street names anymore , i give directions in terms of crime scenes take a left and drive south a few blocks until you get to the church that was the scene of the ice pick murder , then take a right until you get to the samurai sword decapitation yeah , it makes life a little weird there are prohibitions about talking about active cases , for legal reasons , but there are also good clinical reasons why you do n't talk about your cases with friends and family once you get these images in your head they do n't go away , and it 's not fair to place them into the heads of other people i warn my program applicants about this too to a certain extent , medical training weeds out people who are n't able to handle this i think there 's a reason why my medical school put anatomy class as the first class on the training agenda after four months hanging over a formaldehyde soaked body , it took me a while before i could eat chicken again the muscle fibers and tendons just did n't look the same after anatomy class some people complete forensic training and never touch a forensic case again and never do forensic work i 've often wondered about that , and wondered what we could do ahead of time to help people decide if they 're really cut out for the work given dr bradford 's interview , we should probably also think about what we should be doing to look after the people who stay in the work
