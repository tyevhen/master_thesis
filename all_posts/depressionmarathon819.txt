today was the running of our local marathon , but i was out doing a marathon workout of my own just as the runners were getting started miles away , i was hopping on my bike for a mile ride i had hoped to ride it in minutes , but it was very hilly for the first miles , and we all know i suck on hills , so it took me to finish i followed the ride with a minute run my legs were very tired ! but it was a great workout in total , i covered almost miles in just under hours after showering , i hoofed it to the marathon finish line to cheer if you ever want to be inspired , check out the finish line of a marathon most of my friends had already finished , but i got to chat with a few of them seems most had a good day it 's been a long , slow , lazy day since i returned from the marathon i napped , paid my bills , and watched some college softball on tv after such busy ness over the past few weeks , it 's strange to have nothing to do that 's not entirely true , i guess there are several things i could do , but i'm choosing not to i'm being lazy instead i could go golfing , but it 's really hot i could watch some work inservice videos , but who wants to sit inside and work on a holiday weekend ? i could go help my parents move into their new rv , but they might drive me crazy ! instead , i'm resting , getting a little bored , and trying to figure out what to do next such problems i have these days , huh ?
