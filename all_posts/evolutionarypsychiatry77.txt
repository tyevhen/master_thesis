ahs is next week ! in new england all the short sleeved outdoor fun has to be squeezed into about weeks of decent weather , so i'm taking it one day at a time at this point but i did manage to put together my presentation which is on friday at over the weekend i swear when i looked at the schedule the first time i was directly opposite mat lalonde , but it turns out i'm just after mat but in another room , so i 'll stop grousing though maelen fontes' antinutrients looks really interesting too i do n't have a lot of time , so i 'll be looking at trans fats and carbohydrates and how they affect mental health it should be fun , and even if you follow my blog religiously you wo n't have seen all the stuff that will be covered but back to other interesting papers i 've come across recently the first one is from the archives in feb these researchers randomized people at ultra high risk for psychosis aged years to two groups the individuals had to have experienced a brief and mild psychotic symptoms already or have high genetic risk typically a first degree relative with a psychotic disorder and loss of social functioning young people with these sorts of symptoms have about a chance of developing a full blown psychotic disorder within the next months when followed in previous research identifying and treating these ultra high risk individuals is a hot topic in research today , since preventing schizophrenia , if possible , would obviously be a lot better than having someone suffer devastating psychotic episodes , hospitalizations , or having to drop out of college defining the group of individuals to study has led to some misperception about the diagnostic category psychosis risk syndrome which to many seems like psychiatrists are trying to pathologize eccentricity among youth the category was developed to have consistent criteria for these preventative style research projects , not to try to change every teen ager with black eyeliner and an interest in esp into a polo wearing business school student these caveats are not to say the research is n't controversial sometimes it involves putting ultra high risk kids on antipsychotics to see if it will prevent conversion to schizophrenia or other full blown psychotic disorder later on any time one treats generally healthy young people with drugs with lots of side effects , one had better be trepidatious however , the study i'm referring to took a much less aggressive approach the young people either took an omega fatty acid mg epa , mg dha , and some vitamin e as mixed tocopherols supplement for weeks or placebo g coconut oil and the same vitamin e adherence was calculated by measuring rbc red blood cell membrane fatty acid content and by self report no use of antipsychotics were permitted or if full blown psychotic symptoms were present for more than a week , standard treatment was started and the individuals left the study , and both treatment and placebo groups had some standard psychosocial counseling sessions helping cope with stress , learning life skills , etc after the week treatment period , the groups were followed closely for the next months among the placebo group , of developed full blown psychosis during the month study only of in the treatment group developed psychosis the difference was statistically significant and comparable to similar studies using the far more toxic atypical antipsychotics that 's an impressive result for a relatively simple intervention and it would be nice to see it repeated at different medical centers the next study was published earlier this year and measured rbc membrane fatty acid content in adolescents admitted to the hospital for treatment of depression vs controls long chain omega fatty acids play all sorts of important roles in the brain in membrane signalling , synapse formation , dendritic growth , and seem to help facilitiate communication and repair low omega levels in the red blood cell membranes correlate with sudden cardiac death and depression in adults , though supplement trials with omega have had mixed results there were two major problems with the study cases and controls were significantly different with respect to ethnic groups which might affect genetic differences in metabolism and conversion of dietary fatty acids to those incorporated into the membrane also , no attempt at dietary measures were taken , so it is unclear whether differences are from metabolism or dietary differences however , in the end , the lower the dha in the cell membrane , the more likely a subject was to be in the depressed hospitalized group more to look into !
