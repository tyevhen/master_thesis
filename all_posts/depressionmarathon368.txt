i am in an unusual space depression has tunneled me to depths previously unimaginable , to the point where i am having trouble identifiying any point to continuing i do n't usually write things like this i try to maintain a little more optimism , even in the face of pain , but this has been one hell of a brutal ride i'm getting tired , and i want to step off now i'm doing my best to hang on i'm talking to the professionals and to my friends i'm in pain , and i'm letting everyone know it but it sucks ! i'm not sure what else i can do at this point in time i 've had the will to run stripped from me i have n't run in weeks that in and of itself is quite strange i'm not working my doctor has taken me off work , but i'm hoping to get back there soon i miss my co workers and my patients it would be nice to get back to my old routine i'm home but feeling out of sorts and a little lost within my own home environment that 's the after effects of the ect treatments my own environment is unfamiliar previously , i had routines for everything making my breakfast oatmeal , for example , was a routine this morning i could n't remember what went in the bowl and what did n't likewise , my house bills are waiting to be addressed , but i ca n't remember how to address them ! for someone as organized as me , this is all quite disconcerting i feel like an idiot ! i am fortunate to have one friend , wendy , who has been willing to sit with me a lot over these past couple weeks she 's been willing to witness the suffering , yet keep me safe , without attempting to fix everything i appreciate her presence sometimes it 's nice to just have someone to witness the pain she does n't talk she does n't offer rememdies she just sits with me i am so grateful for her presence and now i am going to attempt to move through my pain i may even attempt a walk outside with my dog , jet we 'll see that sounds like quite an undertaking i 've called my mom she 's down south for the winter , but she may fly up to stay with me for a bit i could use her assistance and guidance , at least until i get some space between me and depression 's ugliness and this may be the ugliest episode i have ever experienced relief cannot come soon enough
