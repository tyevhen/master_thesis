while sitting at my desk the other day , a teacher brought down a student to my office unfortunately , i did not know the student she was not in my section of the alphabet , but she looked really upset so i welcomed her into my office once in my office , she flopped down into a chair and tears began to stream from her eyes my heart went out to this student and i said , i am not sure if you want to talk , but i am here for you if you decide to talk to me looking uncomfortable , she faced the floor and wiped her face with her hands the student looked disheveled her hair was messy and her clothes were stained and i noticed that her eyes were puffy it felt like an eternity before she said anything to me and when she did speak it was soft and low softly she said , i do n't think this is a good idea i am really okay okay , i thought , i just ca n't let this upset student leave my office what i am going to do ? ? ? i understand you not wanting to talk , but if you are not feeling better please know that i am here for you anytime at first she got up to go , but then sat back down and started crying again i do n't know what to do , she cried i just want to be like other kids and be able to stay in the classroom without getting into trouble ! she continued and said , you know i have add , odd , ptsd , and tourettes and i just want to be normal ! she looked at me between her tears and then buried her head in her hands trying to lighten the atmosphere which can be a big risk and sometimes backfire i said , wow , you are a walking alphabet i know and one of the teachers said that i should be back in self contained , but i don't want to go back ! ! ! i wo n't go into our conversation , but she left better than when she came in however , it was heartbreaking to hear her story about her mental health issues and her lack of mental health treatment besides this student , i have seen many students over the school year with an assortment of mental health issues just to summarize my year , here are just some of the symptoms i have seen in students senior with severe depression , anger issues , and suicidal ideations senior with auditory hallucinations the student had a name for the voice that she has had since middle school voice often tells her to do bad things senior experiencing severe anxiety which causes digestive issues and migraines leads to many absences senior with history of abuse , depression , and disappearing for weeks at a time junior experiencing severe anxiety to the point she was hiding in the bathroom sophomore displaying risky behaviors like skipping , outbursts , and leaving campus sophomore experiencing severe depression and anxiety causing her to miss school for weeks at a time freshman with suicidal ideations , depression , and low self esteem from bullying she had a withdrawn physical appearance freshman with suicidal ideations , severe trauma , and reactive attachment disorder freshman with suicidal ideations and self mutilation freshman in foster care with odd , violent tendency , and severe learning disorder all these students were referred to either our mobile crisis unit , an outside mental health professional , our school social worker , or school based mental health services we are fortunate to have a great system of care , but there are many school districts that do not have access to services so many of their students go without mental health services in fact , in an article by today duke , teens suffering from phobias or anxiety disorders were less likely to receive mental health treatment than students suffering from odd , adhd , or conduct disorders also , african american students were less likely to receive treatment than their caucasian peers mental health issues for teens need information about teen mental health ? the adolescent mental health in the united states website has great information regarding the state of mental health of teenagers in our country due to hormonal changes and brain development , teens are more susceptible to depression and at risk behaviors that impacts their emotional and mental well being many mental health disorders emerge during adolescence and of teens have a diagnosable mental health disorder interestingly , of youth who have an anxiety or impulse disorder develop these disorders during adolescence untreated mental health issues can have negative results for teens these results include dropping out of school , strained relationships , involvement with child welfare and djj , substance abuse , risky behavior , and even suicide in fact , suicide is the third leading cause of death in teens unfortunately , i see too many students with mental health issues who go without services when students lack needed services , they suffer in their academics , in relationships , and with self confidence in the last year , i have seen several students who suffer from past traumatic events and have suicidal thoughts thankfully , i was able to refer them to services , but i often think about those school counselors who do not have these local resources also , there is such a great misunderstanding and stigma about providing mental health services to students because of this lack of understanding , students often go without crucial services which continues into college often , parents think that students will grow out of their problems when they get into college and they will be okay however , it is our job as parents and professionals to help students transition into college whether they have a disability or not in order to do this job effectively , it is important as high school counselors to know what resources are available and to provide these resources to our families and students a great time to educate students with disabilities and mental health issues about transitioning into early adulthood is the month of may may th th is national children 's mental health week which focuses on the importance of caring for every child 's mental health from birth to young adulthood nami mental health toolkit this toolkit is from , but works for any year ! what can school counselors do ?
