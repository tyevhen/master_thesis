this is what i wrote in my diary , on the th march , three months into depression i feel inadequate i hate myself it feels like god hates me even though i know he loves me but i can t stand myself only three months earlier , my life had been full of purpose i was serving as an assistant pastor in a local church , involved in pastoral care , discipleship , the music team , and preaching i was also working towards serving as a missionary in asia i fully expected to be one of the best years of my life yet due to undiagnosed complex partial epilepsy , chronic insomnia , overworking through the whole year , suffering a massive shock , and worsening panic attacks , my life fell apart at the end of shock , bewilderment , confusion , denial , fear and anger raged through me as a multitude of depression s symptoms tore my life to pieces in the first week of i had become so despondent that i abandoned my life dream of becoming a pastor and a missionary and left the ministry i soon found myself unable to face people and lost contact with almost everyone i knew th may self hate keeps descending upon me like a swarm of angry hornets i look at myself and find nothing but contempt for this pathetic person i have become i prayed non stop to be whole again , but to no avail all day , every day , i suffered from disturbing mental , physical and emotional discomfort i was certain that my mind and body were plotting and raging spitefully against me and this drove me to distraction i felt completely useless and utterly worthless th july my reaction to this lack of peace is to hate myself , to think that i'm useless , and to wonder why my emotions continue to stuff me around like this ca n't my emotions tell that they have ruined me , and are ruining me ? it is easy to see how such suffering and negative changes in our life can destroy our self concept and lead to self hate , taking depression to deeper depths the purpose of this article is to encourage those experiencing self hate , by showing that although these feelings seem to be justified , they are in fact a lie , and have no place in our lives we cannot throw off such feelings overnight , but we can re train our underlying thought processes and conform them to god s word , bringing wholeness and relief we need to be patient with ourselves the first thing we need to do is to recognise that we are ill depression is an illness , just as is diabetes , or deafness in late i was admitted to hospital to receive major surgery on my left ear , which was deaf the bones of my middle ear were replaced by a titanium prosthesis i spent three days in hospital after the operation followed by two weeks at home for the next three months i was not permitted to partake in any strenuous exercise no one would look at me in that situation and criticise me for taking it easy nor did i hate myself for ceasing so many of life s normal activities for three months this is the attitude we need to take towards depression recognise it is an illness , be patient with ourselves and allow ample time for recovery , even if it takes months or years we must be careful to recognise our limitations and not have unrealistic goals or expectations this does not mean that we should hide from the world , only that we do not expect too much of ourselves do not look back one of the biggest pitfalls of depression is to look back wistfully at what we used to be like , and lament over how low we have fallen we would give anything to be like that again i spent hours and hours ruminating over the past and wishing i could go back there or be like that again this process is counter productive it only makes us worse the christian counselor i saw taught me this to be in deep surrender to god really means to never look back with regret upon the past , nor forward to any wish of what we want to be like in the future comparing ourselves to what we used to be , or what we want to be like , is a hindrance to resting in god 's will we must be content to be who he made us to be today , to be content to be where he put us today , and to be content to be how he made us to be today let us again consider philippians i know what it is to be in need , and i know what it is to have plenty i have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation , whether well fed or hungry , whether living in plenty or in want i can do everything through him who gives me strength how does god view us ? while suffering from depression we cannot trust our own opinion of ourselves a friend who had experienced depression told me , we can t see properly in times like this our feelings completely distort our world view and vision so let us look at how god views us , and then view ourselves through jesus eyes genesis says , then god said , let us make man in our image , in our likeness , and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air , over the livestock , over all the earth , and over all the creatures that move along the ground we are not the chance result of millions of years of evolution , but created in god s very image the bible says that although we are sinners , we still have great significance and value psalm says , what is man that you are mindful of him , the son of man that you care for him ? you made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honour even in our fallen , sinful condition , the bible shows us just how much god loves us but god demonstrates his own love for us in this while we were still sinners , christ died for us romans god did not wait for us to become perfect before he loved us he loved us so much that he sent jesus to die in our place so that our relationship with god can be restored hebrews says let us fix our eyes on jesus , the author and perfecter of our faith , who for the joy set before him endured the cross , scorning its shame , and sat down at the right hand of the throne of god what was that joy set before jesus that motivated him to die for us ? it tells us in thessalonians he died for us so that , whether we are awake on earth or asleep in heaven , we may live together with him jesus treasures us so greatly that he wants us to share our whole life with him john tells us that to all who received jesus , to those who believed in his name , he gave the right to become children of god children born not of natural descent , nor of human decision or a husband 's will , but born of god those who believe in christ are god s very own children ! psalm tells us that we are god s treasure keep me as the apple of your eye hide me in the shadow of your wings it always encourages me when i think of jesus looking at me as his treasure corinthians says , god made jesus , who had no sin to be sin for us , so that in jesus we might become the righteousness of god this means that when god looks at us , he does not see our old , sinful nature , or our problems he sees the purity and righteousness of jesus in us instead romans reinforces that therefore , there is now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus this is a very important lesson for us to learn do not let guilt and condemnation trip our feet jesus has forgiven us and cast our sins into the deepest sea ! god comes to live in our hearts if we ask him john says , jesus replied , if anyone loves me , he will obey my teaching my father will love him , and we will come to him and make our home with him we are god s temple what an honour ! zephaniah is one of my favourite verses in the bible , because it shows exactly how god thinks of his children the lord your god is with you , he is mighty to save he will take great delight in you , he will quiet you with his love , he will rejoice over you with singing download a pdf booklet of this blog 's articles
