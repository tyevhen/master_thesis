hanging out chewing his kong , jet 's recovering nicely from his surgery the surgery was a complete success the surgeon found a huge chunk of bone floating around in jet 's right elbow joint the bone fragment was so large , the surgeon had to break it into smaller pieces in order to extract it from the joint this was all done arthroscopically , so the recovery quiet time will only last two weeks , rather than six , as i had originally been told that was a relief ! i was also relieved the surgeon actually discovered the chunk of bone it certainly did not show up on the x rays , so we were just supposing it was there based on his other symptoms jet was likely in a fair amount of pain , despite not always showing it he does have arthritis in the joint , which is a result of the bony fragment floating around in there hopefully , with supplements and a slow return to activity , it will remain mild for a long time to come the surgeon told me the recovery from this procedure varies widely he thought jet had a good chance for meaningful recovery , but he had no way of predicting if jet will ever tolerate normal levels of activity , like running with his mama we 've got some doggy physical therapy to do over the next weeks , and then we can begin short walks we ca n't even attempt running for at least another months of course , if he limps with walking , we wo n't ever attempt running i'm not worrying too much about running right now i'm relieved he 's home and well i'm grateful this procedure gives him at least a chance at a full recovery thank you for your kind words and prayers as jet and i have traveled through this process he 's doing well and come to think of it , so am i
