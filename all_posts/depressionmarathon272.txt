surgery , so far , has been a success of course it 's hard to tell exactly , as i'm still in the initial stages of recovery i had my right hip arthroscopic surgery on tuesday the surgeon did a cam and pincer resection , for those of you wanting the specifics , which is exactly what was planned basically , he resected bone from the hip socket and the head of the femur in order to stop the impingement pinching which was causing my pain fortunately , i am able to put as much weight as i tolerate on my right leg in fact , once i awoke from the procedure , i was able to walk out of the building it hurt , but it was nice to be able to put weight on my leg immediately since tuesday , things have improved i 've already been able to discontinue my pain meds , and my limping has gotten less and less pronounced i'm hoping to be able to walk jet by this weekend and to get on my stationary bike by early next week i'm hopeful this procedure , my third , will take care of my pain permanently it is going to be quite difficult to lay low and not run for three months of course , the weather has been absolutely perfect for running since tuesday god has a strange sense of humor in two weeks , after my incisions fully heal , i 'll be able to get in the pool i dislike getting into a cold pool , and swimming bores me , but i'm committed to maintaining as much of my fitness as possible my mental health depends on it in other news , my parents , who have been very helpful over the past couple days , have left to go south for the winter i wo n't see them again until may , my mood always takes a bit of a hit when they leave , and today is no exception i enjoy my parents we have been making up for lost time over the past few years , and we 've gotten closer and closer during that time i miss them when they are gone for so long , but i'm happy they have found a lifestyle which suits them and keeps them active and that 's today 's news i'm off to run some errands and lift some weights arms only at the gym the quest to stay fit starts today
