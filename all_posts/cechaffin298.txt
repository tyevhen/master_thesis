when i find myself weeping and the object of loss fades away until my depressive mindset substitutes another reason for tears , i try to slap myself inwardly i try to allow tears about rachel without bleeding into tears about my extremely negative self view so i am lost in the middle of a dark wood at what s more important is she whom i lost when you lose someone very close to you it ignites other fears the thought of losing kathleen is or one of my other daughters is unendurable , of course how could a man bear that ? how do mothers with multiple sons lost to war cope ? one of the saintliest men i ever knew was a cardiologist , dr srinatha he lost his entire family in india in one crash he was the only one not in the vehicle he was the most compassionate of men , patient to a fault , willing to explain anything , and he never complained about being called to the ccu at am his presence was always calming and his smile spiritually reassuring i do not think his demeanor was solely a product of nature i like to think grief helped transform him into the saintly being he became although grief can also bring lead to bitterness and isolation , the economy of the closed heart must eventually fail we need others too much i hope i m not leaning too hard on kathleen sarah tells me to be a poshead and not a neghead i m in total agreement save for the wiring in my brain as for living with the conscious threat of a loved one s death , it can t be done sanely we simply cannot operate while consciously cognizant of mortality , our own or theirs such knowledge is existentially crippling and must be practically delimited , yes suppressed , to accomplish the smallest endeavor every action depends on faith , whether we trust our legs to rise out of a chair or trust gravity while pouring water in a glass we must live in denial to live we cannot indulge in the descartian cartesian luxury of questioning every underlying assumption that leads only to an obsessive unbelief in our own existence derealization , as the shrinkolas call it one thing that mixes up my grief the writers conference i was told point blank by two agents that my writing couldn t earn money , that hardly any writers earned money writing for money had been my new goal of self redemption , a way to get off the disability wheel that throws protestant guilt at me like a gorilla heaving turds from a cage and now i hear from the experts that my dream is wrongheaded this is no time to listen to them or analyze my chances , but the timing didn t help i was sad enough not to need my face rubbed in it i don t want to give up hope but this is no time to globalize about my future and my future goals this is a time to take the long way home through the graveyard sarah leaves tomorrow god bless her ! i may get back to the work of writing when she s gone i didn t want to waste my time on it while she was here i m in a public library trying not to cry earlier during my lunch break between the two halves of my mushroom identification class i did cry but i cleaned up pretty good last thing i want is to have someone stop me and say , woman , why do you weep ? who wants to hear of your loss ? why spread the peanut butter misery of this world any thicker on the planet 's crust ? my essay in blue fifth will soon be re printed in the schuylkill review forgive the spelling always nice to be wanted my sister wrote kathleen that she worries about me sometimes if i don t blog i wish i had the energy to visit the blogs of all those generous enough to comment here i still don t get the princess di thing , ten years after her death today i think it was her innocence , or the innocence we projected upon her the same kind of innocence marilyn conveyed the same kind of innocence rachel looked back to we don t want the innocent to suffer we want to save them thine , ce
