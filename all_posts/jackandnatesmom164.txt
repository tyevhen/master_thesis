i know , posts in hours but my last few posts have been a little bummy , so i wanted to share a ridiculous experience i had tonight with my little guy i have been mentioning how frustrated i have been with nate 's lack of speech development , and i decided today to try to focus on other aspects of nathan 's development for awhile , kind of take the pressure off i put a few new pictures on his choice board app on the ipad and he chose them appropriately when he wanted them , so that was encouraging i decided to try something a little crazy right before bed tonight i have been told by multiple doctors , teachers , and other professionals that potty training is just not a priority for nate right now his comprehension is way behind , so it 's hard to know if he would even understand what we are asking of him , let alone to know if he has the physical control to actually do it but i decided to say screw it so i took him up to the bathroom , whipped out the training potty , stripped him down , shut the door and waited i remember this experience well from jack ya sit , ya wait for the pee to start , grab em , throw em on the toilet and cheer like a maniac got it i had the tub water trickling to speed things along and nate was loving putting his hands in the water i heard a couple little toots but thought nothing of it yeah , i kind of ruined the surprise just then huh ? in my defense , despite the fact that i am experienced in potty training whatever that means , getting jack to go in the potty was one of the most challenging things i have ever done he holds it forever due to sensory issues and has had some problems with constipation apparently nathan is opposite of jack in all areas yep , number , on the floor , like nothing was happening i grabbed nate as fast as i could and plopped him on the potty , mainly to minimize the mess unfortunately this actually made it much , much worse so i was frantically trying to clean up before nate stepped in something when i heard a couple of little drips i turned around and nate was peeing in the potty ! ! ! leave it to him to first create a major distraction so he could try it out in peace , lol i am just glad i caught it so i could cheer like a freak so all was not lost i have no idea if he got it , he did seem happy with himself , but only time will tell but i figure we can just try it this way for a while , no pressure however , mommy needs to pay more attention to other , ahem , warning signs from now on !
