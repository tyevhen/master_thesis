one of my passions , besides being a professional school counselor , is coaching students in their conflict conversations i know , i know who wants to get involved in drama ? well , i do n't like getting involved in drama , but i love helping students develop the skills to sit down and actually have a constructive conversation they may not become friends or even solve the problem , but they begin to learn the skills to have a constructive conversation to me , it is exciting to watch ! ! unfortunately , our culture does not hold constructive conversations as very important look at youth athletics better yet , let me show you what i mean one parent called it a dad moment and what about television ? you cannot turn on the television without watching a conflict ridden reality tv drama again , let me show you what i mean this is a special from abc news which shows how reality tv is making violence and watching violence socially acceptable what is unfortunate about reality tv shows is the influence that the producers have on creating drama to orchestrate high levels of conflict in today 's entertainment world , the need to be bad has proven to be very lucrative in our culture now let 's move on to schools this video below shows a fight set up by , wait for it , the bus driver ! the video shows two students fighting on the bus and get this quote from the bus driver what happens on the bus , stays on the bus with all these messages being sent to our families and students , it is not unusual that we have so much drama in our schools currently , violent responses to conflict have become the acceptable behavior being taught , modeled , and practiced in our culture daily i see bad behaviors practiced by our students and their parents one example that comes to mind was during the last week of school one of our students graduated early and her diploma was not ordered by mistake so , we placed a letter in her diploma case indicating that there had been a mistake and we were in the process of ordering her diploma well , that letter did not sit well with the parent the day after the ceremony , the parent called school and blasted the first person who happened to answer the phone that person did her best to apologize and explain that it was an unfortunate oversight , but the parent would not listen to her explanation immediately , the parent began to yell and curse on the phone in fact , the situation became so bad that the parent threatened to come to the school and beat a certain anatomical part of our staff member 's body good grief ! even though we do not live in a perfect society , as a school counselor , you have a great influence in changing the school culture i want to introduce a new role for you to try out the role of conflict coach what is a conflict coach ?
