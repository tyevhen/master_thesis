dear a b who knows what the alternative might have been if i did n't mess around with imaging and imagining ? i hear you that 's why i am a bit skeptical about this imaging stuff scripturially , we are told that god has more in mind for us than we could ever imagine for ourselves trying to beat life into giving us what we think we are owed indeed you 've pointed out other times that controlling behavior is fear driven faith is about seeing that life is a mystery unfolding , not a problem to be solved a leap of faith requires surrender to god , a higher power , the universe can i let go and trust that whatever happens is for the greater good ? you 've said before that much wisdom seems contradictory maybe imaging practice can be helpful , but as you seem to be suggesting , it 's not enough to build one 's life around the power of it may lie in the scriptural tenet , ask you shall receive , seek you shall find as you mentioned , i think we are meant to be creative and proactive and engaged and also to walk through life with an open hand , ready to receive and acknowledge the gifts in whatever happens we must it seems , find the right balance of surrender and action i guess that 's a key challenge for many people finding that balance i plan to order children a couple of your other children 's books on amazon soon i am intrigued by them ! could evil exist in the world because of our selfish natures ? you are praying for others , helping so many through your writing and research , and putting so much positive , unselfish energy out there your commitment to helping others often from your home reminds me of orders of nuns who live cloistered and never see many of the people they help , but they pray and dedicate their lives to lifting up humanity in peace if more people lived such other oriented lives , the world would be a different place if i make an image board in order to facilitate my husband 's career aspirations , the sale of my house , and the move to a good place , i am not sending energy out in the world for the betterment of the human race as i pull together those images and focus on them , i am also not making an image board for eradicating hunger , or ending war or stopping hatred and violence there is selfishness there , even if on the surface , such activity seems benign and harmless since i could be focusing the same energy on reducing suffering for others and fail to do so , am i not contributing to the presence of evil in the world ? i know this is a dramatic example , but you see my point multiply that sort of behavior i know i'm not alone by millions , and where does that leave us ? with people getting jobs and houses , and so on , but the world keeps spinning around in turmoil does bad stuff happen , in a way , because exponentially , our self centered energy lets it happen ? ? ? thanks again for the interesting discussion and feedback ginger dear ginger , well , do n't forget the having fun part of life if you have imaging talent , it 's all right to pursue it some people do n't have the knack it 's all right to image something for yourself it 's just not the end all and be all secret to life for everybody some people are mystics , some are saints , most of us are just ordinary sinners looking to find our way one wise man once said , some people only have the energy to save themselves but , it 's certainly better to imagine good things coming our way than fearing we 're going to get shafted again i have always been convinced that as long as i used the phrase for the good of humanity before i attempted to use imaging or prayer , that everyone was safe from my meddling , including me after all is n't it imaging that accounts for the wonderful inventions that make our world such a wonder man is a star , said paracelsus , even as he imagines himself to be , such he is i guess the main thing to remember with imaging is that your whole concentration should be on the imaging itself without any effort , or mental investment in how it all turns out , except for the disclaimer about the good of humanity and this might help richard cecil defines duty thusly duties are ours , events are god s this removes an infinite burden from the shoulders of a miserable , tempted , dying creature on this consideration only can he securely lay down his head and close his eyes in other words if you are a golfer , the idea is to put your whole effort into perfecting each stroke you are not to be thinking about the score at the same time all effort should be on the action , not how great you are as the actor , or how wonderful you hope will be the outcome i also like the lesson from anne morrow lindbergh in her book gift from the sea in a vacation by the ocean , we start to relax and are not so interested in dredging up the bottom of the sea for its treasures , just expecting whatever small pleasures a walk on the beach will bring , the morning breeze , a shell washed up on the beach , patiently , patiently , choiceless as a beach waiting for a gift from the sea every part of life has it 's lesson to teach us winning and losing , we ultimately only win ourselves is n't that good enough ?
