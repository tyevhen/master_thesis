i have a goal to be intentional about making this summer whether that be with yarn , fabric , wood , paint , or food , i have some aspirations first of all , i absolutely go a bit crazy when i have a project languishing for too long , that means i have a few things that i absolutely want to get done before we start back to school in august first of all , i have a pair of socks that i knitted for brad i finished the second sock while we were in tennessee in may , but forgot my dpn 's so i could n't finish the toe and it 's still sitting in the project bag now a month later ! what ? ! that 's definitely a priority not because brad needs wool socks in the summer , but because i only have several rounds left on that darn sock and it needs finished ! i also want to knock that large crocheted afghan out of the park over the next three months it 's already quite large , but my goal was to make it huge so that multiple bodies could snuggle under it i was working along at a very nice clip until i ran out of yarn and had to order more and then , subsequently , lost my momentum i'm using this pattern by attic another fun crochet project was the market bag i literally made that entire thing in under hours , start to finish i used this pattern , and i love how it turned out it 's a bit bigger than i thought , but that just means i can fit more things into it this was a practical item for me to make , and i do plan on using it when i visit the little farmer 's market we have here in the summer but i could also see this bag being very useful for the beach as well lily is currently making a crocheted rug out of thrifted sheets i made another thrift store run yesterday morning for more sheets one of our local thrift stores sells flat sheets for each , and you really ca n't pass that up , especially when you have a use for them i bought enough sheets for her to make her rug , as well as enough for me to make one i also have a collection of vintage , thrifted pillowcases that i want to trim with a crochet trim this will probably not be done this summer , but it 's definitely on my list of creative to do 's i love the look of these pillowcases in addition , i bought that charm pack last spring because i wanted to make a quilt not an over the top quilt , but , rather , just a plain , simple patchwork quilt i 've only ever quilted a few smaller projects , so i think intimidation has been preventing me from actually cutting into that fabric that 's silly though , is n't it ? handiwork has become a very important pastime here in our home i suppose it has something to do with me sticking the kids in their highchairs at the age of one with oversized paint brushes and non toxic paint they 've always just seen the process of creating from both brad and myself , so i suppose that they would just naturally assume the same habit in the above photos , the sewn doughnuts , the woven candle mat , the rag rug , and the yarn on the spindle are all projects that lily completed or is working on right now plus many , many more that girl can create up a cloud of dust when she gets in the frame of mind to do so she 's always got her fingers into a project of some sort ian is more interested in working with wood or repurposing things he gets that from him dad and a bit from me he made me the wooden coasters from a tree he cut down behind our house and gave them to me as a mother 's day gift so , yes , we spend a lot of our time making things here in our home maybe that 's foreign to some people , but i honestly could n't imagine not making that a priority for our family and i am absolutely certain that it is essential to me and my peace of mind it 's a big part of how i express myself i just feel like i must create which is one of the reasons i have recently took up watercolor painting again this summer i used to paint in high school and college and my hands down favorite medium was watercolor i recently started a nature journal which i am head over heels in love with because it is enabling me to practice painting again and learn and record so much about nature which is another favorite topic of mine now i suppose i need to find the time to pursue all of these creative goals projects this summer i have a rather good feeling that i will not accomplish near what i would like to because i do spend most days out of doors in the summer but there are always rainy days and nights around the campfire which lend to the making mood some other crafty plans i have i love this chevron crocheted bag these would be great for storage i love this shawl by cherry heart i need one of these on the side of my barn
