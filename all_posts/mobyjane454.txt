i posted the poem yesterday and realized i had memorized the second verse many years ago while i was booksigning today the verse kept repeating itself in my mind and was more helpful than i realized at first i had been saying to myself that i wanted to become a more loving person and not so judgmental , and yet how do you do that , action by action i was looking for something other than making distinctions between people as they passed by , as attractive or interesting or skinny or fat or short or tall or comfortably dressed or inappropriately dressed , and here was the answer my table was my house by the side of the road and i would not sit in the scorner 's bench or hurl the cynic 's ban but be a friend to man i kept thinking about that , just a friend , here i am , i can see myself as a friend to the people walking by it was quite amazing it is really a very loving place to be , waiting by the side of the road , a friend to man
