i was planning on writing a post about how well i continue to feel and function in fact , jet and i ran miles yesterday , and it was a good , doable run ! amazing that would not have been possible just two short weeks ago i was really pleased with the help of tms , i'm getting my life back that 's what i was going to write about but now i have something more pressing stuck on my mind i was just peeking briefly at facebook , it 's not something i spend a lot of time doing , and perhaps what follows is exactly the reason why a friend , who happens to be a nurse , posted this little ditty from quizzclub com my doctor asked if any of my family members suffered from mental illnesses i said no , they all seem to enjoy it in response , my friend received comments approving of her funny post and multiple likes , smiley faces , and even one heart emoji i , on the other hand , began to fume is anyone else offended by this post ? why is this funny ? if we substitute cancer , heart disease , or multiple sclerosis for mental illness , is this little ditty still funny ? i think not so much and that 's the point ! a biological illness which tears lives apart , disables people , and on many occasions leads to death is n't funny ! yet multiple viewers had no trouble , and presumably no second thought about pushing the like button i'm so angry and sad i tried to let it go i'm not a big facebook user , and i did n't want to create a scene or initiate some heated discussion which would likely end up pissing me off more than i cared to deal with , so i tried to let it go i could n't i just thought she should know better , and if she did n't know better i wanted to educate her i finally decided to at least send my friend a private message detailing my feelings and the reasons behind them this is what i wrote i do n't want to create a big scene on facebook , but allow me to say something about your 'enjoying mental illness' post i know you meant it lightheartedly , but as a person with severe , treatment resistant depression , an illness no different than any other in that it is an illness , i find that post short sighted and offensive my recent bout of depression tore my life apart and nearly outlasted my ability to stay alive i was in the hospital for days , suffered thru ect treatments , was unable to work , make any money , or pay my bills , and am now in the midst of weeks of daily transcranial magnetic stimulation tms treatments please think about it substitute any other illness cancer , heart disease , or ms , in place of mental illness in that little ditty is it still funny ? not so much just my thoughts as i attempt to combat the stigma surrounding mental illness thanks for listening my friend was sorry she offended me and said it was not her intent i know that i know it was n't her intent , or presumably the intent of quizzclub com , to offend anyone she found it funny she re posted a post that 's been viewed over million times already clearly she was n't the only one who thought it was cute or funny that 's the real problem how do we combat this pervasive sense that mental illness is something to be made light of rather than an illness to be taken seriously ? i do n't know what do you guys think ?
