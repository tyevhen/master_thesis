jim edwards has an interesting story about a stealth marketing campaign by johnson and johnson here 's a couple of snippets j and j unit centocor will next week launch an unadvertised documentary in movie theaters about patients with crohn s disease , rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis it is hoped the movie will trigger patients with these conditions to ask their doctors about remicade , a treatment for inflammatory disorders involving the immune system snip and the strategy is a significant change for the brand managers at centocor in , they placed million in consumer advertising behind the brand , according to nielsen monitor plus but in , that budget dropped to less than million now , without any above the line promotion , the company is hoping to attract an audience by encouraging support group members to attend screenings of the movies , which will be followed by a discussion it is also noted that no product is mentioned in the ad , hence my use of the term stealth marketing pharmalot also weighed in on the matter here 's a snippet this is a whole new dimension in direct to consumer advertising , counters jerry avorn , a harvard researcher and author of powerful medicines the benefits , risks and costs of prescription drugs what makes me edgy about it is if it is going to be a commercial , you should know it 's a commercial i'm very troubled by the blurring of the lines between advertising and patient education okay , we know dtc ads are under attack for flouting side effects and pushing consumers to ask their docs for meds they do n't need so j and j is being clever let 's give them that but let 's not pretend a 'documentary' is n't an ad when the producer has such a vested interest what 's next ? a broadway musical featuring children with adhd who sing and dance their way to a happy ending after taking concerta ? just an example of some of the good work you 'll find at brandweeknrx and pharmalot
