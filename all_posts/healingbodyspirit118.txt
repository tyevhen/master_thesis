i have osteoporosis just this week i found out i have osteoporosis who knew ? i eat almost no sugar and pretty low carbs however , that was not always true as a child i lived on sugar sugar sandwiches on white bread yuck ! on one corner of our street we had a root beer stand where we daily bought two penny mugs of frosted root beer on the other corner fat 's service station and he had the best selection of penny candy in town and we could eat all of the candy we could buy which was a lot at age nine i learned to make fudge straight sugar mixed with cocoa , and in addition , peanut brittle which was usually straight sugar without peanuts my siblings loved it two ended up with stage i diabetes and it was probably my fault but , to build our bone density we exercised a lot , mainly by jumping off the shed in the backyard with superman capes yes , we thought we could fly my sugar gulping days did n't end there as a teenager i lived on candy bars and my mother worked at a donut factory we had donuts for all three meals even after marriage i continued to bake brownies and cakes when i was in my thirties i had arthritis so severe i could hardly walk and every bone in my body ached my doctor tried to persuade me to give up sugar , but i thought , who are you kidding ? do you know who you are talking too ? finally , because of the pain , i gave up the sugar no more sugar , no more pain and no arthritis however , i continued to have substantial stress okay , tons of stress that made my body acidic better bones like an alkaline envirionment for my doctorate degree in holistic nutrition , better bones , better body , by susan brown , was part of the curriculum an alkaline diet , lots of green vegetables , promotes bone growth read my article on how i lost ten pounds in ten days it is the perfect diet for osteoporosis and i have already been on it a month another reason i have osteoporosis is because i have a growth on my parathyroid which is so deterimental to bone density i put off surgery for too long and am now planning surgery what else could i do i had been doing a younga yoga for a month , jumping on a minitramp , and some cardio my doctor recommended a personal trainer and i found that i was already doing many of the exercises she trainer recommended the next thing i did was sign up at our community spa and they have lots of weight training machines , so i am starting a five day a week weight training regimine i met with my friend who owns a health food store and found what i think are the ideal supplements to build bone density besides smy diet of green drinks juicing cucumber , celery and spinach , avacado shakes , and green soups and chlorophyl supplements include , nature 's way , alive calcium , and a vogel 's calcium asorption formula , and ipriflavone bone support formula in addition , i take silica , cal phos x remember , too much of the wrong kind of calcium can have side effects
