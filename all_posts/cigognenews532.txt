someone wrote me on facebook , a girlfriend i have not seen in decades we talked a long time , only to find out that she was in love with me she never told me but i also could not sense it because growing up unloved i had no idea what it was when i saw it , or at least unable to recognize it when it was in front of me and among my friends and patients most of us grew up unloved how strange when the most natural thing on earth is to grow up loved to be hugged and kissed by someone who is glad to see you , cherishes you and misses you when you are gone so many of us pass by love and the only way to avoid that is two fold either you get into my therapy and feel completely unloved when you do that you finally feel and then you can go and find love or , you find someone who loves you you finally know what it feels like and it opens you up to more of the same a rare occurrence because those of us who feel like shit never go straight for love we either need to buy it , offer the guy or girl some kind of reward or job or gift or we pursue her because we cannot imagine she would freely approach us we never expect it to be mutual , and when by chance it is , we manage to f k it up royally , all so we can feel unloved again it is like the gambling addiction not to win but to lose so we can try to win again we are addicted to the struggle for love , not love itself so many adults have so much neurosis that loving a child becomes almost impossible that is filling his need and not their own they want a smart kid , athletic child , passive , obedient one or more aggressive one whatever the parent need is becomes the child s destiny her life and her future he wants an obedient child and he gets it someone who cannot get going she cannot get a job or be aggressive in the market place because she is waiting for her orders something she got all of her life parents who cannot sit still have a hard time loving their child because they are too busy doing other things going and doing without cease they are driven by internal promptings , primal promptings that will not let them rest , nor relax enough to hug their child , play with him at length and be there to listen to be there for him they have to travel all the time to keep from feeling constrained at birth or after in the home , and so the child is again bereft parents too often lead the unexamined life they just go on doing what was done to them they demand obedience and no sassing from the children they expect to be obeyed without question the makings of a good nazi i was just following orders these parents haven t learned about feelings and their crucial importance and so many do not know that all that counts in life is to be loved and love back there is nothing else everything else is fioriture , gingerbread , topping on the cake but beyond that , and this is crucial , we need to grow up loved , valued , cherished , adored , kissed , cuddled and hug that is love it comes from feeling human beings and sets the whole tone for our lives with it we feel loved , secure , confident , open , optimistic and free without it , we spend a lifetime trying to overcome it we drug and drink so that the pain remains covered we don t really know we are in pain we just feel ill at ease , lousy , uncomfortable and icky in our skin and we cannot overcome it until we feel it and we cannot feel it until we know it is there and we cannot know it is there when we go to therapy because the therapist is in his head and doesn t know it is there too he became a shrink because his parents set him on the program he became smart and unloved and we cannot know it is there until we feel loved but diabolically , we never do , since feeling unloved supersedes it it washes any chance we have away we need to know we are in pain that is the first step then feel it and shred its effects then we are free free to feel loved at last
