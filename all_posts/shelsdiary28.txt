so i 've been asked out on two dates i bet your thinking 'fantastic ! go get 'em ! do it for us relationship bound bores ! ' well i'm not thinking any of those things i'm actually thinking that i really ca n't be arsed i know i'm being a cow , sometimes i like to be i text mr double date on monday i just thought i should , it 's not like i have loads of offers well i 've got two to be precise i thought i should just go for it you know , go with the flow then mr friends brother text and again , i thought 'why not ? ' there was some texts back and fourth i was going with the flow well the flow has now lead me to a decision making crossroads to date or not to date oh god , i am hating having to make any decisions at all at the moment this one could end me up in all sorts of drama i really cannot be bothered with although , one question that keeps playing on my mind is why not ? what 's an evening out , a drink , some texting ? all innocent fun , well it 's supposed to be fun even if i'm not feeling it at the moment and so , in the spirit of going with the flow i 've decided to take these two boys up on their offers i now have two dates lined up before my holiday playingthefield
