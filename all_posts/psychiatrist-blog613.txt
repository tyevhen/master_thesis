i 've been asked several 'ethical dilemmas' in the past few weeks i'm putting them up on shrink rap , but please do n't get hung up on the details these are n't my patients , but the details of the stories are being distorted to disguise those involved the question , in both cases , boils down to should the mental health professional report the patient to his professional board ? in the first case , a psychiatrist is treating a nurse who is behaving badly the nurse is stealing controlled substances from the hospital and giving them to friends who 'need' them she does n't intend to stop , and her contact with the psychiatrist was only for an appointment or two before she ended treatment should the psychiatrist contact the state 's nursing board ? is he even allowed to ? in the second case , a psychotherapist sees a patient who is also a psychotherapist i will call the patient here the patient therapist the patient tells the therapist he having a sexual relationship with one of his own patients the patient victim this is clearly unethical , but the patient victim is an adult and the relationship is consensual in that it is not forced or violent there is no question that if a licensing board knew of this , the patient therapist would lose his license should the treating therapist report his patient for unethical behavior ? ah , he asked a colleague on the board and was told that he must report this , and if he does n't , his own license could now be at risk if he now reports it , as instructed , can the patient therapist turn around and sue him for breaching his confidentiality ? after all , he was seeking help with his problem , he believed it was protected information , and now he will be sanctioned out of a livelihood does it matter if the therapist is a physician for example , a psychiatrist as opposed to a psychologist or social worker or nurse practitioner ? i realize that all mental health professionals have confidentiality standards , but are the confidentiality laws that apply to physicians clergy attorneys the same as they are for other mental health professionals ?
