in contrast to higher life forms , bacteria usually have compact genomes , with few duplicate genes and very little non coding dna but some bacteria , for reasons not entirely understood , accumulate relatively large genomes a good example is sorangium cellulosum , a soil dweller of the myxococcales group , whose million base pair genome comprising , protein coding genes dwarfs that of e coli b with million base pairs and , genes and makes the gene genome of mycoplasma genitalium look puny bear in mind that the fruit fly genome contains about , protein genes although several times that number of proteins may be produced through alternative splicing of exons exactly why s cellulosum needs more genes than , for example , baker 's yeast with million base pairs and around , genes is anybody 's guess it does have many accessory genes for producing secondary metabolites with interesting antifungal , antibacterial , and other properties including anti tumor properties as a result , many labs are busy mining the sorangium genome for genes of possible commercial importance sorangium cellulosum i recently decided to poke around inside the genome of s cellulosum myself , looking for evidence of latent secondary structure internal complementarity regions in its genes i was stunned at what i found when i had my scripts look for complementing intragenic mers pairs of complementary sequencces of length , i found over , such pairs in sorangium 's genes next , i went a step further and checked each gene for internal complementing sequences of length based on sorangium 's actual a , g , c , and t composition stats , and considering all the kinds of mers that actually exist in the coding regions of the genome , i expected to find matching complementing pairs of mers in , genes what i actually found were , matching pairs inside , genes to make this clearer , i plotted the expected number of complementary mers per gene versus the actual number per gene , in a graph expected vs actual complementing intragenic mers for sorangium expectation statistics were calculated individually , for each gene , based on actual a , g , c , t composition stats and gene length the points are arrayed in horizontal lines because while expectations can be calculated to several decimal points , actual occurrences are discrete whole numbers it 's fairly evident that length complementary pairs tend to occur at higher than the expected rates in fact , that 's true for of occurrences it might not be obvious from the above plot that of points lie above the slope line , but that 's only because so many points overlap each other the bottom line ? these results strongly suggest that substantial amounts of secondary structure exist in a significant fraction of sorangium 's genes the secondary structure could be tied to thermal regulation of gene expression via rna thermometers , or some mrnas could incorporate metallo sensitive riboswitches or maybe secondary structure in mrna is important for certain translocon targeted genes there could be other explanations as well if you have one , leave a comment why is this important ? for one thing , we need a better understanding of how an organism with , protein genes regulates and coordinates gene expression secondary structure of regulatory and coding region rna might well hold important clues but also , if secondary structure is conserved in large numbers of genes as i believe it is , it has to affect codon bias complementing codons would be preferred at least for certain regions over non complementing codons , and this would affect codon choice it 's a factor that has not been considered , to date , in arguments over why codon bias exists
