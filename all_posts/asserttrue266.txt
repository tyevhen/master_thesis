a maddening problem in genome annotation is determining the sense strand for a gene , especially when the gene is short and or the genome has a high gc content and thus contains few or no stop codons in reverse translation to convince yourself this is a very real and serious problem , all you have to do is browse a few genomes to see the ridiculously high number of hypothetical proteins over in some genomes , bogus overlaps , genes that score blast hits in reverse complement mode but not frame zero , and other artifacts that are a direct result of the aforesaid problem i 've presented examples of this problem before , but just so there 's no confusion , i want to show you a particularly maddening example so you can see what i'm talking about then i 'll suggest a solution the following graphic shows a region of e coli uti in which several genes are shown as overlapping that is to say , existing on opposite strands of dna in the same coverage area small overlaps sometimes happen between genes , but whole genes rarely , if ever , overlap , and never in clusters the situation shown below is bogus , but you see it all the time in public genomes in fact , some of the genes shown below also show up as overlaps in mycobacterium abscessus m see gene ouw , citrobacter koseri strain atcc baa gene cko , and quite a few others glimmer has choked on this exact situation many times , in many genomes a region with overlapping genes in the genome of e coli uti the big gene on the top strand , middle , is uti c dna sequence here it 's annotated as what else ? a hypothetical protein the m abscessus version of the gene here is marked as a cellobiose phosphorylase , and you can find many blast hits the rothia version gives an e value of for similar cellobiose phosphorylase genes in other organisms at uniprot org and elsewhere of course , they 're all bogus and represent glimmer choke points , but the question is how one can determine that , and be sure about it e coli 's hypothetical protein uti c has a wobble base gc percentage of , whereas the gene on the opposite strand just below it , pointing left , namely uti c marked as membrane bound atp synthase f sector alpha subunit , has gc in a much higher gc organism like mycobacterium or pseudomonas , you would find out which gene has the higher gc percentage and crown it the winner and most of the time , you 'd be right in this case , it 's not so simple the gene with the higher gc value is n't necessarily the winner of course , in this particular example , you can cheat and look at the identities of the genes in the immediate vicinity of the hypothetical protein , on the bottom strand , and if you do , you 'll find that all of the bottom strand genes are atpase subunits mystery solved , right ? sure , in this particular case but what about situations where overlapping genes are all shown as hypothetical protein ? you can find many such cases in the genome for burkholderia pseudomallei strain b , for example when a hypothetical overlaps a hypothetical in a low gc genome , then what ? one of my favorite cheats but this is n't the final solution ! is to check the gene 's ag percentage adenine plus guanine , codon base one this percentage averages in something like of protein coding genes the problem is , ag is often whether you read the gene forward , or backward off the antisense strand the reverse complement of a gene usually has high ag , because the forward ag is usually under almost any trick you can dream up will fail under edge cases gc is helpful , but only in high gc genomes ag is helpful , but only sometimes shine dalgarno signals are not universally used by all organisms , and even in those that do use them , they 're usually reserved for highly conserved genes encoding things like ribosomal proteins gene context is helpful in some cases but not others it turns out , the best clue for positively identifying the correct strand and correct reading frame is codon usage frequency patterns if you know what the codon frequencies are , genome wide , for a given organism , you can use this information to good advantage , even if the genome and therefore the codon table contains inaccuracies as long as the codon frequencies are approximately correct , you can use them to verify the reading frame of a protein coding gene the algorithm i came up with is very simple , yet effective for a given gene , read each triplet of bases sequentially , and score each triplet twice keep two scores going first , score it according to its frequency in the codon table for the organism then score it according to a second table developed for reverse complement codons the following table shows codon frequencies in caulobacter crescentus na if you were to encounter a hypothetical protein gene in caulobacter , and you could n't decide whether the strand assignment was correct or not , first develop a score for the gene by reading its triplets and adding the frequency value of the corresponding codon to the running total for example , if you encounter the triplet ctg , add to the score see table for every occurrence of ctt , add , for ctc add , and so on , using the values in the table codon frequencies for caulobacter crescentus na but you also have to create an anticodon frequency table as follows for every codon in the original table , apply the same score to the corresponding reverse complement codon in the antcodon table e g , for ctg , the first table would contain as above , but the value would apply to cag the reverse complement of ctg in the second table i call the first table the forward table and the second table the back table one represents the frequencies of codons encountered in protein genes in the forward reading direction the other represents those same frequencies applied to the reverse complement of the codons the same codons read in the reverse direction , off the opposite dna strand when scoring an unknown gene , you tally a forward table score , and keep a separate score using the back table when you 're done , the gene 's forward table score should be greater than the back table score if it 's not , you 're reading the gene off the wrong strand when i scored all , c crescentus cb genes using this technique , i found genes that gave a back score higher than the forward score interestingly , when i checked the identities of those putative backwards annotated genes , of them were listed as hypothetical proteins only four genes with assigned functions gave suspect scores , and one of those cc turns out to be a identity match for the reverse of gene ccna in caulobacter crescenstus na the other three are less than bases long and could well be non coding regions for a more challenging test , i turned to the genome of rothia mucilaginosa dy , one of the most disastrous annotation nightmares of all time in the genome for dy you will find protein coding genes out of , total that are involved in significant overlaps some overlaps are on , some are on but the genome is almost certainly overannotated by at least genes i trained my program on the codon usage table of r mucilaginosa m which contains fewer overlaps than dy , then tallied codon and anticodon scores on all of dy 's cds genes in the end , genes gave scores indicative of a reversed reading frame of those , were , in fact , involved in overlaps codon scoring is such an effective method , i do n't know why programs like glimmer do n't use it it 's quite obvious they 're not using it , though , because every genome has reverse annotated genes by the hundreds , in some cases that are easily detected using this simple method here , for the record , are the caulobacter crescentus cb genes that appear to be annotated on the wrong strand cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc
