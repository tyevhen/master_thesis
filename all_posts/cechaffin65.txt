within fifteen minutes of awakening this morning or should i say rising from bed ? i prolong my mornings by resisting the upright position , i wept for nothing just a melancholic seizure afterwards i realized i need not trash the day because of it i can still write this blog i can do the dishes i can do the wash i hope my wife does n't see this , but she rarely reads my blog here 's a quote from the radical he walked on and on , his hands clasped behind his back , his shoulders stooped , his large head inclined forward slightly , a woe begone expression on his dark face as if all the misery of the world were weighing on his shoulders , as if the wail of the winds on the lake were the voices of the hungry and the poor , calling out to him to right their wrongs i was looking for a quote from lincoln , when he said something like if all the misery of the world were gathered in one sack and put upon one man 's shoulders , i am that man if anyone knows the true quote please send it along i had three poems accepted by tryst , one by the pedestal , one by blue fifth review and four published in the anthology , heart 's content when links are available i 'll alert you here or on facebook facebook has in so many ways supplanted e mail and blogging , as has twitter do you tweet ? can your life be squeezed into characters ? are you really that important and busy ? i 've tweeted a few times , i have about twenty followers , but i do n't know who they are or if they read what i write it seems like pissing blind into the ether as part of my discipline in depression , i wrote a formal poem once more for sanity to not think about oneself , to not think thoughts at all , not to name absent objects like a green hat , a silver cane , a tub of margarine , not to think how thought winds upon itself as in a golf ball s center or a plantar wart to limp on see ? thought pains itself why remember ? remember what ? self loss , of course , that your derivation supersedes your contrivance , that what sacred force you assign identity concedes to all the barkers monologues extant in carnivals where you were resident always the question of identity , how much is construct and how much imitation ? and why ask such questions unless a psychologist or depressed ? kilorats , dr chaffin
