being a senior citizen , i had cpr training in the boy scouts , the u s navy , and twice by the red cross sponsored by my employer i was taught to use the a b c method airway breath compression in , the process was changed the new method is spelled out below there are some videos available on the internet as well as red cross courses to train you should you wish to learn the new method cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr is an emergency procedure , performed in an effort to manually preserve intact brain function until further measures are taken to restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing in a person in cardiac arrest it is indicated in those who are unresponsive with no breathing or abnormal breathing , for example , agonal respirations cpr involves chest compressions at least cm deep and at a rate of at least per minute in an effort to create artificial circulation by manually pumping blood through the heart in addition , the rescuer may provide breaths by either exhaling into the subject 's mouth or nose or utilizing a device that pushes air into the subject 's lungs this process of externally providing ventilation is termed artificial respiration current recommendations place emphasis on high quality chest compressions over artificial respiration a simplified cpr method involving chest compressions only is recommended for untrained rescuers cpr alone is unlikely to restart the heart its main purpose is to restore partial flow of oxygenated blood to the brain and heart the objective is to delay tissue death and to extend the brief window of opportunity for a successful resuscitation without permanent brain damage administration of an electric shock to the subject 's heart , termed defibrillation , is usually needed in order to restore a viable or perfusing heart rhythm cpr is generally continued until the patient has a return of spontaneous circulation rosc or is declared dead effectiveness used alone , cpr will result in few complete recoveries , and those who do survive often develop serious complications estimates vary , but many organizations stress that cpr does not bring anyone back , it simply preserves the body for defibrillation and advanced life support however , in the case of non shockable rhythms such as pulseless electrical activity pea , defibrillation is not indicated , and the importance of cpr rises on average , only of people who receive cpr survive the purpose of cpr is not to start the heart , but rather to circulate oxygenated blood , and keep the brain alive until advanced care especially defibrillation can be initiated studies have shown that immediate cpr followed by defibrillation within minutes of sudden vf cardiac arrest improves survival in cities such as seattle where cpr training is widespread and defibrillation by ems personnel follows quickly , the survival rate is about percent in cities such as new york , without those advantages , the survival rate is only percent compression only cpr is less effective in children ages than in adults , as cardiac arrest in children is more likely to have a non cardiac cause cpr for children is different please follow this link for more information https www nlm nih gov medlineplus ency article htm remember the basics call or have someone else call for you ask someone to find an aed automated external defibulator start chest compressions by pushing hard and fast on the lower half of the breastbone the rate should be at least presses per minute and approximately inches deep the song stayin alive has about a beats per minute keep up the compressions until the aed or emergency response team arrives advice from the american heart association untrained if you 're not trained in cpr , then provide hands only cpr that means uninterrupted chest compressions of about a minute until paramedics arrive described in more detail below you do n't need to try rescue breathing trained , and ready to go if you 're well trained and confident in your ability , begin with chest compressions instead of first checking the airway and doing rescue breathing start cpr with chest compressions before checking the airway and giving rescue breaths trained , but rusty if you 've previously received cpr training but you 're not confident in your abilities , then just do chest compressions at a rate of about a minute details described below if trained , practice the c a b process the american heart association uses the acronym of cab circulation , airway , breathing to help people remember the order to perform the steps of cpr circulation restore blood circulation with chest compressions put the person on his or her back on a firm surface kneel next to the person 's neck and shoulders place the heel of one hand over the center of the person 's chest , between the nipples place your other hand on top of the first hand keep your elbows straight and position your shoulders directly above your hands use your upper body weight not just your arms as you push straight down on compress the chest at least inches approximately centimeters push hard at a rate of about compressions a minute if you have n't been trained in cpr , continue chest compressions until there are signs of movement or until emergency medical personnel take over if you have been trained in cpr , go on to checking the airway and rescue breathing airway clear the airway if you 're trained in cpr and you 've performed chest compressions , open the person 's airway using the head tilt , chin lift maneuver put your palm on the person 's forehead and gently tilt the head back then with the other hand , gently lift the chin forward to open the airway check for normal breathing , taking no more than five or seconds look for chest motion , listen for normal breath sounds , and feel for the person 's breath on your cheek and ear gasping is not considered to be normal breathing if the person is n't breathing normally and you are trained in cpr , begin mouth to mouth breathing if you believe the person is unconscious from a heart attack and you have n't been trained in emergency procedures , skip mouth to mouth rescue breathing and continue chest compressions breathing breathe for the person rescue breathing can be mouth to mouth breathing or mouth to nose breathing if the mouth is seriously injured or ca n't be opened with the airway open using the head tilt , chin lift maneuver , pinch the nostrils shut for mouth to mouth breathing and cover the person 's mouth with yours , making a seal prepare to give two rescue breaths give the first rescue breath lasting one second and watch to see if the chest rises if it does rise , give the second breath if the chest does n't rise , repeat the head tilt , chin lift maneuver and then give the second breath thirty chest compressions followed by two rescue breaths is considered one cycle resume chest compressions to restore circulation if the person has not begun moving after five cycles about two minutes and an automatic external defibrillator aed is available , apply it and follow the prompts administer one shock , then resume cpr starting with chest compressions for two more minutes before administering a second shock if you 're not trained to use an aed , a or other emergency medical operator may be able to guide you in its use use pediatric pads , if available , for children ages through do not use an aed for babies younger than age if an aed is n't available , go to step below continue cpr until there are signs of movement or
