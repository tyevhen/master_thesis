now , there are some things you should probably know about my food and cooking preferences before i jump into this post , and share a couple of vague i rarely measure recipes i firmly believe that kale is the greatest leafy green ever it 's one of the first veggies you can get at the farmers market in early spring and one of the last in late fall it 's extremely healthy , and it actually tastes good i should mention at this point that i'm not a big fan of most greens , so that 's saying something ! i love asian inspired food i love tamari soy sauce i eating food in these awesome , perfectly large sized clear glass bowls we have eating food out of them makes me feel all happy and cozy now on to the food ! stir fried kale with quinoa pretty simple really i chop up some kale chopping up the leaves and stalks separately and some bell pepper , cook it with tamari soy sauce , water , and a bit of this seasoning powder called nonya which is made up of onions , garlic , chillies , and lemon , adding chopped kale stalks first and cooking for several minutes before adding the leaves , then after another few minutes the pepper , to make sure that everything is cooked enough to become tender , but not too soft when done , serve over warm quinoa vegetable chow mein about smallish stalks of kale , leaves stalks chopped up separately medium onion , sliced some baby bok choy maybe half of a head ? , white part and leaves used , sliced small red bell peppers , cut into smallish pieces small hot pepper , ribs seeds removed , chopped finely a bunch of thin egg noodles about or g uncooked tamari soy sauce i just add it by what looks and tastes right ! about tsp salt about tsp sugar olive oil or other vegetable oil , for cooking toasted sesame oil in a large frying pan , put enough veggie oil to cover the bottom of the pan add kale stalks not leaves ! and let cook for a few minutes if i do n't let them cook longer than the other ingredients , they end up tough add kale leaves , onion , and hot pepper , adding more oil as if necessary sometime during first two steps , cook egg noodles as instructed on package then rinse in cold water and set aside when onions are fairly soft and kale looks nearly done add the bok choy and bell pepper continuing to add oil on an as needed basis continue cooking for a couple of minutes , until bok choy and pepper are lightly cooked , crispy yet tender put the cooked veggies in a large pot i use the same one i cooked the noddles in , along with the noodles , enough veggie oil that everything wo n't stick , a splash of sesame oil , the salt and sugar , and the soy sauce stir until everything is warmed through and the noodles are just starting to stick to the bottom of the pan , and serve ! i made this for supper tonight , and every single picky family member enjoyed it ! garlic noodle soup veggie stock with some water , tamari soy sauce , nonya seasoning powdered onions , garlic , chillies , and lemon , makes up the broth then i fry with a bit of oil then water added as needed kale , bell peppers , onions , and lots of garlic this is the type of soup i like to eat when sick until tender , add to soup broth , add uncooked noodles to soup and cook until ready , then eat and enjoy sushi salad this is what i eat when i feel like sushi , but do n't feel like spending the two hours needed to make it ! it 's pretty simple sticky rice sushi rice chopped up cucumbers , bell peppers , avocado , and any other veggies i like i my sush torn up nori seaweed sweet pickled ginger and as a dressing equal parts rice vinegar seasoned or plain and tamari soy sauce a pinch of sugar wasabi powder to taste i'm assuming fresh would be better , it just seems i only have powdered left every time i make this mix it all up , and enjoy the yummy ness ! ! i love experimenting with food , never following recipes exactly , making up my own recipes , and just having fun with it i hope the stuff i 've shared here can maybe inspire you to go make some yummy food of your own !
