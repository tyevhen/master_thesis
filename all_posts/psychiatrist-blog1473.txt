so laura starts by announcing it 's her final session how do you feel ? from both parties laura goes on to discuss how a year old nearly died during a simple surgery apparently , laura 's an anesthesia resident the attending was out of the room and laura had never taken a patient to recovery alone before and she did n't know what to do huh ? ? this brings us back to when laura was a tender year old her mother died and she talks about a relationship with a couple she stayed with that summer in california we thought she never saw them again oh , but now she says the husband stayed at her house or at the hay adams hotel in dc , for months while he while he had a trial going on , and laura had sex with him every day when she 'd previously told paul that her first was a kid in high school , that had been a lie hard to know what 's true here paul gets angry that the year old man who 'd slept with her had a moral obligation to say no it seems he 's talking to himself laura needs a drink , something other than water all these characters do is drink and go to the bathroom and they linger over the espresso maker that paul 's patient alex , who is also laura 's lover , has given him and oh , the year old girl on the operating table almost died because laura made a mistake because she was thinking about paul good bye and a lingering hug that leaves us wondering , but finally laura exits good riddance i have nothing to add okay , it 's alex 's turn now he 's obnoxious , aggressive and hostile he picks at paul , constantly asking how he feels , asking if he 's slept with laura , insisting that therapy is reciprocal and do n't you see how you twist things ? paul wants alex to talk about his father , and this does not go well alex has done his research we 'll call this stalking he knows paul 's wife was in italy having an affair , that his daughter is sleeping with drug addicts , and when he refers to patient laura as a slut , well that 's when paul loses it and physically assaults alex he throws his coffee and calls him a prick end of session this is drama , it 's not psychotherapy nothing even close to this ever goes on in my office and i'm starting to wish i was more like roy there are some things started that should not be finished the whole thing stunk and as i watched , i peeled and de veined shrimp for dinner
