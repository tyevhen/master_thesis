so i just told my husband it would be best not to talk to me this morning last night was rough our children well i am convinced they are trying to kill us slowly tortuously there is a reason that sleep deprivation is used as a form of torture for the past years , john and i have been living proof of why i was one of those parents who when they first heard samuel l jackson 's narration of go the f to sleep , actually fell asleep ! ha , just kidding , but there have been many times that i have wanted to read it to my kids , no matter how inappropriate if you are easily offended , please skip the video after last night , i am a bit out of it jack , who is five , sleeps through the night approximately three nights a week seriously luckily , when he wakes these days , he is usually pretty easy to get back down that did n't used to be the case let 's just say that when he was about months old i spent approximately months sleeping on a mattress on the floor of his nursery trying to get him to accept his crib i have read all the sleep books tried all of the methods notta crying it out ? i did that once an hour and minutes in he was hyperventilating and so was i so to put it mildly , we have struggled with this issue a lot and of course , until i learned more about asperger 's , i did n't know that sleep disturbances are a very common symptom i remember at one point when johnson and johnson came out with their lavender bath products and advertised helps baby sleep better , john looked at me with a ridiculous amount of hope in his eyes our kid smelled fabulous when he was screaming in the middle of the night now we use epsom salts i do n't really think that 's doing anything either next step will be melatonin , which i have heard wonderful things about , but we shall see i mean this is the kid who gets hyperactive with benadryl , so who knows nathan oh nathan he has always been the good sleeper since the day we brought him home from the hospital until now last week when we were in bethany he boycotted the pack n play , and in the interest of everyone sleeping and having a nice vacation , we let him into bed with us of course this was a big mistake of course i knew this because he may have autism , but more importantly , he is and he is becoming mr obstinate now , i am told by his aba teachers , doctors , etc , that being naughty is a really good sign he is thinking independently , knows what he wants , is communicating , etc and in theory i completely agree i invite all of these parties to join me in the middle of the night mr nate has been up since this morning yup good luck to those teachers today we have been very lucky , he has n't figured out how to climb out of the crib yet , but i can feel it , it 's coming i keep finding him screaming with his little leg up on the rail , his curtains pulled into the crib , all toys out he is plotting , haha so of course about half an hour in to nate 's shenanigans we hear a thud and looked at each other oh crap and then running there 's jack ! even at am he runs into the room mommy , daddy , jack and natey , we are all p 's and we are all black and is your propeller spinning , how many blades do you have , are you taking off ? ughh daddy got the easier end of the deal last night , he took jack back to bed and they were both almost instantly back to sleep nate had lots of fun kicking me in the head , pushing up my shirt and grabbing my post baby belly he loves my skin for some reason , great for the self esteem , ha and throwing his cup at me and saying more over and over again finally at i decided that he was going to have to cry it out and he did out , and out and out he never calmed on a positive note , he was screaming go quite a bit and when i went in to reassure him and was leaving he yelled no go amazing the language that pops in when he 's really angry so as i am writing this , both boys are lying on the floor with droopy eyelids fantastic bet their sitter will get a great nap out of them today and then they will be ready for more fun tonight to the it department at my job if i should call today and tell you that my laptop shorted out because i spilled a glass of water on it i am lying i actually drooled on it while holding my eyes open with toothpicks sorry about that
