traveling safely and comfortably are two of the more difficult problems associated with kennedy s disease as it progresses for me i had to retire early because travel became out of the question and my job required a lot of travel one thing i found out early on was that many hotels believe a couple of grab bars in the bathroom makes the room handicap accessible of course , i wasn t savvy enough to ask the right questions either what i now know is it is important to find out exactly what the hotel deems accessible and , for you to explain what your needs are there is a good article at disaboom written by candy harrington that a friend sent to me the other day finding an accessible room beyond ada compliance provides a couple of dozen bullet points about what to look for , what to ask , and who to ask i recommend that you print the article and refer to it whenever you are considering any travel some recommendations i have listed below some of the recommendations mentioned in the article and some of my comments never just ask for an accessible room instead , list the access features you need i e , a roll in shower if tubs are no longer safe to step in and out of or an elevated toilet seat in the u s , look for hotels constructed after , the date the americans with disabilities act ada took effect always call the hotel directly on site reservation agents often have first hand knowledge about access features at their property if you feel the front desk person does not know the answer , ask for the manager ask the reservation agent to describe the access features of the room don t settle for the broad description of ada compliant ask for specific access details many properties have raised toilet seats that can be installed in any bathroom accessible toilets are inches high , so if you need a higher one , ask about a raised toilet seat or , do as i do and bring a seat riser with you tallette don t be afraid to ask for measurements if door width is a concern , ask for that measurement do n't forget about interior bathroom door width , too if walking any distance is a factor , request a room near the elevator remember to ask the reservation agent if the accessible room can be blocked for you if the answer is no or usually , then find another hotel bed height is not regulated under the ada , so make sure to ask for bed measurements many properties are replacing their standard mattresses with high pillow top models travel doesn t have to be a hardship if you plan ahead and ask the right questions have a good trip !
