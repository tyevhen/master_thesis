mihaly csikszentmihalyi , author of flow the psychology of optimal experience , tells us that individuals who push themselves out of their comfort zones , often report greater fulfillment and success in life instead of withdrawing to the safety of what is familiar when they do n't get immediate results , they force themselves to move forward , through awkwardness , discomfort and anxiety until such feelings subside and when that happens , a new experience is achieved joe gilliam , a professional motivator and writer of the audiobook the winner in you , agrees and explains that there are barriers that keep us from making important life changes that could lead us to success here are his six barrier the best i could do example you tell yourself , i never wanted to be in sales i wanted to be a pilot , but this was the best i could do solution just because that was the best you could do at that given point in your life does n't mean that 's where you have to stay now you have the power to make changes that can alter your future , gilliam notes start making lists of things you want to do and be in your future and dream big ! barrier the talks a lot barrier example millions of wannabe writers talk endlessly about the great book they 're going to write the problem is they do more talking than writing ! soon they 've talked their book away and no longer have the desire to put it on paper solution make a commitment to talk about your dream no more than one hour a week , and only then to people who can actually help you achieve it however , you can talk about what you 've actually done toward your dream all you want barrier psychology of entitlement example you believe , i deserve it they owe it to me i'm entitled to it because you feel so entitled , it 's likely that you 're not putting in the work necessary to achieve whatever it is you want solution be aware that your feeling of entitlement will cripple your chances for success you have to have internal drive to reach your goal , gilliam declares you ca n't wait for someone to hand it to you barrier afraid to fail example you 've hated your management job for years and long to own your own business , but you 've never tried because you 're afraid you wo n't be successful solution first , realize that this is the no barrier that keeps people stuck inside their comfort zones but studies of highly successful people show that they actually experience far more failures than those less successful ! the difference is , they refuse to be defeated by setbacks , disappointments or failures they never stop pursuing their dreams , gilliam notes unsuccessful people give up early and settle for less barrier ca n't decide barrier example you work at a job below your potential because you just ca n't decide what great career to go after and you do n't want to pick the wrong one and miss a fantastic opportunity solution understand that indecision is keeping you from taking action missed opportunities only limit you if you dwell upon those in the past instead of looking for the ones ahead opportunities are not being rationed , gilliam says barrier procrastination a k a living in somedayland example you swear you 're going to make a major career change someday , but first you 've got to get all your credit cards paid off or lose pounds or get your kids through school there 's always a but first or if or someday , i 'll in your statements about your goals solution stop putting off your dreams focus on what 's really important to you and make that your first priority do n't end up as a person with a 'but first ' complex , gilliam advises many people live a steady diet of 'if' and 'but 's if 'if' and 'but 's were candy and nuts , some people would have christmas every day ! my cents i believe that perserverence is a great thing to include in your toolbelt of qualities if you have that quality , use it if it is an underdeveloped one , build it and bulk it up i consider many of the successes and joys in my life to be a result of my stretching far from my comfort zone editorial note at pm being in crisis or trauma sometimes requires the need for a person to be and stay in a comfort zone as such , stretching out of it would not be recommended resting and refueling would be the goal thanks to traci and dreaming again for highlighting that point to me
