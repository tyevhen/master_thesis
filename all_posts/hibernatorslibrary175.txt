quiet the power of introverts in a world that ca n't stop talking , by susan cain quiet is cain 's celebration of introversion she discusses how america is a world of extroverts and that introverts are encouraged to be extroverts against their personalities this is a society that does not appreciate introverts through interviews and personal experience , she provides scientific and anecdotal evidence that introverts can provide just as much or more to society as extroverts i really wanted to like quiet everybody seems to and at the beginning i did after all , i'm an introvert , at least i consider myself one despite the personality test that i took in a previous post and that gets me to my first point what is an introvert ? cain , and most others , define introverts as people who are drained by interpersonal interaction and need time to rejuvenate after a social situation extroverts are charged by socializing but this is very black and white what about the people like me who are on the extroversion scale ? i do need to rejuvenate after too much socialization , but i also seek out social situations i do not seem to fit in her nice little structure cain briefly approaches this issue in her book , but i'm not sure most people care about the difference another issue i had with the book is that it provided so much anicdotal scientific research do n't get me wrong the research was fascinating i just gobble that stuff up but then i realized that she did n't really seem to understand the implication of the research , and therefore the findings she presented were n't very trustworthy one example is that she discussed an experiment in which people were forced to smile by placing a pencil in their mouths then they watched a sad video the people who were forced to smile felt much more cheerful after the video than the people who did not have pencils in their mouths but later in that experiment , those same people those who felt better after wearing the pencil were more likely to react poorly to another sad video than the people who had not been forced to smile during the first video thus it s bad to suppress your emotions , because you will feel worse later then in the same chapter , she talked about another experiment in which people could not produce an angry face because of an injection of botox when anger was stimulated , the people who could express their angry face were left feeling more angry after the experiment than those were were n't able to express their angry face thus it is bad to express your emotions because you will feel worse later note the contradiction ? another issue that bothered me about this book is her tendency to generalize a small population with the gigantic and diverse continent of asia in one study she quoted , the researchers compared the reactions of people from hong kong to the people of israel , and found israelis more willing to express their emotions but cain referred to the people from hong kong a teensy tiny bit of asia as asians she referred to the people of israel a slightly larger territory as israelis israel , by the way is in asia before you generalize , ms cain , make sure you know your geography the last thing that bothered me about this book is that i felt it praised introverts to point of degrading extroverts yes , she continuously pointed out that both were needed , but i think if that were the case , she might have done a better job of showing how both are necessary to have a successful culture snowflakes for being an interesting read despite the weak points
