what an unstable little world i 've been living in lately my mood has been on an up and down journey as of late while i'm still feeling better overall , as i noted in my last post , i 've suffered through some awful lows this week as usual , there 's been no rhyme or reason to it one afternoon i crashed after having a relatively good day i woke up one morning near tears but felt a bit better by the evening one night i barely slept because i felt so low , but by morning i was okay it 's weird it 's uncomfortable , and i do n't like it much during the lows , i 've had to work really hard to keep my frustration in check those of you who walk in my shoes know how difficult it is to not fear the worst when the bottom hits i 've been trying to focus my energy on the good times , putting one foot in front of the other during the low times , and doing what i can no matter my fickle mood it 's been a challenge today has been a good day i ran my last long run prior to the upcoming chicago marathon i ran miles , which was really important , as i missed two scheduled runs this week when i could n't garner enough energy to get out the door those were low days i was so pleased with myself after running , i treated myself to a dairy queen blizzard , which i did n't need , but it was oh , so delicious i spent the rest of my day running errands , napping , and watching football it was , as i said , a good day i'm grateful for my good day and i'm hoping my fortune continues and the ups outnumber the downs in the days to come whatever comes my way , i'm committed to ride it out i'm tired of fighting the lows , but the alternative , giving in to them , is not a palatable idea either so i might as well continue to fight eventually , i'm going to beat this damn illness i hope
