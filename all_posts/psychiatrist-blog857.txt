week sunil frances jesse adele week sunil frances jesse adele week sunil frances jesse adele week sunil frances jesse adele week sunil frances jesse adele grand rounds in the medical blogosphere will be on gratitude this week roy wants me to write a post on gratitude clinkshrink wants me to write a book about in treatment i am grateful i have friends to help me figure out how to spend my time and keep me off the streets does this count ? perhaps the grand rounds folks would like to read about in treatment ? great line , adele to paul at a certain point , you have to move past the stories you 've assigned to your life paul says he lacks passion , something that everyone else has adele , he says , has passion for this , this being her work at first it seems a bit narcissistic paul is assuming she loves her work , because her work , after all , is talking to him , and no one wants to think that their therapist hates coming to work but then we learn that paul has googled adele , and part of why he assumes she loves her work is because she 's written a lot she must have passion adele is a bit stiff for my taste i like animated people but she 's a good therapist for a fictional character she 's attentive and able to distill patterns , and she has good insights so just as i'm thinking that adele is such a much better example of a therapist than paul is because she does n't get in his face and say confrontational , contentious things , she blows it paul talks about how caring for his sick mother stifled his childhood , and adele proposes that he may have used this as an excuse to hide he says no , this does n't feel right , but adele insists it is i hate it when they do that finally , paul was distracted during sex this afternoon you knew he was thinking about adele , that he has become attracted to her , and in this episode her eyes have become so much more flirtatious new makeup or camera angles , i suppose ? and at the end of the session , he tells her she 's right when she says he holds back , and he tells her he 's been thinking about her during sex with his girlfriend textbook transference , he says , as though being a therapist himself should make him above all that it 's a compelling session , and we 're left to wonder if adele can hold her boundaries we think so and what will happen next week i'm grateful that someone somewhere might be interested in my thoughts on a tv show thank you for reading !
