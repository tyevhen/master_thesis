disclaimer i am not an investment advisor before entering into any trading strategy based on anything presented here , consult a qualified professional or better yet , half a dozen of them this post is meant to be educational , not advisory with that out of the way , let me explain an investment tactic i have sometimes used with great results none of this will be news to an experienced investor it will be news to some going into last night 's amazon earnings report , i was holding some shares of amazon accumulated during the big market down move of earlier this month naturally , i wanted to protect those shares against a sudden price drop like the one that happened after the previoous earnings report , days ago i bought put options a bearish bet late in the day yesterday , fearing that a bad report from amazon would move the stock lower just to review a put is a contract that gives you the right to sell a particular stock at a predetermined price the so called strike price during a particular time frame i bought the december amzn put , strike price , yesterday afternoon when the stock was trading around the strike means the put was out of the money because it was so far out of the money , the put was relatively inexpensive , at times shares , plus commission , per contract last night , after amazon announced its million loss cents a share much more than the cent loss the street was expecting , the stock price fell sharply it opened this morning down , at it rebounded to within a few minutes my put contract went from being out of the money to in the money its price rose from to , a overnight gain taking a naked short position is risky , but in reality i was using the put to protect shares of the actual stock it was a hedge , in other words this same hedigng tactic paid off handsomely for me three months ago , at the last amazon earnings call , which also moved the stock down about a share will it happen again ? no one knows but we do know that earnings announcements often cause sudden dramatic moves in stock prices , particularly with tech stocks options are not for every investor they decay in price quite rapidly over time , they 're subject to huge price moves , and if you 're not careful you can lose part or all of your money if you decide to look into options , educate yourself thoroughly on the risks the risks can be substantial but so can the rewards
