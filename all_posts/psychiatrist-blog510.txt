in the washington post , april , , psychiatry 's bible , the dsm , is doing more harm than good , paula j caplan writes about a year ago , a young mother called me , extremely distressed she had become seriously sleep deprived while working full time and caring for her dying grandmother every night when a crisis at her son s day care center forced her to scramble to find a new child care arrangement , her heart started racing , prompting her to go to the emergency room after a quick assessment , the intake doctor declared that she had bipolar disorder , committed her to a psychiatric ward and started her on dangerous psychiatric medication from my conversations with this woman , i d say she was responding to severe exhaustion and alarm , not suffering from mental illness caplan goes on to express her concerns with psychiatric diagnoses , the dsm , the problems with these labels that lead to the use of dangerous medications oh , we 've been here on shrink rap before , see diagnostic labels that change lives caplan continues in our increasingly psychiatrized world , the first course is often to classify anything but routine happiness as a mental disorder , assume it is based on a broken brain or a chemical imbalance , and prescribe drugs or hospitalization even electroshock is still performed according to the psychiatrists bible , the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm , which defines the criteria for doling out psychiatric labels , a patient can fall into a bipolar category after having just one manic episode lasting a week or less given what this patient was dealing with , it is not surprising that she was talking quickly , had racing thoughts , was easily distracted and was intensely focused on certain goals i e caring for her family thus meeting the requisite four of the eight criteria for a bipolar diagnosis when a social worker in the psychiatric ward advised the patient to go on permanent disability , concluding that her bipolar disorder would make it too hard to work , the patient did as the expert suggested she also took a neuroleptic drug , seroquel , that the doctor said would fix her mental illness caplan goes on to say that because of the existence of a psychiatric label one she contends is wrong the patient lost her friends , her marriage , her home , her self confidence , her wealth , was forced to move across the country to somewhere she was isolated , and the six weeks she spent on medication presumably seroquel left her with a condition that may someday leave her blind mental health professionals should use , and patients should insist on , what does work not snap judgment diagnoses , but instead listening to patients respectfully to understand their suffering and help them find more natural ways of healing exercise , good nutrition , meditation and human connection are often more effective and less risky than drugs or electroshock caplan , a harvard psychologist , goes on to discuss a complaint she is helping to file against the dsm editors on behalf of patients who were misdiagnosed psychiatric diagnoses , she concludes , are not scientific and they put people at risk where do i even begin ? please , please , i do n't know the patient , i only know the presentation given , and i'm going to be very sarcastic , because the way it was presented struck me a ridiculous and it distracted from some valid points that might have been made if there was n't the evil , idiot psychiatrist theme with a sensationalist tone shame on the washington post for printing this okay , so i could n't quite follow the case she presented , at first it sounds like the patient went to the er with symptoms of a cardiac problem , or exhaustion , or a maybe a panic attack perhaps , but some imbecile er doc did a check list of symptoms , told her she had bipolar disorder , and without even listening to her , weighing other options , or taking into consideration the context of her life , sent her off with seroquel and a recommendation for therapy this misdiagnosis then destroyed her life , because why would her husband and friends stick with her if she 's got bipolar disorder ? what better time to leave your wife then when her grandmother is dying , she 's stressed out and sick ? so she went to the er because she was tired and her heart was racing i think they see this all the time i think they do an ekg and perhaps make sure the patient is n't having a heart attack or arrhythmia , and if they think it 's anxiety , the patient gets a dose of a benzodiazepine , and gets sent home okay , but it 's an er and the docs are rushed and focused on what the patient needs now they make wrong diagnoses all the time , and it 's not just psychiatry , and it 's not just because the doctor is sitting there with the dsm or has memorized the hundreds of possible diagnostic criteria okay , but it turns out that she was on a psychiatric ward you ca n't get admitted to a psychiatric ward because you 're tired , with racing thoughts , a fast heartbeat , talking fast and being distracted pretty much , you need to be a danger , suicidal , or having severe hallucinations or delusions , or be in extreme distress in some way this was a wealthy patient who could afford outpatient care all i'm sure of , is there is something more to the story finally , the patient was admitted to a psychiatry unit , so presumably there was a second doctor who met with the patient and a treatment team that observed her behavior for a few days okay , i 've stories of really lousy inpatient care , and i do believe the diagnosis could still be wrong and the treatment that was recommended might be wrong , or helpful at the moment but not necessary for the long term , but i do n't buy that a misdiagnosis let to the complete demise of this patient 's life and a need to move across the country these are the types of problems one sees as a result of the behaviors a person might have because they have a mental illness , perhaps one such as bipolar disorder so i do n't know the patient , or the diagnosis but i do know that the entire premise for this article is based on the idea that the patient was simply tired and stressed and perfectly normal and did not have a psychiatric disorder the author tells us this and this label alone destroyed her life the reader is not allowed to even entertain the idea that the patient had a psychiatric disorder that maybe the psychiatrist did get some history and make reasonable observations , and the patient really did have bipolar disorder ? obviously , i do n't know this there 's no mention of a review of the records , discussion with family , interview of the doctor , caplan is telling us her impression based on the patient 's report only maybe the patient had panic disorder , or a personality disorder , or even an adjustment disorder perfectly possible given the stresses involved oh , but then she took a bum recommendation to go on disability , and she got it ! i 've seen really sick people not get disability it takes a lot of documentation and the government looks for ways to avoid paying this you do n't get disability for having a psychiatric diagnosis , you have to be disabled by it so , somehow , this patient who was simply exhausted and stressed , with no psychiatric disorder , per dr caplan , managed to get admitted to a hospital and get disability benefits there were some valid points caplan could have made the dsm is not a 'scientific manual ' personally , i do n't find it terribly helpful in clinical practice i do n't keep a copy in my office i bought one to use while writing shrink rap , and i'm not planning to buy the dsm v the overall concept is good , and it 's very helpful to researchers to be certain that the groups they study have some diagnostic reliability , otherwise there is no way if knowing if a certain treatment addresses a specific group of people who can reliably be classified as having a specific illness this is n't all bad , but i do n't need diagnosis for my work predicted in the new dsm v and caplan makes the statement that the editor , allen frances , says the work is based in science but has spread it 's net too far if you read dr frances' blog , you 'll note that he is quite skeptical and opposed to many of the proposed changes for dsm v it 's not like the psychiatrists are n't thinking hard about these diagnostic categories and the ramifications they have still , i'm skeptical about how we think about these disorders , especially bipolar disorder i agree with caplan that psychiatrists should listen more fifteen minute med checks have made a mockery of our profession i also tell all of my patients to exercise , eat healthy , and look for ways to solve their problems but to imply that these things are the answers for the majority of people who are suffering and often too distressed , depressed , and unmotivated , to just pull up their bootstraps , get up and exercise and cook a healthy meal is an insult you know , sometimes those things really do work , but if people are able to do those things , they 've often tried them before seeking psychiatric opinions to read caplan 's piece , you 'd think everyone is an idiot and finally , ect it still in use because some people find it helps okay , i am ranted out
