if i were to return to writing poetry , no doubt over a matter of years one good poem might be yanked from my heart to join what pieces remain , but that realization is a long time away while on the subject of death , i thought i 'd just post some poems on the subject whether they are helpful or not , i ca n't know i do n't know much of anything now except allowing myself to cry when i need to and doing the daily things wash , dishes , pay the bills , garden most of all i just hang with sarah , my yr old , who is the greatest comfort a father could wish for in enduring the loss of a another daughter , although buying her return tickets made me cry i do n't want her to leave , as in never of course , impractical i have been teaching her to drive and she now has her driver 's permit tomorrow she has to learn to change a tire today we went over required fluids here are the poems , i wo n't bother to say where or when they were published the dead are we gentler with the dead than with the living ? we lower them like glassware into the earth and speak well of them , careful of their feelings we adorn their tombs with photos and tulips their rest is so sacred we need a court order to disturb it it is easy to love the dead they make no demands they are not in competition they ca n't be more dead a time to kill it was given us by a farmer , found in a field i cupped it in my hands like snow suddenly it sprang to the hardwood floor captured again , i held it close a splotch of blood stained my shirt i checked my cuticles then noticed a toothpick of a bone jutting from the ripped fur and the large hind foot the lucky one hanging limp as a broken flower death the cricket 's hibernation and the dream of the seventeen year locust are pure , like the silence of god during prayer i see death as an old coot in a rocking chair spitting tobacco while bullets fly , knowing how westerns end we are eternal or eternal myth no one believes in their own death mom 's passing i two months ago she did the sunday crossword with a pen now she cannot tease the rubber band from my gift of roses distantly she smiles she is in no pain she knows her diagnosis as you might a brand of toothpaste , a detail too irrelevant to ponder at dinner tonight she ate her salad with a spoon she was not embarrassed for the first time i see her face without worry it is not her face i might have noticed sooner if she called at times other than cocktail hour when i expected her speech to slur it was n't until she wrapped the potatoes in newspaper for baking that we suspected after a brain scan and biopsy the doctors said radiation might extend her life by temporarily shrinking the tumor but it would n't restore her mind , so we passed she always said she did n't want to linger we chose to care for her at home my youngest brother took the last watch i remember him lumbering down the spanish stairs to say , she 's passed none of us cried how could we mourn a mute and waxen body in blue diapers as if it were our mother ? death is so impersonal ii three legal miles from landfall i felt her ashes between my palms , silky as talcum powder and odorless i sprinkled them on the sea where they sunk underwater like snow in a snow globe funeral flowers followed leopard lilies , white carnations , scarlet roses , birds of paradise and her beloved pink antheriums , strange flowers without scent from her bedside , outlasting her we circled twice and headed home i watched the flowers rock in our widening wake like the paper boats she taught me how to make she folded them so perfectly she could fold a fitted sheet so you could n't tell it from a flat one i ca n't rate myself craig erick
