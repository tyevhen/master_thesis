a confusion of princes , by garth nix read by michael goldstrom yo khemri has just become a prince of an intergalactic empire but being a prince is n't at all what he expected there 's no cruising around the empire in his shiny new ship , having adventures and making his fortune no , the emperor will be retiring soon , and khemri must prepare to compete for the status of new emperor i got this book because i loved the other garth nix books i 've read , and i wanted a book my nephew would enjoy for a road trip i was a little disappointed in this book first of all , it was n't really age appropriate for my nephew , who 's i think it would be more appropriate for a or year old second , it was a bit boring the plot had great potential , but it just fell flat for me i enjoyed the world building , and thought so much more could have been done with it he was limiting himself with the age range , i think if he tried the same universe with a target audience of older teens to adults , then it would have been a splendid book
