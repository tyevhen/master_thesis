my good friend and once med school roommate had a letter published in today 's new york times quoted in full re a stubborn case of spending on cancer care business day , june despite recognition of the problem , the fact remains that our current system of health care reimbursement values procedures and volume over time spent with patients the time spent talking with patients and families is an investment that pays for itself many times over carefully eliciting a history , reviewing records and communicating with other health providers , assessing patients values and weighing them into decisions regarding complex treatment options cannot be done in minutes , but it can provide better and more humane outcomes technologically advanced and costly treatments save lives , but their allocation needs to be made sensibly and not to the detriment of old fashioned talking and listening between doctor and patient patients want and deserve this time intensive care , and although it can often be ultimately cost saving , it will not be the norm until the financial incentives reverse themselves susan c kalish , m d boston , june , i have a nice friend , she is a warm and caring doctor with an enormous heart and wonderful values , even if she is n't a psychiatrist she 's a geriatrician sometimes i'm not sure exactly what medicine is about we allocate our resources in idiosyncratic ways , some of which do n't make sense in terms of cost benefit but do in terms of emotion we 've come to see physicians as precious resources , whose time needs to be meted out in cost effective minute doses while the humanity of medicine is doled out to less expensive professionals nurses , physician assistants , social worker therapists susan says , and i 'll agree , it 's a mistake
