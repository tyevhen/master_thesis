an old friend asked me to post my tips for enduring depression i developed these for the depressive and manic depressive association , where they were published in various newsletters here goes accept your depression do not fight it do not think of yourself as a failure but as sick you are in the grip of a serious illness you can only do what you can if that means lying in bed all day , that 's fine just because you do n't have an amputated limb to show the world does not make you any less sick it 's better to do something than nothing for instance , it 's better to go for a walk than sit , paralyzed , thinking about going for a walk it 's better to take a nap than blame yourself for being tired it 's better to go downstairs than stay upstairs all day long it 's better to do something active than something passive it 's better to wash the dishes than watch tv it 's better to drive than sit in your car if you can stomach it , it 's better to go to work than stay home on sick leave if you have to stay home , however , that 's ok this is a debilitating illness it 's better to be with or around people than to be alone i have found just sitting in a mall surrounded by the motion of strangers more comforting than staying home try to set a small , achievable goal each day mine is , i'm going to try not to hate myself too much today make sure the goal is attainable for a depressed person do n't saddle yourself with cleaning out the entire garage that will just bury you under a sense of hopelessness and failure but you could consider sweeping out one corner of the garage note that these principles are meant for enduring depression , not necessarily improving it the best treatment for depression , short of ect , is medication and cognitive behavioral therapy right now kathleen makes up a list for me when she goes to work simple things like wiping the refrigerator shelves doing the tasks enumerated does n't necessarily make me feel better , but i do feel slightly more useful in the worst depths of depression , i'm always amazed i can do anything for instance , when washing dishes , it seems like each dish i wash is a miracle i ca n't believe i did it ! and the same reaction obtains with every dish for those who fear ect but may need it , the memory loss from ect , in my experience , is much less than the memory loss induced by a soul destroying depression i hope these tips may prove useful to the afflicted thine in mood and madness , ce
