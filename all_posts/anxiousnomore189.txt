photo by bruno d rodrigues today i found out that in a few weeks i am going to have to travel to north california for business i will be doing this trip alone that scares me to death i am trying to look at it as an adventure but i know i will be a nervous reck about it i will have to rent a car and drive which that alone is enough stress and anxiety , but add driving to unknown places in unfamiliar towns and cities and thats really scary for me i have never done something like this before at least all by myself i am going to have to plan as much beforehand as i can with maps and mace just thinking about it is making feel like i ca n't breathe i am having to take giant heaping breaths even as i type this ok i just took a quick walk away from my desk and was thinking about it and i am trying to focus on the excitement aspect , not the fear i will be able to take pics of the golden gate bridge and prove to myself that i am a capable of doing this on my own it will be a challenge , but it will also be a huge learning experience for me any tips out there for me ? i also have a dinner with some old coworkers tonight that i am trying to not get freaked out about deep breaths one step at a time if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety or add it to your technorati favorites you might also like celebrate ! traveling with anxiety trip traveling with anxiety trip miami travel followup anticaptory anxiety coming right up ! linkwithin
