the story below has been around for at least ten years i liked it because of it 's simplicity of message in the original version , this next sentence follows the story since this is my blog , i believe it should proceed it too often we underestimate the power of a touch , a smile , a kind word , a listening ear , an honest compliment , or the smallest act of caring , all of which have the potential to turn a life around when i was young and full of p and vinegar , so many things went by unnoticed , or noticed and then forgotten at some point in my life , i started to appreciate these little moments and , fortunately for me , memories of many of those moments from my childhood and early adult years poured in with the progression of kennedy 's disease , the opportunity to notice these moments has increased substantially whether from a caregiver , a friend , or a stranger you pass on the street , the power of a smile , a hug , a kind word , etc can change your world even though you might have read this story before , i ask that you take a moment and read it again it always brings a smile to my face and a warmth in my heart enjoy lunch with god a little boy wanted to meet god he knew it might be a long trip to where god lived , so he packed his backpack with a bag of potato chips and a six pack of root beer when he had gone about three blocks , he saw an old woman she was sitting in the park , just staring at some pigeons the boy sat down next to her and opened his backpack he was about to take a drink from his root beer when he noticed that the old lady looked hungry , so he offered her some chips she gratefully accepted them and smiled at him her smile was so pretty that the boy wanted to see it again , so he offered her a root beer again , she smiled at him the boy was delighted they sat there all afternoon eating and smiling , but they never said a word as twilight approached , the boy realized it was time to go home he got up to leave but before he had gone more than a few steps , he turned around , ran back to the old woman , and gave her a hug she gave him her biggest smile yet when the boy arrived home , his mother was surprised by the smile on her son 's face she asked him , what did you do today ? he replied , i had lunch with god you know what ? she 's got the most beautiful smile i 've ever seen meanwhile , the old woman returned to her home her son was stunned by the look of peace on her face he asked , mother , what did you do today ? she replied , i ate potato chips in the park with god you know , he 's much younger than i expected photo jpg by wunee
