here 's the next in sine wave , after at the carnival on the eve of the mexican day of the dead i did a line of coke this morning and felt strange , like a glass puppet moving through glass light stung shadows were razor sharp dark children s laughter separated into strands as they exited school in blue uniforms carrying orange marigolds home to their dead later i wrote elegant critiques , my brain on automatic like a computerized monorail i did n't have to think while i was thinking , my fingers typed with their own intelligence , my commentaries were crystalline is this what death feels like ? moving without thought like a glass puppet through glass ? back home in a frozen panic of calm i begged my wife to make love though i entered her deeply i could not incarnate myself i was clear yet clearly disconnected is this what death feels like ? well , is it ? is it ? published in plum ruby review this poem contains one of my all time favorite metaphors a glass puppet moving through glass the whole poem was based on that phrase , along with a boost from yeats' the long legged fly here the imagined speaker experiences a negative epiphany , though perhaps the poem is unfair to use drugs as a prop for his altered state clinically bipolars are much more likely to abuse alcohol and drugs when they are hypomanic or manic when you are invulnerable nothing can harm you in my deepest depressions i 've quit smoking and quit drinking without trying , as they were too much effort for no payoff when the brain changes gears , so does its appetite for exogenous entertainment by means of chemicals in when i was manic not even a six pack of ale could slow me the manic brain is very resistant to drugs , as the brain is manufacturing much more powerful drugs than can be had on the street some studies aver that one 's lithium level drops in mania even while maintaining the same dosage yesterday 's post gives me an idea why not write words on every poet i 've read enough of to have an opinion on what i 've read ? thumbnail critiques if my mood holds , it 's exactly the sort of thing i 'd like to do and mia of tryst might have a use for them i noticed kristy bowen and michii are both in the issue congrats ! next how about keats ? holding at kilorats , thine , ce
