lessons in life are often repeated , and we may not get it the first time around a high school reunion is coming up , and i 've had the opportunity to chat with some old friends not in touch for years and despite those decades they are still the same , still terrific people when i find such friends i do try to keep in touch nowadays , as it is so easy to link a facebook account but of course there is no substitute for seeing someone live and in person biologically speaking we use all our senses when meeting up with someone , note chemokines , subtle changes in expression , a lively or reserved manner , the sparkle in one 's eye or the threat , as it is likely murder was a big contribution to mortality in the past these non verbal signals are why in clinical psychiatry practice even a video therapy session will never quite replace the in person visit schubert impromptu no right click to open in new tab at paleofx i had the great pleasure of meeting several fellow paleo mds after the final panel i went with two of them we shall call them catfish and hollywood to bbq and the wild austin scene of sxsw on a friday night when one meets another paleo blogger intensely interested in the science , as at ahs and paleofx , it is rather like crawling out of the desert into an oasis of likemindedness meeting other paleo doctors is like crawling out and finding the taj mahal i hate to get all poor me , i'm a physician , but the current suffocating paradigm of american medicine can be so deflating in psychiatry we are squeezed into this impossible space between the fda , medicare , the scientific literature or evidence base , common sense , expectations , history , and ethics sometimes there are no right answers , and clinical practice becomes the square root of a negative number so to meet other doctors who look at the evolutionary paradigm , and have succeeded in their personal lives implementing it and are thinking about implementing it for their patients is exhilarating they understand the legal and cultural ramifications of such a change in a very real sense , we are a brotherhood , and they are my kin such meetings can be intense , but fulfiling we walked together past the texas state capital at midnight , knowing we would meet the next day for an after conference training session at a local crossfit appropriately enough the training session was an opt presentation by james fitzgerald apparently he has the honor of being kicked out of crossfit just like robb wolf and to me this situation ghost like at paleofx as the last time robb and james were in austin was for the infamous black box summit where they were summarily dismissed from the official crossfit fold is absolutely remarkable have you ever met robb wolf ? he is an incredible presence intense , organized , smart , driven , good looking , and by all accounts devoted and kind any reasonable business would love to have him as the poster boy of the good example james fitzgerald was a similarly impressive specimen it is hard to define him without using swear words as he ended about every third sentence with one or another , but it is clear from his presentation that he thinks in directions at once , he cares intensely about athletes and training , and he has the wisdom to break it down and know what is going wrong to you can set it right though much of the presentation went over my head as a non trainer , i was captivated by james' ideas and break down of the essential problems facing an athlete in an intense moment is it blood flow , psychologic barriers , lungs , training , diet whatever it is ask the athlete his or her experience after the wod and he or she will tell you james has been in the research game from the beginning , and he noted with excitment that we could throw out the numbers from endurance athletes and straight up weight training , as the differences with crossfit style training showed whole new numbers , and whole new possibilities of human capability how could crossfit hq dismiss james and robb for the crimes of suggesting paleo nutrition , the idea of on ramp beginners training rather than ubiquitous scaling and gasp periodization ? the answer is in my wheelhouse personality james and robb with their brilliance and drive were a threat to the powers that be at that moment hq were more comfortable jettisoning the bright stars than accepting new ideas as wildly off base as such a business decision could be , it makes sense in light of an understanding of a personality in charge confronted with the young challengers in the paleosphere we have the same challenge there are flamboyant and brittle personalities who insist they are correct , and new information coming online all the time what does the newbie hold onto ? with opposing and strongly argued viewpoints , what do we believe ? forget the paleo myths forget the personalities are you eating for the most part real food excepting autoimmune disease are you exercising ? how is your sleep ? what are you feeling ? what are the pitfalls ? what is your family doing ? fix those issues and answer those questions first know where you are , and then look for more guidance we are working on a network of doctors who might help i hope cults of personality wo n't get in the way , but do n't let it confuse you what makes sense , from every angle ? never suspend disbelief so named because a woman at a restaurant mistook him for a hollywood star and while he was certianly ruggedly handsome and in good shape , i felt the incident serrved as an example of how a good lifestyle and exercise regimen could beautify someone to more mythical status
