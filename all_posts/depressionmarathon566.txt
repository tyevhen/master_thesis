i'm feeling very lucky and grateful why ? i 've been able to run twice in the past days i do n't understand why it makes no sense , but i 've been able to run that little loose body keeps floating around in my knee joint , occasionally getting lodged and causing significant pain , but it 's also allowed me some painfree time as well sunday afternoon was one of those painfree times i woke up with pain sunday morning , but it soon worked it 's way out i went to church , had breakfast with friends , complained about not being able to run , and came home disgusted that i was facing another swimming workout in a moment of belligerence , i donned my running gear to take puck for a walk of course , we did n't start out walking i figured my knee would grab me soon enough , so puck and i began running our usual mile loop unbelievably , my knee did n't hurt , and puck and i ran the entire loop after finishing puck 's loop , i dropped him at home and decided to see how far i could go my plan was to continue running loops so i would n't get too far from home well , that plan went out the window after another painfree mile instead of coming home i continued running further and further away by the time i turned back toward home , i was in the midst of a mile run ! i ran miles ! i could n't believe it that was sunday i 've had knee pain off and on since then that loose body is still in there but today i went out to test it again my legs were still tired from sunday 's effort , and my knee was a little tricky , but i made it miles without pain i think someone was smiling down on me i cannot begin to tell you how cautiously relieved i am one minute i was distraught and certain i was going to miss the boston marathon in the next moment everything looked quite different at this point , i'm thinking i may be able to run walk it , but i am cautiously optimistic i do n't know what tomorrow will hold i'm planning to run a mile long run this week we 'll see how that goes before i get too excited like i said , i'm feeling lucky and grateful my mood was taking a precipitous drop prior to my miler on sunday i was getting quite worried being able to run has helped put a halt to the drop that 's a relief i do n't think i could handle another depression relapse right now but we 'll see what happens i'm preparing for the worst , but hopefully i 'll be able to continue to run
