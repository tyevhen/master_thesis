the official kilobunny , courtesy of jennifer i do n't want to jinx myself by prematurely pronouncing myself improved , but to hell with superstition on saturday , july , i did not cry i have not wept since i have experienced hope i have experienced pleasure at kathleen 's suggestion , with the small checks i recently earned for my poems , i treated myself today to an outlandish shirt , part of the wrangler silver series a western shirt with faux pearl snaps , black with maroon and truly silver pinstripes shimmering silver from some special thread a shirt fit for a manic i shall wear it when performing my next gig is at art in the gardens in the botanical gardens of fort bragg , august any locals should be sure to come as it is a grand party just before midnight on july , an old friend and bass playing band mate of mind called to say , i love you , monkey we have a long history of monkey speak he 's even crazier than i am so we talked monkey crazy for a while and i explained to him my ongoing plight the next morning his brother , an old guitar playing band mate of mine , called as well and was in good spirits i had n't heard from either in a long time coincidental conversations ? or was the universe winking at me ? the period of time for which i 've been taking a full dose of the new medications i suggested to my psychiatrist is now about two weeks , exactly the amount of time one would expect before a response am i finally coming out of the woods when i was neck deep in bear shit ? after fucking fucking fucking months , am i going to make it this time and finally feel like thomas the tank , a useful engine ? as captain picard says , make it so please make it so i will of course let you know if my euthymia holds do you know how long it 's been since i had a feeling of hope ? a feeling that i am not entirely worthless and that my life may not have been entirely wasted ? to not fear every phone call , to not perceive every detail of existence as an inscrutable , sisiphyean boulder to push ? btw , the zyprexa , like the seroquel , made me no better , perhaps worse all it did was ratchet up my melancholic seizures to later , because i slept later so instead of falling apart into hopeless tears at first at am each day , i would instead begin disintegrating at pm it fooled me early on the first day after a dose before i realized the new pattern sneaky , sneaky chemicals cross your fingers and pray , chant , or meditate for me , send flaming arrows of good karma my way if my mood holds you 'll be treated to a different kind of subject matter , though naturally my readership will decline , since nothing sells like misery i do n't mean this as a criticism but a simple acknowledgment of human nature thank you all for sticking with me kilobunny ! craig erick
