there is so much discussion of the notion of self esteem that i think it warrants more discussion we need to find out what it is , actually so first of all , is there such a thing ? no why not ? because it is not a feeling it is an idea , one that friends or therapists can use to bolster it or diminish it so what is it ? it is a sense that i am accepted , loved , approved of , wanted , desired , and believed important normal , loved individuals never think about it they just have it and act accordingly those who need to think about don t have it and so when others tell you what you need to hear , you are important , valued and approved of , it temporarily lifts the esteem a bit this is an artificial lift it dampens the real feelings , feelings that were installed from womb life onward so why do we feel we have low esteem , something that needs to be bolstered ? when we are born we begin to follow orders parents tell us what to eat and when to eat where to sit and not fidgit or move around when to go out and when not to we are not told , what would you like for dinner ? what time do you want to eat ? ad infinitum bit by bit it sinks in i am not important and no one cares what i think or feel especially at the dinner table where the important people talk and we listen no one elicits our opinion about the color of the walls , the kind of chairs we sit on and when we are allowed to have guests in this is how esteem is created , not necessarily by a parent saying you are important , but rather by being treated from infancy onward as someone who is important parents who value you are governed by their feelings parents who do not value you also are governed by their feelings , which quickly become the soundtrack of your life this can all be compounded by parents who do tell you that you are stupid and incapable or they keep you from handling important tools or they don t take the time to explain things what does that do ? it means that you are not important enough to be worth anyone s time an impatient parent who is tense and anxious makes you feel unimportant you have to speak right away and wait for the answer , which may not come you have the feeling that you cannot take up too much of their valuable time it creates the subtext , i am not important right after birth when the newborn is left alone and not hugged and cuddled right away , the groundwork for low self esteem is created if thereafter you have to struggle to get them to pay attention , you are building feelings of inferiority it is those wee events throughout our early lives that construct permanent feelings of being unimportant if parents wait for you to hug them , instead of them rushing to embrace you , another neurotic block is there to reinforce your low esteem it is not a thought out process when parents are aloof and heavily repressed as individuals , and cannot respond to the child with feelings , with alacrity and passion , there will be another compounded feeling in a child who now feels worthless and not worth anyone s time or anyone s love worth less alright , we now go to get our esteem lifted can we do that ? no our therapist thinks we are wonderful and praises us that will last for a short time but the real feeling rushes back in and that feeling is the result of a myriad of events , all of which spell i am not important i am unloved those feelings set in during the critical period which probably occurs before the age of six anything after that is symbolic fulfillment and won t last but we can become addicted and need praise more and more because it is symbolic fulfillment , long past its due date when we are complimented and someone who feels unimportant can be bought for a single compliment , it eases the pain momentarily it operates like a tranquilizer softens the blow you are such a good person you are so important to me the reason the real feeling is never thought out is because it is a feeling that is the result of thousands of very early experiences those experiences coalesce around very few feelings , but those feelings drive so many symbolic act outs the very fact that a child in crib can cry out for his mother for a very long time instills that sense of being unimportant remember , esteem is a word you do not necessarily feel esteemed you feel loved and that does it all once you feel loved you no longer search for that elusive esteem those who go on searching will never find it it is too late and it is not one thing you are looking for esteem you are really looking for someone to help instill a feeling inside you that he cannot do someone who can undo what happened to you no therapist can lift your esteem level only you can do it by feeling those key experiences where little by little you came to feel unloved and unworthy of it until then you need praise and more praise cause the real feeling is seeping through conversely , a single criticism can devastate someone who feels unimportant why ? because it triggers off the real pain i am unworthy and you they just proved it if there is one thing that most of us cannot tolerate it is criticism , even slight criticism we spend our lives staving them off so we won t have to face and feel those feelings and those who feel bad about themselves do whatever they can to avoid criticism when it does occur the person can manage to immediately rationalize her behavior or displace it onto someone else i would have done better if you had not done it can never be their fault because behind that accusation is a mountain of pain
