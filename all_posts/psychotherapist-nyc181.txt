the expression taking time apart is often used by one or both people in a relationship when what they really mean is let 's breakup in my prior articles , i 've addressed the issue of being honest in relationships see my articles relationships and lies of omission , relationships out act instead of acting in your relationship , and betrayal in relationships becoming aware that you ca n't trust your spouse in this article , i'm addressing an important issue that often leaves people feeling betrayed because of the lack of honesty involved being honest in your relationship are you taking time apart or breaking up ? i hope to encourage people in a relationship that really know it 's over to be honest rather than giving your spouse or partner false hope in order to avoid the unpleasantness of a breakup of course , there are times when one or both people are n't sure if they want to stay together or not and taking time apart is a way for each of them to discover how they really feel about the relationship as long as both people are as honest as they can be with themselves and with each other , i do n't see a problem with this see my article your relationship should you stay or should you go ? what i'm referring to is a situation where , usually , one person really wants to leave the relationship and the other wants to try to salvage it the one who wants to leave knows it 's over , but s he wants to avoid the messiness of a breakup by calling it time apart rather than being honest that s he knows they 're not getting back together once they 've parted this leads to false hope for the one who wants to stay and overall misunderstandings i 've seen this dynamic many times in couples therapy where a couple comes to talk about relationship issues and , sometimes in the first session , the one who originally said they wanted to take a break reveals that s he wants it to be over and then says that the other individual in the relationship should use the therapy session for him or herself in those instances , the one who wants out knew all along that , even though s he agreed to couples sessions , s he planned to leave the partner off in my office so that i could be the one to deal with the partner 's heartbreak over the breakup in those circumstances , the person who wanted to salvage the relationship is not only heartbroken but also feels betrayed because it quickly becomes apparent that this was the intention all along of coming to the therapy session to avoid taking responsibility for ending the relationship and the emotional aftermath that goes with that not only is this unfair to the partner who wants to remain , it 's also unfair the person who wanted to end it even when someone knows that it 's over , s he usually has feelings about it there might be feelings of relief , but there is usually sadness too because most relationships , even ones that are ending , had good aspects to them at some point there was love at one point and other positive emotions it 's not like throwing away yesterday 's newspaper there is a responsibility , in most circumstances , to a spouse or partner to be your best self when you 're breaking up and this involves honesty , kindness and a willingness to help him or her to understand what 's happening in the relationship i say in most circumstances because there are times when it 's too dangerous to stay in a relationship if a spouse or partner is being abusive , the person who is leaving may have to seek safety for him or herself and the children then , once everyone is safe , s he can use the social service system to negotiate the problems let 's take a look at a fictionalized vignette , which is based on many different cases , to understand this phenomenon mary and dan mary and dan had been living together for years during the last year , they had been arguing a lot about money , whether or not to have children , and whether to stay in nyc or to move being honest in your relationship are you taking time apart or breaking up ?
