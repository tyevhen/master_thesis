i 've been involved recently in an experiment , an experiment that i 've created myself with the basis of positivity how many times have you heard people saying just cheer up or think positively and it will all be fine ? i know full well that this is n't possible for everyone and at every stage of life , especially in the case of depression trust me , it angers me more than anything when people tell me just to be happy when i am depressed however , positivity definitely makes a big impact on your life if you can enforce it when it came to the revision of my a level exams , i had felt very defeatist and like i was fighting a losing battle however , i know that if i gave up , i would never have a chance at getting success second of all and perhaps the biggest change to my mindset , was that instead of staying down and in pity when an essay did n't go well , or a grade went down , i would have my moment and then begin again do n't get me wrong , it is extremely hard to find the strength in yourself to get back up , even when you feel nothing is going your way however , it 's possible and you can do it for a while now i have been trying out this positive mindset and it has helped tremendously it takes a lot of work and training , but it should have a beneficial impact another way in which i have tried to train my brain is through writing speeches which i can read to myself every morning it 's proven that by feeding yourself with positive thoughts your doubts will fail to exist there is a big difference between battling depression and thinking positively and it 's important to make this distinction because , telling someone who is battling depression to think positively , will just make things worse amy xx
