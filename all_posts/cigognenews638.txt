look at this review in the sunday n y times oct for millions of children with anxiety disorders , jerome kagan s groundbreaking research has relieved a burden of blame by identifying highly reactive responses as hard wired and thus nobody s fault the other burden that can be relieved is anxiety itself the most common mental disorder but , luckily , the most treatable with empirically proven cognitive behavior therapy , children can learn to reinterpret their overprotective brains and their unreliable first reaction data and , in doing so , outsmart the worry and not let their amygdalas ruin their days although robin marantz henig s excellent article ended on a note of resignation , given the proper tools even the most anxious children in this age of neuroplasticity can override their neural presets and make a world of difference in their lives this is a professional s view of kagan s work if i interpret this right it is our job as therapists to ease the guilt of patients since most anxieties are hard wired according to this , it is no one s fault and they say , very treatable i think it is just the opposite anxiety is the most difficult to treat because it starts its life almost when we do , at the very beginning with a newly developing nervous system that organizes the midline responses generated by the lower brain such as respiration , digestion , heart rate blood pressure , body temperature , stress hormones , and so on it is our most primitive system that alerts us to the presence of danger it is basic to survival anything that profound is not trivial and certainly not so easily suppressed remember , this is a basic survival strategy not some esoteric bizarre reaction that comes out of nowhere kagan is a well known name in our field , which is why i shall spend time on his ideas what happens is that very early trauma , in the womb or at birth causes great pain because of the danger , for example of lack of oxygen , and it is immediately repressed in the interest of survival constant pain and life threatening reactions to it are a menace to the system so what happens when early on the pain is compounded by infancy , childhood neglect and lack of love there is an increasingly compacted agony so that alarm reactions more cortisol secreted , are set in place those primitive reactions continue their life extracted from their painful roots thus , seemingly out of the blue a mystery ? not if we access to the deep unconscious where we can observe raw terror as it is taking place and we now see the context of it all , which in the reliving , is resolving we don t have to guess any more we see a situation where the patient is in full terror mode with no words or scenes to put to it afterwards , the patient will know exactly where the terror , now called anxiety , comes from absent this one must guess in science we call it something else , hypothesis but it is still a guess what if we did not have to guess ? isn t that preferable we guess because we don t think we can access the deep unconscious , and we are not even sure it is there i have not seen this level of consciousness unconsciousness discussed it is not in the lingua franca of the scientists in our field but it is not just observation that counts we have done blind studies of our patients and found that cortisol levels stress hormones , part of alarm system , high when entering therapy , normalize after one year of treatment the only variable to account for this is primal therapy it is interesting that , by the by , they agree that there are neural pre sets , that certain biologic functions are in place they think they are genetic , that is , hard wired and the general effort , they believe , is to over ride the genetic tendencies , to hold them back , suppress , and get on with life there is not much discussion of epigenetics what happens to those genetic tendencies as a result of trauma in the womb and at birth if scientists don t pay attention to the latest in neuro biologic research they are going to neglect an awful lot it looks like science , the fancy laboratories , men in white coats , all the accoutrements of science but it lies within certain boundaries that bind the investigators that the deepest levels of the brain are inaccessible , that they are fixed and unchangeable that these basic hard wired tendencies are not changeable and are genetic there is no question as to why they are in place and their basic biologic function they take it all as a given and go on from there kagan sees in children a way to outsmart their pain and fear and keep the amygdala from ruining their day this is basic cognitive therapy given the patina of research , but the guess hypothesis already has a frame of reference lodged in cognitive therapy that we can think our way to health , that we can overcome our biologic reactions , that thoughts , beliefs and ideas can hold down all difficult feelings this is forgetting that feelings and sensations are survival modes and are not meant to be suppressed i suppose for intellectuals , locked into their heads , it is a solution but a costly one just because we can suppress anxiety doesn t mean it is n't doing great damage on lower brain levels and their bodily counterparts eventually strokes and cardiac attacks are the result the brain wasn t meant to suppress its survival mode except to keep the thinking brain functioning hiding the truth , which is their basic proclivity , is not a healthy option since intellectuals do that as a matter of course , they think it valuable for all of us this is a neurotic strategy raised to the level of a scientific principle jerome kagan , yale child study center
