brandweeknrx has a very interesting story about the government attempting to push glaxosmithkline 's nicorette rather than going cold turkey to stop smoking according to some evidence , it appears that there is actually little data to support such an idea meaning that cold turkey is no less effective than nicorette i am not directly familiar with the evidence on this point , but if true , that 's sure interesting but there 's another layer to the story the folks writing the government guidelines for how to best quit smoking well , some of them are on gsk 's payroll how convenient
