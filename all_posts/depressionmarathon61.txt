it never fails to amaze me i'm not unique you 'd think i would have learned that by now i mean i 've been writing this blog since apparently i'm slow nevertheless , after reading your comments in the days following my last post i again discovered i am not unique i really was surprised i thought my feeling of detachment was novel , but it turned out it was only novel for me many of you had felt it , too thanks for sharing your comments and letting me know over the last years , that 's been one of the main benefits of authoring this blog , re discovering i'm not unique depression is such an isolating illness it pulls me inside out i disappear into a shell of myself when overwhelmed with its debilitating effects i feel totally alone , and isolation definitely nurtures that feeling of uniqueness fortunately for me , and unfortunately for others with this damn illness , my experiences are not so different from your experiences you get it you can relate having others understand and relate to what i'm feeling and describing is quite comforting even though it constantly surprises me , it 's always a good surprise thank you i'm so fortunate to have this space where i can be surprised when feeling dark and alone your comments comforted and carried me many times over these last few months thank you for taking the time to share your experiences with me sometimes it 's good not to be unique
