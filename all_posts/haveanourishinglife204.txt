photo published on web here skipping a meal is a slippery slope stepping on a scale is also a slippery slope in addition , eating too much healthy food , exercising for more than an hour , looking in the mirror too often , going clothes shopping , putting on a swimsuit , and looking at women s magazines are all dangerously icy inclines these things are risky business because i could easily slip into the old eating disorder habits okay , sometimes , i am going along doing every right and it just happens i am stuck outside , miles from home , and i find myself in some bad weather do i brave the circumstances to get safely back home ? mental disorders are kind of like ohio weather one day it s degrees and sunny the next day , it is snowy with wind chill temperatures in the single digits i cannot control the weather i cannot control mental disorders the weather comes and goes , just like feelings come and go even though it may feel like it , the blizzard won t last forever and it will be spring again soon just because we cannot control the weather , doesn t mean we have to live outside in it we can come inside we can wear warmer clothes we can adjust we can practice coping skills we don t have to live out in the elements we don t have to settle with the way things are i got this analogy from dr scott hahn and his audio cd , love unveiled , from lighthouse catholic media organization he used the weather to talk about feelings i took it a step further and applied it also to mental illness in ohio the other day , we had some snowy , icy precipitation the bad road conditions weren t the only risk i was facing that afternoon of the winter storm , i also had a routine doctor s appointment before i saw the doctor , the nurse took the essentials you know blood pressure , pulse , and gulp weight i kindly asked the nurse if she could not tell me my weight no problem , she murmured however , in going through the motions of her day to day job , she accidentally let the big red number slip immediately , she stumbled with her words and got out something that sounded like , well , that number , you are , it is in the normal range according to bmi a simple apology would have been nice i faked a smile , that s okay , i said i wanted to say , i don t give a shiitake mushroom about bmi , lady it is the number on the scale that gets me every time the number reflected on the scale when i step on it is always too large it doesn t matter how small the number is , or how much weight i lose it will never be good enough for me so , if it doesn t matter how small it is , it doesn t matter how big it is either with that enlightening self knowledge , i ve come to the conclusion that i d rather not know the number at all nevertheless , the damage s done i know the number the experience has already left me grappling in the dark for my self worth i immediately started planning to shave off calories from my meals and to go to the ymca every day by the grace of god , i am not worried that it will majorly set me back this time fortunately , i bounced back quickly and i was able to find some humor in the situation i invented a new definition for bmi bogus material info you may not think my acronym is funny however , i was literally laughing out loud when i told the doctor about my new found discovery he didn t quite understand , but you know doctors , all business oh laughter , you are a very powerful drug if you want to have a nourishing life , a more positive self image , and a holier existence , get rid of your scale it does n't matter what that number says you are perfect just the way you are when you die , are you going to think , gee whiz , i am so glad i spent all that time trying to be thin and worrying about the number on the scale ? i doubt it think about your ultimate goal
