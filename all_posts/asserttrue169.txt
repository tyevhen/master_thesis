i could use a job i 've been out of work for about two years took my first k disbursement recently my wife is on disability for schizophrenia , but now that 's she 's saddled with part b expenses for medicare thank you , state of florida , disability pays less than a month so yeah , i could use a job right about now but a fact came roaring into my consciousness the other night as i was dozing off to sleep i simply wo n't go on any more bullshit tech job interviews life is too short i have too much self respect what 's a bullshit tech job interview ? come on you know what i'm talking about the kind of interview where after phone screens the company brings you in on site , then has specialists tag team you all day in a series of minute mini inteviews , asking you programming and non programming riddles , making you jump through hoops like some sort of trained seal i'm not a trained seal any more i wo n't go to any more demeaning , dehumanizing , pompous nonsense interviews lunch ? sure phone interview ? yeah , of course tests ? maybe i can see where an employer might want to verify , with a practicum , that i know skills applicable to the specific job at hand fair enough but sit me down in a room with some wise ass asking me how i 'd determine the number of window panes in new york city , or some shit like that ? f ck the hell off just get the hell out most of the stuff on my resume is easily verified writing samples ? i 've got hundreds , online do i know computer science ? seven software patents licensed to apple , oracle , novell , others speak to that can i write code ? i have the death sentence in seven languages there 's no need for a day long interview if your precious culture is so intricate and brittle that i might break it just by coming onboard ? if it 's so piddly ass dainty that i need to come on site all day for the specific purpose of seeing if i 'll fit in , maybe you think a bit too much about culture how 's your business doing ? i 've been through the google interview process at google manhattan , a few years ago friends of mine have been through it it blows major chunks it 's more of an elaborate hazing ritual than an interview process how anyone can sit through five hours of being treated like a game show contestant and not feel insulted , i do n't know rackspace put me through a similar ordeal apparently even rackspace based , i guess , on their placing th , or something , in one of those fortune rankings of top companies to work for feels they can get away with imitating the google hiring style and take it from me , that 's all it is , a cheap imitation except , they also had me do a special marketing presentation to a room full of bigwigs , via phone conference , before bringing me on site to see if i fit in i worked for novell for years and adobe systems for , so i think i know how to fit in with other software industry professionals i have a track record , you see it 's not like i'm fresh out of college or prison and have to be treated as an unknown quantity for the adobe job , i had to submit to a test which i did n't mind at all , because the test pertained in a specific way to the job at hand it was n't a game show quiz it was n't a bunch of riddles they sent me a big wad of source code and said essentially here , document this for the end user , and also write developer doc , and also , while you 're at it , develop a small test program , in the language of your choice , to exercise the java classes , and document your test program so that an unskilled user could run it and know if it 's working properly the source code consisted of java classes , uncommented i was given two weeks to send my test results in i turned it around in hours the code was for a high performance web server , multi threaded and thread pooled in such a way that it would block neither at the file nor network i o levels this was for a technical documentation job , which i succeeded in landing after an all day interview in basel i'm all for answering questions but they have to pertain in some realistic way to the duties of the job , the thing i'm being hired for this was actually the case , in the adobe process do n't ask me far flung hypotheticals or make me speculate on matters of purely academic concern do n't pretend you 're going to learn how i think by asking inane game show questions please , just stop with the riddles if you want to know how many golf balls will fit in a ?
