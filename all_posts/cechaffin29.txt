my heart o my heart if you were not my heart but you are , you are , you are , you are ! were i not stuck in orbit i d depart this bed of tears for some far frozen star where from a throne of ice i might survey all human feeling as not worth my notice , my heart like steel , my eyes athena gray with wisdom , not compassion , only justice there i might judge the love you used to slay my dragon nature as a dangerous thing , an interruption of the world of play , a diminution of my alpha being still i cannot renounce this blessed earth while you remain to lend the planet worth namaste , craig erickson
