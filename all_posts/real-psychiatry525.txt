this is from the shrink rap blog this morning the consensus is that capitated care is better than fee for service care what is wrong with that picture ? starting out with the much maligned fee for service ffs most medical and psychiatric services are not delivered in that context you can safely say that ffs , disappeared a long time ago according to a medscape survey of , physicians across specialties only worked in cash only or concierge style practices that means that everyone else is subject to varying degrees of insurance company discounting from my years of providing inpatient care for example , there is a standard drg payment based on a global discharge or admission diagnosis for the most common psychosis drgs the standard payment is , no matter how long a person is stays in the hospital the same thing happens on the outpatient side i have discussed this more extensively is a previous post looking at the commonest outpatient billing code actual reimbursement for providing services can be as little as per visit in the case where bills are submitted with cpt codes common to all of medicine medicare pays of the usual and customary charge for psychiatry compared with for the rest of medicine a lot depends on contracting arrangements since a contract can limit a psychiatrist to billing only a code and the company can also decide that they disagree that services were provided and either deny payment or demand repayment of a significant amount of money based on a review of the documentation the business adaptation to this on the hospital and managed care side if they own the hospital is to hire case managers to get patients out of the hospital within or days some of these systems have confabulated their own guidelines that allow them to do this that are totally independent of any professional standards so if you are a managed care business and you own the hospital you are winning at two levels you already shift the risk to the providers and hospitals by the medicare style drg payment and you do it a second time by insisting that they go along with the business decision to discharge the patient from the hospital strictly speaking , the examples of discounted fees are technically not capitation discounted fees still allow for some elasticity within the system because there is still a fee paid per service event capitated systems of care like behavioral health carve outs can be set up to pay a set fee for managing a specific population for example , a system of care is under contract for providing all services to a specific group of employees for a rate that is negotiated irrespective of actual patient visits the best way to understand capitated care is that it is designed to provide insurance companies a significant financial incentive for rationing care that incentive comes directly out of the total amount of money available for health care spending psychiatry , mental health , and addiction services were the easiest targets due to insitutionalized stigma , lack of a vocal constituency , and the political ineptness of psychiatrists it is anybody 's guess about how much a managed care company can make for denying or rationing care but some estimates of the margins have been as high as one thing is for certain capitated care is not a comprehensive national health system it takes hundreds of billions of dollars out of the health care system and diverts it to ceos and stockholders contrary to the political opinion it does not contain the cost of health care inflation one of the readers of the shrink rap blog pointed out that in a national system of health care you might be able to get an expensive medication like aripiprazole but you would have to wait longer in our current system of capitated care if your managed care company decides you will not be able to get it at all that is probably the best example of the difference george dawson , md , dfapa
