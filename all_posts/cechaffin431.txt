on television i watch the television it watches me eye to eye , the contest isn t fair the tv has more personality we are a symbiotic entity it feeds my brains electrons while i stare i watch the television it watches me when plots pile up into redundancy i still take pleasure in the clothes and hair the tv has more personality the tv can t induce passivity it seeks to rivet me with violent fare i watch the television it watches me i know the tube is not reality but can you blame me if i prefer it there ? the tv has more personality in my depression i must praise tv it grants a respite from my long nightmare i watch the television it watches me the tv has more personality the final default setting for a depressive is television , i think as homer simpson said , how can you not like television ? it asks so little and gives so much in my depressions it is a drug , like alcohol once the anxieties of the day are over , i can settle into my bed and watch re runs of law and order for hours and now with netflix , we are able to watch re runs of series i ve already seen , like six feet under there is more comfort in a re run , i think , since you know some of what is going to happen , and the reduced surprise leads to reduced stress and there s always the clothes and the hair to watch , as sam waterston in law and order sometimes gets a bad haircut last night kathleen opined that he was showing his age i replied that he just turned when i get out of this depression for good , my blog may change or appear less often , because my need to blog will be reduced by my participation in reality speaking of which , i turned in my book review for the philadelphia inquirer yesterday and the editor pronounced it good i was not beyond feeling a little better for that compliment , which argues that i am not in the deep kilorats of depression to have real positive feelings inside my chest would take a further revolution in my neurochemistry but it was good that i was not entirely immune to the feeling other happy items are kathleen s continuing hip and disk pain , and kenyon s bad wheel without medical insurance i feel helpless to help kathleen but some days are better than others yes , as the brother of father zossima in the brothers karamazov said , you are responsible to everyone for everything despite my interest in russian mysticism , that saying strikes me as an intolerable burden , though when my mood has been better i have seen great wisdom in the saying it s a shame that depression influences even the meaning i extract from my favorite books which makes tv all the more attractive thanks to jennifer danner for sending me a photo of a true kilobunny i tried to put the image in here but it would n't take at kilorats , ce
