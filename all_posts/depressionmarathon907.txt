it 's been snowing and snowing and snowing all day long i love it , although i may feel differently in a couple hours i'm about to go outside and shovel the inches in my driveway , and i have a long driveway ! the way it 's snowing now , there will be at least another inches by morning the snow , or maybe the extra sleep i got last night , energized me today i went for a mile run with puck this morning ! great news no left leg or calf pain bad news my right knee hurts ! ca n't win after my aa meeting tonight , i swam for minutes two workouts in one day not typical for me , but it worked today i love running in the snow i love the noise running shoes make on snow it 's kind of a quiet squeaking noise and i love watching puck leave happy footprints in the white stuff he was practically smiling throughout our run today unencumbered joy that 's my boy ! speaking of my boy , i spoke to the vet tech today about his biopsy apparently the lab wants to slice the sample into smaller pieces for examination , so we wo n't know the results until later this week keep those prayers coming , please i do n't want him to be sick i want him smiling and unencumbered for as long as possible !
