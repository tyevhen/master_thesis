i wrote these song lyrics when i was in high school , when i wanted to make a commitment , to god and my future husband , to purity in my life and love until i was married i never put these lyrics to music , though i hummed a little here and there , but i always thought of it as a song a love from the lord we have not met each other but i know that you are there someday our love will grow and we 'll be the perfect pair we 'll be brought together in god 's own time but i ca n't help wishing his time would be mine chorus and we 'll love each other with a love from the lord you will be mine and i will be yours it will be worth the wait there 's no doubt in my heart that in the strength of the lord we will never part i pray for you now as you go along your way that your best friend will be jesus and you 'll be close to him each day may your steps be guided by the light of his love and everything you do bring glory to him above chorus and we 'll love each other with a love from the lord you will be mine and i will be yours it will be worth the wait there 's no doubt in my heart that in the strength of the lord we will never part if you should love someone before our love comes to be please treat her the way you 'd want a guy to treat me and i pray that neither of us will do anything that ca n't be undone so that on our wedding day we can each say , you are the only one chorus and we 'll love each other with a love from the lord you will be mine and i will be yours it will be worth the wait there 's no doubt in my heart that in the strength of the lord we will never part amen yes amen it was years after writing these lyrics that , last year , i married my husband it was a much longer wait than i ever thought it would be , but today i am so blessed to see that in all the ways my husband and i stayed true to the pure desires in my song before we were married , we are reaping the joy , and love , and trust in each other and god that has come from that commitment thank you , jesus , for your help ! i love you , my husband ! it was worth the wait to be with you ! there is no doubt in my heart with god 's strength , we will never part cindy
