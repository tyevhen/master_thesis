if you follow my blog , then you ll be aware that i ve struggled with my health over the past couple of years i remain undiagnosed and , unfortunately , i still suffer from symptoms and pain it s safe to say that i sulked for a long time and still have bouts of the blues over this issue , however , as september arrived , i was filled with an overwhelming desire to feel better even if it was just a little bit as you all know , i do love a challenge and what better way to push myself than to sign up for the day shape shift sustain plan yes , days ! ! developed by the hottie , joe wicks , aka the body coach to say this training nutrition regime is hard work would be an understatement i m two weeks into the plan , and although i m still struggling with my energy levels , i ve just managed to run for ten minutes on the treadmill it sounds like nothing doesn t it , but when i think that for the past two years i ve struggled to walk for more than five minutes without having to rest then it s a massive achievement i must have looked slightly demented at the gym as i was sweating like i 'd run a marathon , and yet i couldn t stop myself from grinning ear to ear as my legs were burning , my lungs protesting , and my hair frizzing up under the pressure , all i could think about was getting home and adding this achievement to my happiness jar i blogged about embracing a good day and being grateful last year you can read that post here i m glad to say , i ve continued adding everything i 've enjoyed achieved embraced over the past eight months into my jar , and i can t wait to open it on new year s eve to remind myself what a fabulous year i ve had it doesn t matter how big or small our achievements are they are worth recognising and remembering i ve got days left wish me luck x
