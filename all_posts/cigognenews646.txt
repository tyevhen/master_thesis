recall is processed by the frontal cerebral cortex it recounts but cannot relive thus , there can be a recounting of an abuse by an adult when we were four , which may not be true a confabulation contrarily , reliving is systemic and all encompassing in reliving there can be bruises from birth that reappear the doctor s finger marks on the newborn s skin , or one begins to gag and choke as one relives oxygen deprivation at birth that is a sure event not to be confused with a recounting reliving includes how the lungs reacted , how much mucous was secreted during birth because during a reliving of birth it is again secreted recounting has nothing to do with it when i discuss right brain control , it is the orbito frontal right cortex that has direct connections to the amygdala of the limbic system with a well functioning right brain , there will be the ability to modulate our emotional output but we also need right left connections there must be right bottom to right top connection , and right top to left top connection , and right bottom to left top for total integration this may sound complicated , but for the healthy brain it is a no brainer the inhibitory neurotransmitters also work to prevent information from traveling over the corpus callosum to the left pre frontal area so we may have an awareness of an early trauma such as , my mother gave my dolls away , or she sent me to boarding school , but the part that hurts is repressed i need my mommy ! it is the suffering component that remains unconscious in the right brain it is that part that wants to inform the left frontal area , but to no avail we have a paradoxical need to feel the hurt , and not to feel the hurt to be protected from shattering pain , and at the same time , to connect to it and have it over with the encoded imprint is registered throughout the system recall treats an encapsulated left frontal brain as an entity in itself confusing that brain with the whole individual , so when the person understands we believe he is getting well only her left brain is getting well the rest remains sick the left brain , expert in strange concoctions , can really believe all is well while the dissociated aspect of memory , the suffering component , is writhing with its silent scream it is the right that gives us an overview of our lives and how we manage in it the left dissects , is analytical but cannot see the grand picture it can criticize but not create now we know where critics go and those in conventional insight therapy are talking to a brain that has no words and wondering why therapy cannot cure anyone it is a dialogue of the deaf from those who cannot see when the critical period is long gone , and we are able to tolerate serious pain we can begin the connection process in order to change , we need to go back to the critical period when fulfillment was absolutely necessary for life recall can never do that as adults we have a stable environment , are no longer dependent on neurotic parents , perhaps have love in the present , elements that allow us now to face our childhood meanwhile , the brain has done its best to block the feeling , providing detours from the right limbic information highway heading upwards and leftwards the blockage is not complete , however , because the feeling drives act outs no one wants me , becomes trying to get everyone to want her being helpful , kind , unobtrusive , etc the feeling becomes transmuted into physical behavior the energy , which needs connection , has gone to our stomach and created colitis , to our cardiac and vascular system with palpitations or migraines , and to our muscles , making us tense it may make us act meek and diffident as if no one wants us around it causes an inability for males to become erect what we try to do in our therapy is to allow feelings to go straight up the feeling highway to the right obfc and then to make a left turn to reach their destination connection is always the brain s prime destination if we only turn left and never go right , we will never make the connection i believe the system is always trying for connection , but it gets blocked by gating because of the constant push to connect , feelings tend to intrude and disrupt our thinking hence , the inability to concentrate or focus once connected , those diversions will no longer be necessary to drain the energy the energy always spreads to the weakest link weakest means a vulnerable area or organ either due to heredity or to damage done earlier in life a blow to the head in infancy may end up as epilepsy a history of allergies in the family may result in asthma later on our therapy is chosen by those who hurt , who often have too much access access from below is not the same as access from above the former means flooding , and not enough control the therapist needs right brain access so that she can empathize with the patient , sense what she is feeling , and know when pain should be avoided for the moment a therapist will earn the patient s trust when the patient senses that the therapist knows what is going on inside of her , does not make inappropriate moves , and allows for the free flow of feelings a therapist who interrupts feelings , who cannot sense the readiness of a patient to feel certain levels of pain , cannot be trusted that distrust is inherent in the situation no therapist who is left brain contained , who is circumscribed by ideas and insights , can be trusted none of that sensitivity can be taught we cannot teach feeling we cannot teach connection to the right brain we can only allow it
