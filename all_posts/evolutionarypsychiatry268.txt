blogging while out of town has proved more difficult that i thought for one thing , we have free babysitting , so we 've obviously been going out at night rather than staying in also , i am mostly limited to the ipad , which is n't as easy to blog from as a normal computer yes , cry me a river , but true nonetheless and i was planning on blogging about the creatine and vegetarians paper from the british journal of nutrition however , it turns out my institution does n't have access to the full text , and i really do n't want to shell out for a single paper that tells me to eat meat i already eat meat , and if you want your brain to be tip top , probably best you do too , or supplement , supplement , supplement with that growing list b , zinc , taurine , creatine , carnosine , etc etc but anyway a few weeks ago , dr aaron blaisdell , who i'm told will have access to all the best parties at the ancestral health symposium , was kind enough to send me this paper oxidant stress evoked by pacemaking in dopaminergic neurons is attenuated by dj the paper is a bit technical but hearkens back to a previous blog entry , brain efficiency in that entry i talked about how parkinson 's disease comes about when the dopamine making neurons of the substantia nigra thanks , ned poop out for some reason no dopamine in the substantia nigra , and you get stiffness , dementia , tremor parkinson 's disease parkinson 's is another one of those diseases that seems to be increasing faster than we might expect for the aging population it is postulated that oxidative stress causes the problems oxidative stress means burn out , basically too much gas for too long , too much build up of the toxic byproducts of making energy the burn out happens in the mitochondria , the energy factories of the cells which makes sense but no one knows why the mitochondria in the substantia nigra would be more vulnerable than the mitochondria in other cells increasing the efficiency of the mitochondria by using certain supplements such as coenzyme q and creatine which are also available from meat and organs from animal foods is currently being investigated as treatment for parkinson 's disease this new paper has some evidence for a mechanism why the mitochondria in the substantia nigra are so vulnerable as to be the canaries in the coal mine in the paper , researchers investigated some mouse substantia nigras ? and found that those particular neurons have some interesting properties they seem to pulse in energy output , rather like a pacemaker of some sort the pacemaking requires a lot of energy , as the cells have to let go of their energy and then build it up again at regular intervals since they burn through more energy doing this pacemaking than other dopamine making neurons in neighboring brain areas , they seem to be more vulnerable to excess oxidative stress so more vulnerable to burn out resulting in parkinson 's disease the solution or , perhaps better stated as the possible prevention is , of course , always pretty much the same eat a diet of nutrient rich foods and avoid poisons that will stress your brain say no to excess fructose , wheat , and omega fatty acids and fake , processed foods i have to say that going out into the real world on this vacation not my kitchen or pantry shows me once more just how ubiquitous the poisons are we checked out some pizza topping cheese like substance in a bag right next to the real cheese which looked like mozzarella , but was actually soybean oil , corn starch , and potato starch ick ! and guess what that mayonnaise with olive oil is still mostly soybean oil avoid ! coenzyme q rides around the body in your cholesterol carriers , so sufficient cholesterol is important we can make creatine , but when we eat it we get it mostly from muscle flesh vegetarians are low in creatine we have a certain design spec it is remarkably flexible , yet in the post industrial age we have managed to scribble far , far outside the lines of what our bodies consider food once again , straying too far for too many meals is really not a good idea
