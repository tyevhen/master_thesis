except today it was nothing but good stuff i took the teacher 's identity off of this and the school name , etc , but wanted to show you what the highlight of my day looked like today hi there i snapped these two pictures during play with big buddies today it was the first time we 've seen nate choose blocks to play with , better yet right alongside everyone else he stacked quite the structure and laughed when it did fall down he then went right on building it was great ! also , when the buddies had to leave , he followed them to the door when i shut it behind them he kept peering up to try and see out the window , like where did they go ? and then started to cry of course it 's no fun to see him upset , but it was also the first time we 've seen a reaction like that to the buddies leaving , like he wanted them to stay lastly , at recess , nate , judah and elliott sat alongside each other in the mulch , sprinkling it around nate usually likes the mulch , but it was cool to see them sit together and stay for quite some time sharing the same space yippee ! ! ! ! fyi , big buddies is a program where the fifth grade students come and play with the eci kids once a week what a great idea right ?
