i think it is normal to think about death and the end of our being but there are those obsessed with it why ? because their system is already obsessed with it in the sense that death is an imprint that the body has always been dealing with let me explain many of us come close to death at birth or before the massive anesthesia given to a pound mother is overwhelming for a pound newborn all of his systems are shut down and death lurks even though the baby cannot articulate it the system does in its own way and later when we are capable of articulation we are still obsessed but now we give it a name and an idea the death experience is ever present and does not go away because it is an imprint that cannot be erased in infancy and childhood that imprint can move the child constantly in hyperactivity then later in attention deficit problems , then still later a preoccupation with death enter religion its first task is to take care of death it provides an ideology and a belief that diminishes the threat it takes the place of the obsession now there is a new obsession god that idea suffocates the death fear for a time until the next prayer the belief has to be strong and persistant to keep the real fear at bay those who obsess about it have in general weak gating systems that is , the amount of early pain is so high that the gates have always been faulty death lurks constantly in the background and foreground it is immediate and the person thinks he is going to die now ! that means the memory is up on top just close to conscious awareness pills that suppress the pain do help and lower the belief system alcohol the same but the appointment in summara won t go away you know the story the man hears that death is coming to his village and so he escapes to sumarra only to learn that death has changed his itinerary and will come to sumarra there is no escape because we cannot escape the imprint it is real and that is what makes imminent death real
