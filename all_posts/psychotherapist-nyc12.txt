and belittling behavior in relationships her friends also thought he was immature and irresponsible when he told them that he was n't showing up for work because his boss did n't give him the praise he felt he deserved his attitude resulted in his losing one job after another nina defended him to her friends by telling them that they did n't understand him she saw a side of mike that no one else saw and she thought they were being harsh after listening to nina complain to them and then defend him many times , her friends were tired of of it they told her that it would be better for her not to talk about it with them anymore before the breakup , nina continued to see her friends , but she stopped talking about her relationship with mike and , at her friends' request , she no longer included mike in their get togethers because they did n't like him now , nina felt alone and miserable she could n't believe this was happening to her , and she did n't understand why mike broke up with her it was true , she said , she suggested that they move in together but she did n't expect mike to have such a strong reaction to their conversation , it 's not like i gave him an ultimatum nina 's psychotherapist focused on helping nina to get through this difficult time see my article developing internal resources and coping strategies she taught nina how to develop a wind down routine before going to bed so she could sleep better she also taught her how to do a relaxing meditation , a breathing exercise , and recommended that nina keep a journal to express her feelings once nina was more on an even keel emotionally , nina and her therapist explored the dynamics in her relationship with mike with an emphasis on nina 's self defeating behavior her psychotherapist explained the concept of self abandonment to nina and tried to help nina to develop insight into her own behavior but , initially , every time that her psychotherapist talked to nina about how she did n't take care of herself , nina would try to talk about mike and what he said and what he did in a gentle , tactful way , nina 's therapist kept bringing the focus back to nina and pointing out how nina kept avoiding looking at her own behavior because she was so focused on mike see my article overcoming codependency taking care of yourself first nina was n't accustomed to focusing on herself at first , she felt like she was being selfish and self centered see my article is self care selfish ? but , over time , nina began to understand how focusing on mike was a way to avoid looking at herself and that she would n't develop insight into what happened until she was able to look at her own dynamics in the relationship see my article changing maladaptive coping strategies that do n't work avoidance gradually , as the therapy progressed , nina realized that in her relationship with mike and in her prior relationships , not only did she focus on her boyfriend , she abandoned her own needs and gave away her personal power see my articles relationships are you giving away your personal power ? and taking back your personal power over time , nina also realized that she wanted so much to be in a relationship that she avoided the warning signs that were there all along and that her friends could see more objectively see my article are you ignoring the early warning signs in your relationship ? nina and her therapist were able to trace back these ingrained dynamics to nina 's family history as the oldest , nina became a parentified child to a single mother who turned to nina for mothering from the time nina was a young child she also expected nina to take care of her younger siblings nina worked through the trauma of her emotional neglect as a child see my articles what is childhood emotional neglect ? and what is the connection between childhood emotional neglect and problems later on in adult relationships ? she also talked to her friends about the breakup and what she was learning about herself in therapy when she began dating again , she did n't allow her fears to get in the way of being more discerning when she met men see my article choosing healthier relationships although it was difficult for her , nina also learned to like herself more and to take better care of herself conclusion self abandonment can occur in many different ways it often involves codependency in relationships , as illustrated in the fictional vignette above psychotherapy can help people who engage in this self destructive dynamic to develop insight , learn how to take better care of themselves , and change this self defeating pattern getting help in therapy self abandonment usually involves unconscious behavior that has its roots in early childhood it 's very difficult to change this self defeating behavior on your own , even when you 're aware of it , because the early roots of this behavior usually remain out of awareness working with a skilled psychotherapist , you can develop insight into your behavior and change your pattern of relating to yourself and others see my articles the benefits of psychotherapy and how to choose a psychotherapist it takes courage to seek help in therapy to change see my article developing the courage to change by taking care of yourself and choosing healthier relationships , you can lead a more fulfilling and meaningful life about me i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist see my article the therapeutic benefits of integrated psychotherapy to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at or email me
