i want the someone else , i do n't think i have ever felt like this before but i hardly know him i'm trying not to think too much but i hope i see him soon i hardly know him so i have to stop thinking about him i never really loved my ex in this fancying way i was infatuated with him , i loved him yes and i still care for him but i was not in love with him you can not love someone else until you love your self , i'm learning to love myself and it isopening up a whole world of new emotions i just want to talk to the someone else , even if nothing happens i feel like i could connect with him on a level i donot connect with other people my heart is aching but i must stop thinking ! he probably does not like me anyway but i wish i just knew , the more i think the more hurt i will be when i find out he does not like me
