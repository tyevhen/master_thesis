the shen , yi and zhi and needling in the nei jing the nei jing , and especially the ling shu , contains very many passages with instructions to acupuncturists as to how to needle all these passages give instructions as to how to engage the shen , yi or zhi of the practitioner when needling just as a reminder , yi is the mental faculty of the spleen which refers to focusing , attention , concentrating , idea its character is based on the heart radical which means that this mental faculty relies on the overlapping natures of yi and shen and therefore spleen and heart yi xin heart zhi of the kidneys refers to will power , intention , resolve , commitment but also memory , will its character is based also on the heart radical together with the character for shi which means scholar , soldier , gentleman , person trained in certain field , general , officer zhi shi scholar , soldier , gentleman , general , officer what is evident from all these passages is that the results one gets depend on the skill and sensitivity of the acupuncturist deriving from his or her shen , yi and zhi they are therefore very subjective two acupuncturists may use the same points but the results may vary depending on the subjective application of the mental faculties of shen , yi and zhi ling shu , chapter when holding the needle literally the dao of holding the needle , it should be held straight and not slanting to left or right the acupuncturist s shen should be on the tip of the needle and his her yi on the disease some translate the last few words as the acupuncturist should concentrate his her mind at the needle point and take good notice of the patient they therefore interpret the word bing , which means disease , as bing ren which means patient another source translates this as when inserting the needle , the doctor should concentrate his mind on the patient both these translations sound plausible but both miss the clear reference of the original to text to shen and yi as two separate mental faculties shen zai qiu hao , shu yi bing zhe both these translations miss the beautiful idea that the shen should be on the needle and the yi on the disease this makes complete sense if we consider that the shen , besides cognition , is responsible for what we might call muscle memory shen , yi and shi , all three are responsible for memory but the shen is responsible for intrinsic memory , i e for example remembering how to sew or ride a bike as opposed to remembering events , numbers , names , etc thus , the shen being on the tip of the needle refers to the skill , sensitivity and concentration of the acupuncturist on the other hand , the yi is responsible also for concentration , but also focusing , cognition , studying that the yi should be on the disease is a reference to the necessity of a laser like diagnosis , pathology and treatment of the disease our acupuncturist s skill would be for nothing if our diagnosis and treatment are wrong ling shu , chapter concentrate the shen on one point and the zhi on the needle notice the distinction between the shen and the zhi , similar to that between shen and yi of chapter this distinction is completely lost in a modern chinese translation concentrate the attention and focus the whole mind on needling this statement is in the context of the description of the optimum conditions for needling a patient acupuncturists should be in an isolated quite place , carefully observing the mental state of the patient , close all doors and windows , tranquilize the mind , concentrate the attention what they translate as tranquilize the mind is actually so that hun and po are not scattered and what they translate as concentrate the attention is actually focusing on yi and concentrating the shen ling shu , chapter the famous chapter of the ling shu entitled ben shen is frequently quoted , especially its famous opening sentence i would like to comment briefly on that sentence and propose a different translation of it the opening sentence of chapter of the ling shu is fan ci zhi fa , xian bi ben yu shen and the words mean literally every needling s method first must be rooted in shen this sentence is usually translated as all treatment must be based on the spirit the implication of this sentence is that all treatment must be based on the spirit of the patient , whatever interpretation we give to the word spirit i propose an alternative translation with two important differences firstly , the text uses the word ci which means to needle , not to treat if the text had meant to use the term to treat , it would have used the word zhi which does occur a lot in both the su wen and the ling shu thus , the first difference is that the first half of the sentence is when needling rather than when treating this is an important difference the second difference is that the shen referred to here may be interpreted as the shen of the practitioner , not of the patient therefore , the whole sentence would mean when needling , one must first concentrate one s mind shen if that shen is the shen of the practitioner , then mind would be a better translation here this interpretation is consistent with two factors firstly , the ling shu is very much an acupuncture text and therefore the reference to concentrating when needling makes sense secondly , the advice to concentrate and focus when needling is also found in many other places in the nei jing indeed , the word shen is even used occasionally to mean needling sensation chapter of the su wen says in autumn needle the skin and the space between skin and muscles stop when the needling sensation shen arrives there are many passages in both the ling shu and su wen that stress the importance of concentrating one s mind when needling indeed , chapter of the su wen contains a sentence that is almost exactly the same as the opening sentence of the famous chapter of the ling shu chapter of the su wen contains this sentence fan ci zhi zhen , bi xian zhi shen i would translate this so for reliable needling , one must first control one s mind shen note the beautiful rhyming of zhen with shen the english translation of the su wen by li zhao guo simply translates this sentence as the key point for acupuncture is to pay full attention my interpretation is corroborated by the other paragraphs in that chapter which give advice as to how to practice needling in fact , it says that the acupuncturist should not be distracted by people around or by any noise unschuld , in his new translation of the su wen , translates this sentence as for all piercing to be reliable , one must first regulate the spirit this translation would contradict mine but a footnote in the same book reports the interpretation of wang bing the editor of the nei jing one must concentrate one s mind and be calm without motion this is the central point of piercing notice that unschuld says piercing and not treating su wen , chapter this chapter has similar recommendations about concentrating while needling it says do not dare to be careless , as if one looked down into a deep abyss the hand must be strong as if it held a tiger the spirit shen should not be confused by the multitude of things , that is have a tranquil mind zhi and observe the patient , look neither to the left nor to the right after this passage , the text says that one the acupuncturist must have a positive mind shen by looking into the patient s eyes and control his her mind shen so that qi flows smoothly the modern chinese translation of this passage is to keep the mind of the patient concentrated means to prevent the patient from distracting his or her attention so as to make qi flow smoothly the translator here takes the first reference to shen as the shen of the patient while i interpret it as the shen of the practitioner that must be concentrated note how all meaning is lost when the chinese medicine terms are translated the distinction between shen , yi and zhi when concentrating in needling is lost when these are translated as attention or translating so that hun and po are not scattered as tranquilizing the mind or translating focusing on yi and concentrating the shen as concentrating the attention or translating the beautiful expression the shen on the tip of the needle and the yi on the disease as when inserting the needle the doctor should concentrate his mind on the patient or translating jing shen not focused and zhi and yi not logical as cannot concentrate mind or make logical analysis or when the essence spirit is not concentrated and when the mind lack understanding as for the translation of shen as spirit or mind , that would require a long dissertation suffice to say that in all these passages shen refers to concentration , analysis , focusing attention and therefore mind would be a better translation of it acupuncture and shamanism shamanism was the form of healing prevalent in china before the warring states period bc disease was caused by invasion of evil spirits gui and healing was performed by shamans reciting incantations shamans used to do this also fending the air with arrows and spears the character for medicine yi in use before the warring states period is made up of the radicals for ancient weapon made of bamboo shu , quiver of arrows yi and shaman wu during the warring states period the radical for shaman in the pictograph of medicine was replaced by the radical for herbal decoction the shaman had been replaced by the herbalist quiver of arrows bamboo weapon shaman cave , acupuncture point xue evil spirits used to reside in caves called xue which is the same character as acupuncture point i am of the opinion that shamanism was the origin of acupuncture i think it is a short step between fending the air with an arrow to drive out evil spirits and actually piercing the body to drive out evil spirits from the caves in the body i stress this is only my intuition and i have never read any corroboration of it the early connection between shamanism and acupuncture in my opinion is mirrored in the many nei jing passages describing the skill , intuition and sensitivity of the acupuncturist depending on his her shen we are not shamans but there is a shamanistic quality to acupuncture , it is an art and it is very subjective i have noticed this also when i would get excellent results and the patient would feel very much better whenever i repeated that same acupuncture treatment , it never yielded the same results because the conditions of the first treatment influenced by subtle , subjective factors due to my shen and its interaction with the patient s shen could not be reproduced it is interesting that during the northern song dynasty there was a strong movement towards establishing medical schools and editing the classics of chinese medicine the nei jing was edited three times by imperial committees as part of this clean up of medicine , there was a drive towards eliminating shamans and the shamanism that was prevalent in the south during the northern song dynasty , southerners medical customs and reliance on shamans were considered almost barbaric usually in a degree increasing with their distance from the northern centre their deities were labelled demons gui , their religious officiants were labelled shamans wu and their healing practices were described as noxious song officials concern focused on the southerners preference for local shamans over physicians which was seen as the root of their ignorance of medicine in some prefectures , prefects even forced shamans to change occupation and apply themselves to acupuncture ! their shrines were destroyed if acupuncture has indeed shamanistic qualities much more than herbal medicine , it may explain the difficulties of conducting acupuncture clinical trials an acupuncture treatment is subject to very many variables , to the subjective state of the practitioner s shen , to the interaction with the patient s shen , to the intent , skill and sensitivity of the acupuncturist , all of which may make it difficult to conduct clinical trials , especially if they are based on a standard acupuncture prescription even in modern china , acupuncture doctors teach about directing the needling sensation simply with the power of shen for example , in nanjing they taught us that , in order to direct the needling sensation downwards along a channel , we should press with the thumb behind the point and visualize with our shen the downward movement
