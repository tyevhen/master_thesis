bea systems may have invented something quite novel and useful in a recent patent application , bea 's john schneider proposes using xml schema definitions as data types in , say , ecmascript the main intuition is that you would use an import statement to make the interpreter aware of a particular schema definition from that point on , you could instantiate whole objects based on that schema def , or if it 's a simple data type declare variables to be of type myelement xsd and manipulate them directly type checking is delegated to the schema validator and suddenly you have a scripting language that acts like a strongly typed language and groks xml to boot at first blush , it sounds and feels a lot like a new twist on object relational mapping , but it 's actually a bit more than that this goes to the heart of language design and behavior neat i wonder what bea plans to do with it next ?
