agreed that nina was not living up to their agreement , and he agreed to talk to her but sam found himself unable to talk to nina because he felt guilty about not being around when she was growing up

couples counseling , martha was talking about divorce and sam was despondent , caught between his daughter and his wife after a few sessions , they realized that they allowed nina to move in without a well thought out plan although they could n't go back to undo that mistake , they talked how to resolve this situation in a way that would preserve their marriage and try not to alienate nina sam also entered into his own individual therapy to deal with his guilty feelings about not being around for nina when she was a child soon , they came up with a reasonable plan that they both agreed to , and sam presented it to nina nina felt hurt initially , but she eventually came to understand that martha and sam wanted their home back so , within two months , she found another job and moved into her own apartment with her children the tension between martha and sam was resolved , and they were closer than before , and sam was able to make amends with nina for neglecting her as a child betty and
