of your career workplace coping with a difficult boss in this post , i 'll consider certain types of bosses that most people would describe as difficult and provide some suggestions that you might find helpful since there are so many different kinds of difficult bosses , i'm sure i wo n't cover everything , and your comments are valuable so that i can include more information in the future workplace coping with a difficult boss it 's also important that , since no one can truly understand a situation with a difficult boss unless you 're in it , just like anything else , you need to use your judgement about your particular situation as to whether my recommendations would work for you let 's start out with certain premises first , it 's important to understand that one person 's opinion about a boss might be very different than another 's , so that what you might consider to be difficult others might find appealing second , it 's possible , as hard as this might sound , that your difficult boss might actually think that he or she is doing a very good job your boss might lack any kind of self awareness about his or her behavior also , it 's possible that this behavior might actually be encouraged by his superiors the other factor to consider is whether or not you 're contributing to the situation by your own behavior this is an especially difficult thing to acknowledge so , you need to look at your own behavior in the situation and be honest with yourself about your role in the situation and how you might need to change yourself in order to change the situation what is a difficult boss ? as previously stated , one person 's idea of a difficult boss might be the ideal for someone else it can be very subjective however , here 's a few of the most common difficult boss categories that i usually hear about in my office recognize that , for simplicity 's sake , these are stereotypes people are more complex than stereotypes and , to a certain extent , what you 're dealing with might be different or a combination of several types the micromanager dealing with a difficult boss the micromanager the micromanager usually likes to feel in control of the most mundane aspects of a project often , he or she is insecure and cannot allow competent staff to carry out their duties without having staff constantly coming back to him or her at every step of the way to get approval he or she can bog down projects with unnecessary meetings , sign offs , telephone calls , and other time wasters and , generally , annoy the staff with his or her need to oversee every little detail the hands off manager the hands off manager is just the opposite of the micromanager he or she is usually disengaged from the work and the staff he gives little direction and leaves the staff wondering what he wants with regard to goals and objectives sometimes , he might not know or he might think that he is allowing his staff to take charge however , the effect is often inefficient and ineffective if the staff guesses wrong and must waste time and effort redoing a project the fault finder dealing with a difficult boss the fault finder the fault finder is similar to the micromanager and some people consider this type of manager to be a subset of that category the fault finding boss is usually very critical and looks for what 's wrong most of the time and gives little or no credit for what 's right this type of boss can demoralize the staff quickly he or she might look for the smallest mistake to point out , possibly overlooking a generally excellent job this might be because his own level of competency is limited and he cannot judge the project on anything more than the smallest details or it might be his character whatever the reason , after a while , the staff will often lose their motivation to do a good job because it is almost never recognized this , in turn , can make the fault finder even more negative the indecisive manager the indecisive manager cannot make up his mind what he wants as a result , he either gives little or no direction similar to the hands off manager or he keeps changing his mind the indecisive manager is often insecure or he might be inexperienced possibly , he was thrown into his position with little or no training and he is not really competent for his job the result is that he will often frustrate the staff with changes in direction or goals for a project , wasting time and effort the boss who takes all the credit dealing with a difficult boss the boss who takes all the credit the boss who takes all the credit for your ideas and your work , giving you little or no credit , is often a manipulative and insecure person if he was not insecure about his own position , he would be generous enough to give you credit he is often the boss who that will go to his superiors , without your knowledge , and claim responsibiliity for your ideas the bully dealing with a difficult boss the bully bullies are one of the most difficult types of bosses to deal with on the job often , they know that they 're bullying the staff and either they do n't care or they think that this is an effective way to get people to do their jobs or they just do n't know any other way these types of bosses are usually insecure and angry in general they might not act this way at home with their spouses because their spouses might not put up with it and they might be very accommodating with their own superiors , but when they come to the office , they enjoy having power over their staff they might yell or scream , demean people in staff meetings or be hyper critical the bully gets off on power and control just like any other bully , like the schoolyard bully , there 's often a scared person underneath it all who is hiding his fear by bullying his subordinates around also see article hr , it 's time to show bullies the exit the sexual harasser sexual harassment is a big topic it can take many forms it can range from inappropriate comments to be a quid pro quo situation where your manager offers you a raise or a promotion if you have sex with him if you are being sexually harassed by your manager and if you work for a large company , you can speak with your equal employment opportunity officer to get help sexual harassment is against the law and it often does not stop unless you take steps whatever steps you decide to take if you 're in a small company , you can go to your local , state or federal eeoc agency to get help only you can decide the best course of action for your particular situation , but you should educate yourself as to your options go to your local , state or federal eeoc website to get information you might decide to leave , if that 's an option for you i'm sure you can think of other types of difficult bosses how to handle the difficult boss once again , you know your situation best other than the sexual harasser and the bully who might require you to go above his head or outside your company for help , if you think that your manager does n't realize the effect he or she is having on you , consider whether this is someone that you can talk to privately to discuss the situation if you think your manager would be open to it , ask him or her for a convenient time when you can talk privately i'm stressing privately because a public confrontation is usually a bad idea it might make you feel good at the time , but the repercussions are usually bad first , your manager will be humiliated and wo n't hear what you have to say second , you 'll be seen as someone who does n't know how to handle difficult situations third , you might get fired assuming that your manager is open to it and schedules a time for you , organize your thoughts before the meeting by writing down what you want to discuss you do n't have to discuss every time and every situation this would probably not be effective however , a few examples would suffice also , rather than just focusing on what 's wrong like the critical boss , try to find some things you think are positive , if you can in addition , if you have some suggestions as to how the situation might improve , talk about them , once again , if you think your manager would be receptive to it if you think that speaking to your manager might make things worse because he or she cannot tolerate hearing any complaints , then you need to decide how to proceed is there a human resources department ? do you have confidence in them ? do they have any authority or power to change the situation ? are there other colleagues who are experiencing the same problems with this manager ? in certain situations , it might be better to go as a group rather than your going alone however , in other situations , you might be perceived as a troublemaker if it gets out that you 're the one who organized people so , once again , you must use your judgement there are some situations with difficult bosses that are not likely to be improved for a variety of reasons one might be that this is the culture of the particular workplace where you are and these problems go to the top another might be that your boss is the head or the owner of the company and he feels that he can do whatever he wants another reason might be that talking it out with an insecure or angry boss or with his boss or the human resources dept could make things worse your boss might never trust you again and might try to take steps to get you fired it 's important for you to be able to read the particular situation that you 're in and decide if it 's worth it to stay or if you should leave there might be particular reasons why you 're staying for a while maybe you 're close to retirement or the job market is not good or you know you 'll need to take family medical leave soon and you wo n't get it immediately at a new company there can be so many different reasons that 's why it 's a very personal and individual decision one important factor to consider is how this boss or this job is affecting your self esteem and overall well being if you feel that working under your particular circumstance is having a detrimental effect on your self worth or affecting your relationships at home because you come home stressed out and upset on most days , then it might be worthwhile to start looking for another job hopefully , your encounters with difficult bosses will be few and far between in a long , successful career however , if you feel that you are stuck and need support on how to
