all i want to do is sleep i think i have taken on too much recently o i have been on a course , i have a big deadline at work and i am buying a flat it has now become too much for me it did n't seem that much a little while ago , the days just were n't long enough because i had to take my medication to make me sleep this was just to keep my routine not because i was tired my energy has now drained and all i want to do is sleep the only thing that stops me calling in sick tomorrow is i love my job and it feels like a sicky i am going to do the minumum possible for a while , minimum work anyway !
