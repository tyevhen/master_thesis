i just had an evening in where i met someone from a dating website problem is he is genuinely a nice guy who is the perfect gentleman and bought me flowers and the oldest wine from his collection but i do not think i fancy him we snogged for a bit but he did not get me excited he is comming back tomorrow and i think i am going to have to end it i have seen him three times now but i do not think there is any future in it i am thinking more about how i am going to wake up in the morning for work than i am about him i think tomorrow night is going to be extremely difficult maybe i should let tomorrow happen , and then break over the weekend as i have plans and naturally i would not want to see him maybe after the break i should make my decision he is a lovely genuine man but does not excite me maybe if i give it another evening , but i really do n't know love does not hapen over night so maybe i should give it a bit longer i do not want to be on my own for life but neither do i want to be stuck with the wrong person my mother has always resented my father and no way do i want to be in that situation what to do ? ? it is early days , he is the perfect gentleman and i do not want to be old and alone wondering what might have been o i do not feel threatened by him in any way so maybe give it a bit longer
