day viii hollow men there is an absence greater than absence of life there is a hollow hollower than death when the lights go off in the gunman 's eyes and every man becomes a purse there is a loss greater than loss of pleasure when there is no breast or nipple and the nurse removes your pacifier and the wailing of your deprivation goes unnoticed in the bassinet and your infant body shakes into the grief of sleep or when standing at the railing of your crib and there is no mother and no substitute for mother in the endless darkness might as well change yourself after this you may spend your life seeking a substitute for the milk dewed nipple and the warm pillow of breast pressed against your face during the rhythm of the bliss of your sucking ix my poetry addiction there is so little poetry left in the world i suffer its loss as much as cigarettes it may , in fact , leave a bigger emptiness is it love or addiction ? sometimes i think the latter , especially when i am around poets and feel the heat of their narcissism rise like steam from a meatloaf , most without craft , an ear , rhythm or form , who cannot write a sonnet to save their souls despite their endless infantile hunger to be heard the difference for these junkies is external dependence only another can shoot you up with self deluding praise plato was right and wrong he never imagined the democratization of poetry , fearing aeschylus and aristophanes not angelou and bukowski you say i have switched to prose i say form must fit function in this proliferation of venues and dilution of talent on the fleet street of the internet and overpriced coffeehouses forget poetry , poetry sucks as much as cigarettes poetry sucks donkey dicks in the dead of night poetry sucks the butt holes of rabid bats poetry sucks the big walla walla like a staubsauger poetry is a concentration camp for narcissists poetry is eternal competition with every poet , living or dead poetry causes stillborns , curdles milk and stains the altar with pig s blood poetry is bread in the mouth of a pigeon spreading legionnaire 's disease poetry is the word flu fuck poetry
