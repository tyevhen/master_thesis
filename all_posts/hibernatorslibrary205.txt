i think we all have some idea of what we think ptsd is , but it turns out ptsd is n't as clear cut as i thought apparently , when ptsd was first introduced into the dsm , the diagnostic criteria required a traumatic event outside the range of usual human experience that would cause significant symptoms of distress in almost anyone that fits pretty well with my own perception of ptsd rape , war , torture , violent experiences these all fit into that description ptsd is a normal response to an abnormal stressor however , in the dsm iv , the nature of the traumatic event broadened drastically , and a requisite response was intense fear , helplessness , or horror so in the dsm iv , ptsd was a pathological response to a potentially less extreme stressor someone could be diagnosed with ptsd if they experienced intense horror or helplessness after watching a scary tv show or upon being diagnosed with a terminal illness although i do n't wish to undermine the intense stress that someone with pathological responses may feel , i think this definition undermines the intensely awful experience that someone with ptsd in my mind has encountered the statistics agree with my assessment of these criteria in a community survey , of people reported that they had been exposed to a traumatic event and had responses that could potentially qualify them for a ptsd diagnosis luckily , the dsm tightened the traumatic event criteria again , and broadened the range of response to the traumatic event now , the traumatic event must occur directly to the subject , and they can exhibit other pathological responses besides intense fear , helplessness , or horror to be diagnosed with ptsd by dsm standards , a person must be exposed to actual or threatened death , serious injury , or sexual violence they must exhibit one of the following symptoms intrusive distressing memories of the event , distressing dreams reliving the event , dissociative reactions , intense psychological distress at cues that remind the person of the event , or marked physiological reactions to cues that remind the person of the event additionally , the person must persistently avoid stimuli associated with the traumatic event , have negative alterations in cognitions and moods associated with the event e g distorted cognitions about the cause or consequences of the event , and alterations in arousal and reactivity e g hypervigilance or angry outbursts in general , people respond to trauma with decreasing pathological symptoms in order to be diagnosed with ptsd , the patient must have experienced these negative responses for more than month , otherwise they are experiencing acute stress disorder despite the common association of ptsd with war veterans , ptsd is actually more common in women than in men and the traumatic events are more often domestic violence or rape than war however , a great deal of money and time has gone into research of ptsd in war veterans during wwi , symptoms of ptsd were called shell shock , and were thought to be caused by brain hemorrhages however , this belief slowly subsided as doctors realized that the symptoms presented themselves regardless of injury by wwii , traumatic reactions were known as operational fatigue and war neuroses , before the terminology finally settled on combat fatigue during the korean and vietnam wars a rigorous longitudinal study of ptsd by smith et al in found that of military personnel deployed to iraq or afghanistan had ptsd of those , the rate was higher in those that had experienced combat compared to those who had n't an issue that is rightfully ! getting much attention lately is the high rate of soldier suicide between and , more than , soldiers took their own lives generally with a gun there are several risk factors that increase the likelihood of ptsd being female , lower social support , neuroticism , preexisting depression or anxiety , family history of depression , substance abuse , lower socioeconomic status , and race ethnicity apparently , compared to whites , african americans and hispanics who were evacuated from the world trade center in were more likely to get ptsd there is also a genetic factor that increases susceptibility to ptsd preliminary studies suggest that people with a particular form of the serotonin transporter gene may be more susceptible to ptsd than those with the normal form of this gene on the other hand , there is at least one factor that promotes resilience to traumatic events intelligence it 's possible that people with higher intelligence are better able to make sense of the event by viewing it as a larger whole or an intelligent person may be better able to recognize and buffer cognitive distortions such as i deserved that , why should i have lived when they died ? and if i had only done , this would n't have happened researchers have come up with several ways to decrease likelihood of succumbing to ptsd after a traumatic event stress inoculation training has proved successful with members of the armed forces soldiers can be exposed , through virtual reality , to the types of stressors that might occur during deployment thus they are better able to deal with the trauma when exposed to the events in real life debriefing after a traumatic event can also be helpful this allows the victim to process the event in a safe environment , before the details become internalized interestingly , one study showed that subjects who were exposed to a highly disturbing film were less likely to report flashbacks if they played tetris for minutes after the film than if they sat quietly for those minutes this team of researchers also showed that simply being distracted after the disturbing video was not enough to decrease flashbacks , and that doing a verbal task actually increased the number of flashbacks so , apparently , visio spacial tasks decrease the likelihood of intrusive flashbacks if performed immediately after the traumatic event i'm not sure this information is particularly useful , but it 's interesting as of yet , there is n't a highly successful way to cure people with ptsd cognitive behavioral therapy , which helps the victims recognize cognitive distortions e g i deserved that , why should i have lived when they died ? and if i had only done , this would n't have happened , can be helpful in reducing anxiety antidepressant medications can alleviate some of the depression and anxiety experienced by victims one up and coming treatment has shown promising results someone with ptsd can undergo prolonged exposure to the traumatic events they can do this through repeatedly reliving the events out loud , or even by re experiencing them through virtual reality unfortunately , many ptsd vitimcs drop out of such treatments because reliving the events is too difficult however , this treatment method has proven very helpful to people who complete the process , and i hope that work in this area continues this is a series of posts summarizing what i'm learning in my abnormal psychology course much of the information provided comes from reading my james n butcher 's textbook abnormal psychology to read the other posts , follow these links the definition of abnormal a history of abnormal psychology abnormal psychology in contemporary society contemporary viewpoints on treating mental illness biology contemporary viewpoints on treating mental illness psychology frontline new asylums brave new films this is crazy clinical mental health diagnosis biological assessment clinical mental health diagnosis psychological assessment does the dsm encourage overmedication ?
