just realized this is the longest i have gone without posting in months i truly am in a funk i wake up every morning , look at my kids and think you want breakfast again ? the prospect of completing the morning routine is just overwhelming at the moment , as is working all day and dinner ? what dinner ? was i supposed to cook that ? oops what 's the issue ? i am sure that some of it is depression , which is something i have battled intermittenly throughout adulthood but much of it is pain i am on day of yet another migraine and it 's just getting old a few weeks ago i was watching that commercial on tv the one about using botox for chronic migraines i listened to their description of the appropriate candidate for this treatment and felt sorry for individuals in that situation then i started to think back i would say i have averaging migraines a week these past few months with most of them lasting several days it 's pretty awful , and actually , it puts me into the category of acceptable candidate for botox not that i'm going to do it , but i guess i just did n't realize it had gotten this bad i have been going to a chiropractor to work on a back injury you know , from when i moved the elliptical machine to the garage and told him about the headache situation he did quite a bit of work on my neck last week when i went , cracking things way too many times to be normal the good news is that for about hours i was completely pain free not counting my back then the headache came again i was supposed to search for triggers also , so far this is what i found jack 's meltdowns , any arguments , running , coffee , beer , wine , cocktails , menstrual cycle , too little sleep well that pretty much covers everything now does n't it ? i would be even more nervous if i had n't had a head ct last fall during a particularly awful headache , one when i thought i was having an aneurysm everything looked ok , and migraines run in our family , so i have attributed it to that of course , brain tumors also run in my family ugh luckily the boys have been pretty good the past few days , and i have been getting some rest , in the evenings thanks to my hubby i just need a break from all of this , it 's yucky what i really need is a few days away from all of the stressors and responsibilities of this life my husband always answers that we should definitely try to do that sometime , we need time away from the kids i laugh i meant me ! all alone ! tall order i know , and not likely to happen , but a girl can dream i can picture it now me , quiet , my own bed sigh i'm sure anyone who has migraines can completely relate i feel so blah
