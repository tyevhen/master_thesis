the hobbit , directed by jules bass , arthur rankin jr the lord of the rings , directed by ralph bakshi the return of the king , directed by jules bass , arthur rankin jr when i first told my aunt that they were making a lord of the rings movie , she disinterestedly said meh , there 's already one of those these three gems are what she was talking about after re reading the hobbit and lotr , i decided to hunt down these movies i borrowed the first from netflix , saw the second in a theater , and could n't find the third the hobbit was undeniably a children 's movie just as the book was a children 's book there was silly dialog , and silly action scenes and the dwarves were just as silly as they were supposed to be in fact , it took me quite a while to get used to the animation because the old fashionedness of it added to the silly factor the lord of the rings , in contrast , was very serious the battle scenes were surprisingly violent for a cartoon neither my boyfriend nor i remembered that much violence from when we were kids watching the movie , so it must not have been too very traumatic , i guess the story of the lord of the rings ends quite suddenly after the battle at helm 's deep because they could n't get the rights to the third book in the trilogy the return of the king was not a sequel to the lord of the rings , but to the hobbit the same animation studio was used for both , though the second movie was a musical , which added to the movie greatly in fact , this song is one that i remember from childhood , and i was thrilled when i could find it again
