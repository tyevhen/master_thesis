i took these pictures while organizing my meds the other day why ? i guess it was a reminder without my medications including my allergy meds , i would n't be doing as well as i am today i do a lot of things to keep myself healthy physically and mentally i go to bed early i get up around the same time every day i exercise a lot i eat well for the most part i work on my sobriety and attend my aa meetings i spend time with friends i try to keep balance in my life it 's a hour per day job unlike some others on the web , i 'll never reject the need for my medication a few may call this sad , stupid , or brain washed one of my favorites i call it reality i am alive and well today because of all the work i 've done , including the work i 've done with my psychiatrist , and my willingness to take my meds as prescribed it 's been a team effort , and it 's worked well for me
