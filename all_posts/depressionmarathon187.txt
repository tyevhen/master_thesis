not much has changed around here since my last post my lungs are still not quite right , but i am breathing a bit better than earlier this week i took my last doses of prednisone and the antibiotic today , but i'm hoping they 're not done working , as i still have a way to go before i 'd say i'm breathing normally despite struggling for breath occasionally , i'm proud to report i continued to go to the gym this week i took either a cycling or strengthening class each of the last four days i took a break and went for a quick walk today the cardio efforts were definitely tougher this week , but it felt good to get some air deep into my lungs nonetheless i'm working on losing the pounds i gained during my depression relapse , so i'm glad i had the energy and motivation to continue exercising this week i'm also happy to report i had the energy and motivation to do something pretty special today i went to work for two hours boy , i was anxious ! but i did it i evaluated a patient , did all the necessary paperwork , and interacted with my co workers for the first time in two months it went well , i think two months is a long time to be away from work going back was , and is , a huge goal i fumbled a bit with some new paperwork requirements , but otherwise i think i covered everything i was supposed to cover today even though i was anxious , and exhausted afterward , it was nice to be back among the working i'm glad i got those first hours out of the way i plan to continue working a few hours a few days a week until i get fully back into the swing of things i'm grateful my mood and energy levels have continued to stabilize i ca n't say there 's been huge improvement in my mood over the past week , but at least i have n't gone backwards at this point i feel like i'm slowly inching away from the abyss i'm cautiously optimistic i 'll continue feeling better and better , but the darkness is still too near to celebrate yet
