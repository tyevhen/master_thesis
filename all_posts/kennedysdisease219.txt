unfortunately , every winter i have to go through a new acceptance process learning to live with kennedy s disease is also about learning to live through the winter with this condition yes , i know that this too will pass in approximately four months i will be relishing the warmer temperatures and my newfound strength until then , i will be doing a lot of mumbling and grumbling temperatures are dropping and my strength is declining with it i know , it happens every winter , but it is still somewhat unexpected perhaps i am just hoping that one winter i will not have to experience this phenomenon again my left thumb and index finger are in worse shape this year and it isn t even winter yet my overall strength has also declined over the last month how do i know the decline in strength is related to colder temperatures ? good question when the temperatures warmed up a week or so ago to the mid s with nights in the s , my aches disappeared and my strength was back i was completing all of my exercise routines and reps without a problem i did not feel chilled once it was wonderful this week has been cold , windy and wet i just can t seem to get warm , my muscles are aching , and my exercise routine is labored i am back to wearing gloves , both inside and out of the house i wear socks to bed at night because my feet will not warm up my electric blanket runs seven hours straight and it is the only relief from the cold that i can control there is something to be said about the benefits of snow when i lived in minnesota , washington and pennsylvania and there was snow on the ground , i did not feel as cold as i do today i believe the snow captures the moisture in the air and makes for a more comfortable environment the cold , damp weather of northern georgia seems to impact my muscles more perhaps this is just part of the progression of the disease coupled with my age whatever is the cause , i do not like it i have discussed this issue with my neurologist and still do not feel comfortable with the answers i am getting it just seems strange to me that temperatures in the low to mid s would have such an impact on my strength and pain yes , i do spend two hours or more outside each day walking the dog the golf cart has a winter cover that partially protection , but i am still sitting for thirty plus minutes at a time sometimes in high winds and rain this is just another reason i know that i have not fully accepted this disease how about you ? does the cold bother you more these days ? do you feel weaker during the winter ? have you ever received an explanation as to why this happens ? i look forward to hearing from you misery loves company
