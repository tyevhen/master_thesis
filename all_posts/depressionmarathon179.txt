it was november , , when i first noticed i was n't feeling quite right having had depression as a teenager , i recognized the feeling it had been many years , but i knew that feeling i took action i got a psychiatry recommendation from a friend and called to make an appointment unfortunately , the doctor was booked out until march , i was hospitalized before i made it to her office depression , like any other illness , is no respecter of gender , socioeconomic class , or stage in life when my depression began years ago , i was happily married , owned a home , had two cars in the garage , worked full time in a job i loved , and had money in the bank depression got me anyway over the next several years , my treatment resistant depression took everything from me i lost it all , the house , the spouse , the job , and the money in the bank it was tough to make matters worse , i began drinking to stifle the pain it did n't take long before i added alcoholic to my list of diagnoses hopelessness was my constant companion fortunately , i do n't live in that darkness today in those early years , i truly suffered from my illness today , i live with it i do n't think there was a definitive turning point perhaps things started to change when i began to speak publicly helping others helped me i ca n't say i'm grateful to have depression , but i am grateful for the lessons i 've learned because of depression losing people and things taught me i was stronger and more resilient than i thought i learned i could survive with less i learned how to ask for help and accept that which was offered and most importantly i learned i had something to offer others educating and supporting others gave my life some direction i had a purpose i think it was that sense of direction and purpose which led me out of the constant darkness and back into the world i got sober i began working again after years of disability i started this blog i spoke up i attended to idle relationships i became more willing to work with my doctor i developed a sense of perspective and gratitude depression no longer controlled my life living with depression is much better than suffering from it , but that does n't mean i relish it this has been a long , tough , educational journey i hate the relapses into the abyss the lasting fatigue frustrates me i 'd like to work more , have a little money put away , and perhaps be in a relationship i'm sure my life would look much , much different today had it not been interrupted by depression but i would have missed out on a lot of important lessons , too i'm satisfied with who i am today , happy even , and i believe that 's in large part due to the lessons i 've learned over the past years sure depression has been challenging perhaps i 'd be better off had i not experienced it but then again , perhaps i would n't on second thought , i know i would n't
