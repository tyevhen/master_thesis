whoopee ! i saw my doc today and got weighed i was shocked ! i 've lost pounds ! i have n't weighed what i weigh now since december , ! i love weight watchers online ! i'm telling you , this program is amazing ! i ca n't believe how easy this has been and i 've not been hungry , which was my biggest fear geez , i could be a weight watchers spokesperson ! by using the ww points system i 've learned to eat mindfully , and that 's been the most positive thing that could have happened i eat whatever i want , but i pay much closer attention to what i'm putting in my mouth i think about what i'm having and plan for later meals when making food decisions i never did that before i just ate when i crave something , i think about whether i need it before i speed through the drive thru sometimes , i decide i do need it usually , i can satisfy my craving with something worth fewer points i 've really changed the way i eat i have n't given up anything either last week , i had a brownie batter blizzard at dairy queen ! but i'm certainly eating fewer treats than i used to , and when i do have them , there 's more thought behind them i 've had fewer fancy coffees , french fries , and desserts i can now eat one cookie rather than three or four that 's amazing ! sometimes my eating felt out of my control before now it feels totally within my control i think that 's been a pretty big deal i think i 've been more motivated to exercise , too exercising earns extra points , which means extra pasta , burgers , or ice cream again , i'm more aware of the energy i'm putting out and the nutrition i'm putting into my bod cool these results were all totally unexpected it all adds up to me feeling better about me my clothes fit much better , and i look better in them running is easier because i'm carrying around fewer pounds , and that motivates me to run more and i feel good about successfully sticking with this program it 's all good i'm happy
