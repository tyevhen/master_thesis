this post could also be titled , another one bites the dust catchy , do n't you think ? both titles are appropriate depression has cost me a lot over the years so many valuable assets , like self confidence , financial independence , and employment security , have been lost to this illness it is the king of thieves and it has struck again remember d ? he was the boyfriend i had been building a relationship with since last june well , he 's gone another victim of this selfish illness , he was unable to hang in there as depression ravaged my life over the past couple months it was n't dramatic it was more of a slow , quiet disappearance and then he was gone i last saw him at christmas we spent it together in fact , i got out of the hospital , after three days , in order to travel to his home and be with him for the holiday it was wonderful one week later , i was back in the hospital it was then that he began to pull away i heard from him less and less , and only if i initiated the contact finally , after a long period of silence , i phoned him last week we talked but it was too late he was already gone it 's too bad i will miss him i already miss what we were building together my friends tell me i deserved better maybe that 's so , but d was where i was putting my energy and i liked him i respected him we were good together it 's frustrating to lose to depression once again it 's too bad he could n't see past an illness it 's too bad and that 's about all there is to say about that
