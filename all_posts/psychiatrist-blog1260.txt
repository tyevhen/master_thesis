if you 'll look at the photo above , i'm standing towards the upper left , about , rows back from the capitol building , people in from the edge , kind of near the native american museum i have one or the silver invitations to the ceremonies , which put me up front with the chosen quarter million i'm standing where i can sort of see a jumbotron , except for the tree in front of it and the people in the tree it 's cold it 's crowded it 's really crowded , and i'm thrilled to be a part of the event there 's not much to say beyond that since commenters have asked about my travel plans i stayed with a friend in the 'burbs , got dropped at the metro about am i got a seat , but the train quickly filled i stood in the wrong line for over an hour , but there was no way i could have known that , and no where i could have moved anyway more lines , cold , and i expected all these things , so it was fine there was no wind chill factor because all those bodies shielded me from the wind the first metro stop i passed had long lines formed down the street i tried union station and could n't get near it i sat for a while on the floor of the lobby to the postal museum the woman next to me was talking on the phone about how she was way in the front , seated and there were marble bathrooms she saw usher and oprah and denzel we were at different events , clearly , but both landed on the floor of the museum lobby as inaugural refugees oprah and i would hit it off right away , i'm sure of it all the while , i was getting text messages from the metro system alerting me to various crowds and shut downs i texted a friend who works in the district to see if maybe he wanted a visitor i do n't know if he was near me , but what 's a few more miles to walk in a crowd on a glorious day ? he was inside a building , waiting for the parade , but did n't invite me to join him i tried the metro stop in chinatown , and got through right away a train pulled up just as i reached the platform after the first stop , i got a seat , and there were taxis lined up at the station on the other end i got to my car , drove another hour , and was home by what an exciting day ! i 've never seen so many people in my life , anywhere , ever congratulations , president obama !
