see comment on post below i have had a chat with mr apparently creepy guy and made it clear we are just friends , it has un nerved me a bit that people in the real world read my blogg it is not that bad but it the idea takes a bit of getting used to i think i will start telling my old friends non cyber friends about my blogg it was never suppose to be a secret mr apparently creepy guy has made me think more about my blogg , from now on i am going to be a lot more careful about what i post to ensure no one would be able to predict my movements and stuff i have also removed the link from the social anxiety website it is a shame but i am feeling a bit exposed right now paranoid or careful it will make me feel happier ? oh well bloggs go on
