this post has moved to http asserttrue blogspot com last responsible moment html please forgive the inconvenience a military officer who was about to retire once reportedly said the most important thing i did in my career was to teach young leaders that whenever they saw a threat , their first job was to determine the timebox for their response their second job was to hold off making a decision until the end of the timebox , so that they could make it based on the best possible data this is an illustration of a principle that i think is sadly underutilized not only in r d circles but in project planning generally , namely the principle of delaying decisions until the last responsible moment championed by the poppendiecks and others the key intuition is that crucial decisions are best made when as much information as possible has been taken into account this is a good tactic when the following criteria are met not all requirements for success are known in advance the decision has huge downstream consequences the decision is essentially irreversible if one or more of the conditions is not met , the tactic of deferring commitment might not gain you anything and could actually be costly , if it holds up development conventional project planning , as practiced in enterpise today , tends to overemphasize the need for completeness in requirements gathering the completeness fetish leads to the big huge requirements document or big huge rfp syndrome and can introduce unnecessary dependencies and brittleness into implementations there 's a certain hubris associated with the notion that you can have a complete specification for something you almost certainly ca n't you almost certainly do n't know your true needs ahead of rollout true , some decisions have to be made in the absence of complete data you do n't always have the luxury of waiting for all the information to arrive , and there 's the fact that you need to start somewhere even if you know that you do n't know what you 're doing yet but that 's not my real point my real point is that too often we make decisions ahead of time that we did n't really have to make , and later realize we should n't have made based on the usually false assumption that it 's possible to know all requirements in advance what i'm suggesting , then , is that you reconsider whether it 's always a good idea to strive for a complete specification before starting work on something accept the fact that you ca n't know everything in advance allow for emergentcy good decisions are often emergent in nature reject the arrogant notion that with proper advance planning , you 'll have a project that goes smoothly and results in a usable solution most of the time , from what i 've seen , it does n't work out that way not at all
