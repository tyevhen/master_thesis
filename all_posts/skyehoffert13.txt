a story when life becomes too much , the act of living too suffocating i would read , reading was my therapy i like to think of myself as an escape artist i made the best of a terrible situation , by pretending it away pretending , i was better and more than i am being a dragon slayer or heroine in some story was a far cry better than the weak , unassuming floor mat i was back in reality somewhere along the line , words started meaning more to me than people words did n't hurt or berate me , people did i got realities confused i became a story a jumble of words , that nobody ever bothered to read
