as frequent readers of my blog know , i am not a huge fan of flying thankfully , i have my recovery tools to help me this week i had a day trip that required me to be on four planes in one day i tried to remember that anticipation is often worse than realization on the first flight i was very nervous and on edge i did not make a full effort to address my symptoms by the second flight i knew i had to make my mental health a business so instead of sitting and worrying , i decided to focus on reading my graduate class 's textbook amazingly , even when the plane experienced turbulence , i remained calm and indifferent i applied dr low 's method of using objectivity to concentrate on something else this strategy worked on my third flight as well on the fourth flight i spoke with a fellow passenger during the trip to keep my mind off my fears another form of objectivity and once the trip was over , i endorsed for having the will to effort and tolerating uncomfortable feelings before recovery i would have been terrified during the entire experience i might have even avoided the trip altogether but with my recovery training i know it is not how i feel but how i function that really matters despite some uncomfortableness , i muddled through i chose obligation over inclination , and i demonstrated leadership in my own recovery process
