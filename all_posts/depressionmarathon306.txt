i 've decided i'm going to go ahead and run my local marathon this sunday my running has been going fairly well i think i'm fully recovered from boston and i'm feeling good why not run it ? i'm hoping to run better , and feel better , than i ran and felt in boston , but i also do n't want to over do it i'm focusing on having a good effort at grandmas marathon in june , so i do n't want to run so hard i jeopardize that i 'd like to use this as another long training run at the same time , i know myself , and if i'm feeling good on sunday , i 'll likely go for it despite my best laid plans it will be an adventure either way i'm looking forward to it
