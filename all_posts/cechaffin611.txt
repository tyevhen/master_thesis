first , as of yesterday , we moved into our own rented domicile , and slept on linoleum in sleeping bags without a chair to sit on , in a house schmegged up by a former stoner tenant with ashes and bud trace everywhere and seedling pots , and mouse turds in the cupboards but at least this slacker launched , since of men , i read today , are still living with their parents anyway , our new landlord , whom we call i'm not crazy bill because one morning he called me to discuss the building of a water tank and only afterwards realized i was n't the contractor so he left another message assuring us he was not crazy , and it stuck very nice man as a landlord he has a lot to learn still , in that he 's not charging us to crash in the redwoods in the modern two level studio with the large windows and skylights until the place is ship shape , hey , where 's the downside ? only in our aging bones send us a mattress asap kathleen proceeds to ny on thursday for a spell i proceed to rachel and jacob 's first daughter and only grandkid on the same day and will stay until i'm not welcome , but i figure the more babysit my boy , the happier mom will be , and i might even get three days without a scene one can hope daughters are forever finally , today , below , the conclusion of the deprivathon , the longest poem i 've ever penned it may end more with a whimper than a bang , but is n't that the way giving up an addiction goes ? i mean , being a non smoker becomes almost commonplace ? although i do describe my greatest know dangers for recidivism anyway , for those who have n't glanced this way , since i'm not announcing a new blog until i post the poem in its entirety , the work covers the first six days of withdrawal that was enough time for god to create the world , likewise enough time for a poetic journey in a world of video blogs thanks to c bagley for hanging with me for the duration ! thine as ever , dr chaffin the deprivathon , day x will i make it ? when asked why she did n't quit , bette davis asked , then how would i talk ? while furiously gesturing with her cigarette holder and what if as a non smoker i become seriously depressed when the faces of familiar cars look strange and i am firghtened by doorknobs and tea kettles , when whatever spark of self i knew flies up and out the chimney into the wailing dark ? that is always one danger , when smoking or not smoking appear equally pointless in a universe mostly composed of dark matter so why should i care if i smoke ? in that state , which will come again , i must pretend to care against all evidence the other danger is similar as on a very good day , say your daughter s wedding or grandson 's baptism , when the joyful conviction of invulnerability convinces you you ve finally got control and you can have just one yet on a day like this , betwee cycles and rather stable , i choose to imagine a silver angel with glacier blue eyes and crystal hair swooping down like a winged victory to pluck my desire in her gleaming hands and throw it back to heaven like a coal finis
