why is change so uncomfortable ? what is it that makes us so resistant to it ? we have a new employee at work , and today was the last day of work for the therapist she is replacing i like the departing therapist a lot i really enjoy working with her we have similar viewpoints , similar lifestyles , similar work ethics i do n't want her to leave what we have now works yet , she 's moving on to something new i ca n't change that the new therapist will probably be fine she seems quite competent , friendly and hard working the patients seem to like her i do n't dislike her she 's just different new a change i welcomed her to the staff , but i was guarded i could have been more open and welcoming why is that ? what makes me resistant to the new and different ? i 'll miss working with my friend , but perhaps our new therapist will become a friend , too maybe i 'll even learn something new and different from her ! but i still wish things did n't have to change
