this past week , i exhausted every possible coping skill on my extensive list well , at least , i did all the ones on my winter list the ones i could on my own ok , i guess the list wasn t that long now that i think about it i really tried to make painting work toward my advantage , this week and many times before then it seems so sensible i m having a bad day , so why don t i sit down at my easel , swirl around some paint , and let the brush take me away to magical places of peace and tranquility but , i can t no matter how hard i try , painting doesn t come naturally to me i just end up getting so irritated and down on myself even more i was so irritated the other day that i even put everything away boxed , shut , in the closet , and easel packed up and under the bed maybe , if i am more intentional about painting rather than having it out all the time , i will actually do some creating i don t know , probably not one day last week , i finally gave up trying to fix the problem , and i sat down at the kitchen table i received some lovely flowers last week from my mom they are so bright and cheerful and they smell so nice looking at them is a little oasis from the dead , cold winter we have a really nice camera that takes really good pictures no matter how bad of a photographer you are i got out the camera and started taking pictures of my flowers then , after the mini photo shoot , i put the pictures on my computer and edited them in a very basic photo program on windows the result ? the new header picture for this blog it represents more than just time for a change it reminds me that i can t always be confined to lists and shoulds and oughts they have their place as well however , sometimes i need to just let myself alone i do n't have to fix the problem all the time so , i can t get myself out of this funk that s ok it s ok if i don t do anything productive it s ok that i don t work it s ok that i don t have the next big thing happening in my life it s ok if i don t get everything done that i want to get done it s ok if i don t do anything at all ! often times , when i am feeling more depressed than usual or i am having lots of tormenting eating disorder thoughts , i want to fix the problem right away if i can t fix it right away , then i get even more down , more discouraged , and i end up making matters worse since i ve been through the worst when it comes to depression , i am afraid of going down that path again so when symptoms pop up and don t go away , i freak out on the other hand , since i am aware of it , i know what the warning signs are and i won t let myself get that bad again and neither will my husband , family , or friends let me go there again i am really blessed to have such wonderful family and friends i 've had several great conversations that have literally got me through this week unscathed it 's so hard for me to ask for help i am blessed to have people in my life who offer their help without me having to ask i learned the lesson , again , that i have to be patient with myself i m also reminded that i need to give myself permission to feel down i am allowed to feel sucky it doesn t mean everything is falling apart it doesn t mean i am having a relapse it just means that its winter and it sucks and i am allowed to feel sucky
