i 've looked at a few stats on my , twitter followers , and some of them are kind of interesting i 've always wondered how often my people are actually online , using twitter this is a difficult thing to quantify , but thanks to tweepi com , i now know , people out of , tweeted in the last minute , tweeted in the last minutes , in the last day , in the last month the numbers are tricky , because we ca n't simply say that in any given minute period , about , people of , total followers will be online , because there might be users online who do n't tweet in those minutes the online part is suspect , too , since many people set their tweets for scheduled automated push offline nevertheless , in a rough qualitative sense i think it 's clear that only a very small percentage of users can be found online at a given moment this is consistent with half my followers tweeting in a given hour period an implied average rate of per hour divided by how many followers do my followers have ? have less than followers have less than followers have fewer than followers median followers if you have , followers or more , you 're in the th percentile i do n't know if my followers are representative of twitter as a whole , but it sounds about right to me that of twitter users have fewer than , followers so , but twitter users tend to follow more people than they have following them the median number of followees is , thus , it 's not atypical that a person has followers , but follows , people this , again , squares with everyday observation who are my top followers in terms of follower count ? here are the top ten twitter name followers who is this ? barackobama president , u s hootsuite twitter app yokoono the one and only tonyhsieh ceo of zappos numbergov david cameron , uk prime minister tweetdeck twitter app firefox the browser i use most elnacionalweb venezuelan newspaper thebenlandis songwriter leopoldolopez leopoldo l pez , venezuelan politician and economist of these , i was surprised to find i actually follow only four myself i took a look at the twitter users with whom i have a mutual relationship i e , where we both follow each other recall that twitter relationships can be outbound , inbound , or mutual i have around , mutuals to get an idea of who they are , i did some keyword searches on the user 's bios here are the interesting , i think results keyword in bio number of people writer author music ian market er , ing blogg er , ing photograph er , y editor actor coach christ ian ceo coffee comedian junkie actress comedy novelist empty no bio screenwriter chocolate literary agent the tricky thing here is that people do n't always state their occupation nor their interests in their bios for example , comedians' bios are often one liners wait this is twitter every bio is a one liner never mind an actor might give the name of a show , or an imdb com url , or just leave the bio blank an editor might say i work with words or i translate english into english thus the above numbers should n't be taken too literally why do i follow so many people ? is n't it hard to keep track of their tweets ? i use lists a lot , in order to see just what comedians are tweeting , just what authors are tweeting , etc still , it 's a lot to keep track of on the other hand , when major news hits , i often learn about it in seconds if fukushima melts down , i 'll know right away conversely , if i need advice on something , or a research tip , i get it instantly once , i was trying to find out what some of the worst funniest , most poorly conceived children 's toys are i posted a tweet asking for help within seconds , i got the info i was looking for but the real reason i follow so many people is , i consider my twitter contacts to be a much more valuable rolodex than , say , my linkedin contact list i'm not in constant contact with my contacts on linkedin most of them , i have n't touched base with in years some are dead my twitter followers are very much alive i routinely purge accounts that have n't tweeted in the last days , and there for me many of them have reached out to me with a request i always try to help when i reach out , they help it 's a great system i have thousands of people i can reach either via a public tweet , or via an e mail that begins with we follow each other on twitter recently , one of my followers a movie producer asked to see a copy of my screenplay she read it , liked it , and is now anxious to show it to a colleague who executive produced a recent major well over million box office gross motion picture this is the kind of thing that would not have happened for me without following a great many people on twitter that 's my excuse what 's yours ?
