in case you have n't heard , roy is on vacation he 's blogging us the day to day update , complete with photos and mishaps starting with the flat tire on day clinkshrink is also on vacation in fact , her vacation was inspired by roy 's photos from his vacation last year greetings to all from baltimore where the remaining co blogger remains okay , so last week i had a hour getaway to the beach where i was hosted by my good friend the judge in curlers my three hour drive was punctuated by a text photo that clinkshrink sent to my phone of her car packed for vacation bikes on the back , and a lengthy discussion with my shrink friend , camel as i arrived at my destination , my cell phone battery died dead completely dead oh , and bring phone charger i have three , plus one for the car that does n't work was the last thing on my packing list , and the one thing i forgot ugh ! i felt anxious inside , borrowed a blackberry to check my voicemail and call home , and i figured my first trip out in the morning would be to get a th charger the morning came and it was a lovely beach day breakfast , a walk on the boardwalk , and i suddenly realized i felt so much better with a dead phone and no email access this is what was meant by zen whatever that means i checked my messages periodically with the borrowed blackberry and reminded myself that no patient had ever called from a bridge ledge only to say they would have jumped had it not been for my brilliant and immediate intervention a break from technology i think it was a good thing i often think it makes it hard for us ever to fully relax when the urge is there to glance at the phone , make sure there are no messages , hit the inbox button okay , i confess , i do n't have a phone was my first thought when i was rear ended on the return trip no injuries , no dents , but i came home vowing to take it easier on the technology we 'll see and just so you know , i 've set roy 's new g iphone so that it barks when i call
