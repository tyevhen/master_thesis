ah , life it 's lonely , bitter , painful , and boring we live alone we die alone we suffer we die do i have the strength , the discipline , the willingness to see it through to the end ? i'm years old statistically speaking , i only have about years left , and in my case , probably less than that and the last years of my alloted time on earth will probably suck the big , hairy root vegetable my friend k called tonight one of my only guy friends all my friends seem to be women k is the only male friend i have who is willing to discuss real topics like death , aging , loneliness , horniness , career , etc right now , he 's in alabama attending his stepson 's graduation and dealing with his hellion of an ex wife , who 's a fucking cunt on wheels k and i are in similar situations we 're the same age ok , i'm months older we 're both developers , although he 's more of a mid level executive now , while i'm still a lowly code geek we 're both really burned out on our jobs because we 've been in the computer industry like forever maybe it just feels like forever in my case i 've been doing this work for years , which is like years in the real world i think computer jobs are sort of like dog years years of real time pass for every year of computer industry time anyway , k has been doing computer shit for over years , so it 's like he 's actually about fucking years old ! we are also both loners , and our love relationships with women always seem to be total fucking disasters i ca n't seem to keep a woman to save my fucking life , and k is divorced and dating a work fuck buddy up in vancouver , and that situation has been a total nightmare we 're also both afraid of dying alone , although that reminds me of a great quote from up in the air , which i just watched the other day starting when i was , we moved each one of my grandparents into a nursing facility my parents went the same way make no mistake , we all die alone now those cult members in san diego , with the sneakers and the kool aid , they did n't die alone i'm just saying there are options thank god for options , right ?
