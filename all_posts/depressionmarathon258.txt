it 's way past my bedtime , but sleep is not coming tonight today was the anniversary of puck 's death puck was my year old lab who died two years ago he went from healthy to gravely ill in moments i had about hours to say goodbye it was , as i expected it would be , one of the most difficult decisions i ever had to make and while i love jet with all my heart , there will never be another puck i still miss him puck was my soul mate he had been through it all with me only one year old when i became ill , we traveled the depression journey and later the alcoholism journey together i 've been thinking about him a lot over the past several days , which led me to thinking about my journey with this illness as well these thoughts , combined with the release of the videos , have me in quite the reflective mood speaking of the videos , it seems many of you have had a chance to view them healthination com has been having some technical problems with them , but they 're working on that they seem to work best when viewed on a computer versus a tablet or phone i want to thank all of you who have left your comments here while this was a huge opportunity for me , it was also a pretty big risk how many of you noticed i used my actual name ? i also did n't have any say as far as what went into the videos or not i had to have faith my message would be presented in a favorable way and it was i was quite happy with the videos of course , there is always more that could have been said , but i try not to worry about that i am satisfied by your reaction comments that we did put some education and hope out there for all to see if one life is brighter , or less lonely if one person sees themselves as having an illness rather than a character defect or if another who otherwise would n't have now seeks help , the opportunity and the risk was more than worth it i thank healthination com from the bottom of my heart and now i think it 's time for bed carry on , friends
