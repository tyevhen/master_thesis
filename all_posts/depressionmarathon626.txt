i finally got around to reading my october runner 's world magazine today one particular article had been recommended , and so i went there first the article was about frank shorter , the olympic gold medalist and olympic silver medalist , in the marathon he is widely known as the initiator of the 's running boom , and he remains revered within the running community to this day i was anxious to read the article my anticipation stemmed from the article 's focus titled frank 's story , it detailed the abuse he endured as a child in it , frank shorter discussed how his dad , a small town , heroic , doctor , mercilessly abused him and his siblings he detailed his memories of walking on eggshells around his dad , listening to him climb the stairs before he chose which sibling to beat with a belt , and of his father 's competition with his own children belittling their accomplishments rather than celebrating them those details were all too familiar to me i was so moved by frank 's story , and his brutal honesty , that i looked him up i found him , too after a few deep breaths , i dialed his number i recognized his voice on his voicemail , so i left him a message i told him how much i respected his honesty and openness , and i let him know i shared many of his memories i left my phone number , and three hours later he called back we talked for quite awhile me and an olympic gold medalist and i hung up amazed our shared experience brought us together in a way nothing else ever could amazing and just now , i am realizing that 's exactly what i'm doing with you through this blog sharing experiences most of you do n't have a clue who i am , and yet we are here , together , because of our shared experiences , whether that 's running , or depression , or a little of both i'm so grateful for my interaction with mr shorter today , and i'm thankful you are here , too , sharing my experiences with me thank you
