in my previous article , creating time for self reflection mindfulness , i began a discussion about mindfulness as one way to engage in self reflection and included some of the benefits of mindfulness self reflection and basic mindfulness techniques in this article , i 'll continue the discussion by providing some basic ways that you can begin to develop a mindfulness practice on your own , if you have n't done so already , so that you can reap many of these benefits the roots of mindfulness practice although mindfulness has its roots in buddhism , there are many other religions and spiritual practices that include some form of prayer or meditation technique that can be considered mindfulness techniques the roots of mindfulness buddhism but you do n't have to be religious or even consider yourself to be a spiritual person to practice mindfulness in your everyday life jon kabat zinn , the founder and former director of the stress reduction clinic at the university of massachusetts medical center , helped to bring attention to mindfulness practices to the general public the research that he conducted among patients showed that mindfulness practice can lead to physical and psychological improvements basic mindfulness techniques i think that many people , who are n't familiar with mindfulness techniques , believe that mindfulness techniques tend to be mysterious esoteric practices that would be difficult to learn and , as a result , they feel discouraged about learning to engage in mindfulness but , as i mentioned before , practicing mindfulness does n't have to be connected to any form of religion or spirituality although it can be , and it does n't have to be complicated at all there are many ways to practice mindfulness , so i'm going to begin with very basic techniques that can help you to get started mindfulness and the mind body connection one of the reasons why i love using mind body oriented approaches to therapy , like emdr , clinical hypnosis and somatic experiencing in my psychotherapy practice in nyc , is because i believe that the mind body connection is crucial for overall health and well being , and these types of therapy all have in common that they focus on the mind body connection mindfulness and the mind body connection since my focus in this article is how you can begin to develop basic mindfulness techniques on your own , i 'll begin with the simplest techniques that do n't involve attending psychotherapy a basic mindfulness technique noticing body sensations one basic way to practice mindfulness is to just notice the sensations in your body to practice mindfulness in this way , you do n't need to know how to meditate and you do n't even need to know anything about the mind body connection you just focus on your body a basic mindfulness technique noticing sensations in your body here are some simple steps focus on the physical sensations that you 're experiencing right now notice what you 're sensing in your body without judgement , which means just noticing this can include noticing an itch , a tingling sensation , a pain , a sense of fullness or emptiness in your stomach , muscle tension , scratchiness in your throat , and so on if you like this technique , you can start at the crown of your head and do a slow body scan from head to toe and just notice what you feel again without judging it if you get distracted , it 's okay just bring your attention back to your body another basic mindfulness technique noticing your emotions in your body after practicing noticing body sensations , if you find you enjoy this , you can add noticing your emotions in your body a basic mindfulness technique noticing your emotions in your body this is a technique that i use with clients in my psychotherapy private practice with emdr , somatic experiencing and clinical hypnosis , but you can also do it on your own see my article mind body psychotherapy the body offers a connection to the unconscious mind basic steps to noticing your emotions in your body begin by noticing body sensations as outlined above after you do a body scan from head to toe , begin to notice where you feel emotions in your body without judgment if you 're new to this , it 's easier to start by noticing certain sensations in your body and beginning to tentatively identify which emotions this might be related to so , for instance , if you sense tension in your jaw , tension in your shoulders or clenched stomach muscles , ask yourself what emotions might be connected to these sensations as you practice noticing emotions in your body , you will become better at identifying these emotions and using this information to develop a greater sense of self awareness one of the keys to practicing these mindfulness techniques is being nonjudgmental so , if you find yourself beginning to berate yourself for feeling certain sensations or emotions , just notice that you 're doing this and , if you can , allow those judgmental thoughts to float away another basic mindfulness technique notice your cravings noticing your cravings can help you to become more mindful of your cravings , whether it 's a craving for food , alcohol , drugs , overspending or whatever it is a basic mindfulness technique notice your cravings whatever the craving is , if you just notice it first , rather than immediately giving in to your craving , you 'll soon discover that cravings often come and go basic steps to notice your cravings begin by doing a body scan , as outlined earlier in this article notice , without judgment , where you 're experiencing these cravings in your body mouth , stomach , etc rather than denying or actively trying to get rid of the craving , just allow it to be if you do n't indulge in the craving , it often just passes notice what it feels like in your body and emotionally to have the craving come and go another basic mindfulness technique mindfulness meditation there are many ways to practice mindfulness meditation , so i'm going to focus on a basic way to get started after you 've practiced for a while , you can find your own way to practice a basic mindfulness technique mindfulness meditation basic steps to practice mindfulness meditation find a quiet place and time where you wo n't be interrupted for at least minutes you can increase the time , if you like , as you develop your mindfulness meditation practice sit quietly and notice your breathing notice what it feels in your body to breathe in and what it feels like to breathe out allow your thoughts to come and go without judging them or trying to hold onto them this includes both negative thoughts as well as positive thoughts if you get distracted , bring your attention back to your breathe again later on , if you like mindfulness meditation , as i mentioned , you can develop your own unique way of practicing but , in the beginning , this is all you need to do to start practicing acceptance , self compassion and being nonjudgmental allowing judgmental thoughts to come and go can take practice self reflecting and basic mindfulness techniques acceptance and self compassion when you start practicing mindfulness techniques , you might need to allow these thoughts to come and go many times that 's okay it usually gets easier over time with practice getting help in therapy many people have problems
