by jack smith i recently went through a period of profound suffering it was pure misery , and i lost hope the biggest mistake i made was suffering in silence i didn t even tell my wife , even though she knew she always knows she s like the people at the airport with the wands who make you spread your arms and legs to scan your body for weapons she scans me every day some days i can fool her , but she eventually catches on i suffered in silence because i didn t think our marriage , our family , needed it but i forgot my own advice i often give others who ask me for help don t try and do it alone it s too heavy a burden by the grace of god , i found hope again the black cloud lifted i m still perplexed by the mystery of suffering , so i thought i would share an excerpt from my book on the subject the book is basically finished the proposal is done , and it s in the hands of my agent , soon to be pitched to publishers it may not happen , but if i have to i ll make copies at kinko s to share with family and friends it s been a lot of work i hope you enjoy this little excerpt before i left my home for houston and treatment in the summer of , my year old daughter wrote me a letter i folded it and placed it in my bible i slid it out , unfolded it and wept as i read it on the plane on the way to houston i share it here , just as she wrote it , with her permission dear daddy , tonight is the night before you leave for houston i know this is the best thing for you to do right now , but i still don t want you to go a whole month seems like forever thinking about it right now , but i m hoping it will fly by without a second thought so many people love you , including our whole family they re going to be supportive throughout every step of this whole thing memaw , mimi , pop , friends , neighbors , uncle joel and uncle bill , i could go on and on the point is that all of those people who i just mentioned and more absolutely love you and want you to get better i m so thankful that you re alive you were given a second chance at life not everybody is there s a reason you didn t have enough pills , and there s a reason you re alive reading this letter right now god is not done with you once we make it through this tough little patch , he is going to use you in absolutely amazing ways your testimony will inspire people everywhere right now , you just need to do what s best for you and get better houston will be a once in a lifetime experience for you you re going to make unbelievable friendships you ll be able to meet and talk to people who have the same situation as you you will learn how to cope with this disease and have a happy and joyful life i ll be praying for you every single day and thinking about you constantly i m so proud of you for doing this it s going to change all of our lives for the better i love you more than words can describe love , sutton at the very bottom of her letter , sutton wrote a verse of scripture that not only changed my perspective it changed my life i consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us romans sutton s letter touched my soul in its deepest and most vulnerable place here was a young teenage girl offering her insights into suffering and her understanding that , at least while fighting for my life , i had to be selfish i had to put myself first and treat myself with kindness and compassion i also found comfort knowing that she was as much a part of my recovery as i was she also reminded me that countless friends and family loved me i learned that the love and support of our friends and family doesn t make real human suffering go away , but it gives hope to our hearts and helps light a path out of the darkness it also struck me that she was mature enough at age to understand that not only was i hurting , i was suffering the scripture she shared inspired me to read the entire book of romans in a new light i came to know paul better , to understand on some level his suffering more deeply , i began to understand the way true believers cope with suffering in romans , paul writes about how he turned suffering into hope i share the verses below because they may be the most profound words ever written on the subject of suffering therefore , since we have been justified through faith , we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ , through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand and we rejoice in the hope of the glory of god not only so , but we also rejoice in our sufferings , because we know that suffering produces perseverance perseverance , character and character , hope and hope does not disappoint us , because god has poured out his love into our hearts by the holy spirit , whom he has given us as my niv study bible points out , paul does not say we should rejoice because of our suffering , but in our suffering paul doesn t write that we must ask god for suffering or praise god because we are suffering instead , he writes that we should praise god even as we suffer i don t accept suffering as easily as paul i still have questions why does god allow children to suffer ? why would a god who can do any miracle he wants allow children in third world countries to starve or live in squalor ? why must any of us suffer at all ? as genesis tells us , god created the heavens and the earth , he separated the land from the sea , and he created light from the darkness god never took his hands off his creation , but once he set the world in motion , he didn t take away the darkness he didn t create a world without death or destruction or natural disasters if we believe in an all powerful god , then we have to believe god could have created a world in which there would be no flood or famine , pain or suffering he didn t in my limited understanding , that must mean god even had a plan for suffering if god allowed suffering and we are to be faithful , then we must rejoice despite our suffering rejoicing in our suffering and using it to spread the love of god surely cuts the enemy down at his knees he wants us to give up hope , abandon our faith , and wallow in our misery i know this because i have felt it and experienced it when i am deeply depressed , i want to give up i want to isolate myself from people and from the world i listen and believe the voices that tell me i will never feel good again , that i am not good enough and that god doesn t want me to have the life i hoped to live all of those thoughts and feelings come from a dark place , not a place god created that s easy to remember when my illness is in remission it s just as easy to forget when i am sick paul tells us that when we persevere through our suffering , we serve as an example and inspiration to others paul even used his suffering to spread the gospel he was imprisoned in rome when he wrote his letter to the philippians now i want you to know , brothers , that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel as a result , it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that i am in chains for christ because of my chains , most of the brothers in the lord have been encouraged to speak the word of god more courageously and fearlessly philippians in no way am i comparing my story of bipolar and depression to paul s ministry , but those words ring true as i have shared my stories and my pain , countless people who have suffered in silence have told me they wept when they read my story because it sounded so much like their own they have been encouraged to speak to others or seek help for their problems the words of theologian dietrich bonhoeffer in confession and communion are really about sin , but his words could just as easily be about suffering and shame one could substitute the words suffering or shame for sin and bonhoeffer s profound thoughts tell us a lot about how to deal with suffering in confession the light of the gospel breaks into the darkness and seclusion of the heart , bonhoeffer wrote the sin must be brought into the light the unexpressed must be openly spoken and acknowledged all that is secret and hidden is made manifest it is a hard struggle until the sin is openly admitted i have found that what bonhoeffer wrote about sin has been true in my battle with mental illness as it relates to suffering it is indeed a hard struggle , until we can tell our story , ask others for prayers and support , and break free from the chains of shame when those of us who suffer from mental illness talk openly about our pain and suffering , our secrets and our shame , we begin to understand that our disease lies to us it tells us something is wrong with our character that is a lie it tells us god must not care about us that is a lie it tells us we are not good enough that is a lie it tells us we will never get better that is a lie , too they are lies we have to fight every day not to believe a breakthrough moment for me came on that flight to houston for my three week stay at the menninger clinic while i felt relieved and encouraged knowing i was going to a place where i might get some answers and some help , i was also scared my biggest fear was coming home the same way that i left or failing to find a treatment plan that made me better i even put pressure on myself to make sure it worked since family and friends had become so invested in me i didn t want to let anyone down , a pathological problem i ve had all my life flying on a peaceful night on a quiet plane , my views on suffering and my prayers changed when i read my daughter s letter for as long as i can remember , i had prayed for healing like paul asking god to remove the thorn from his side , i had asked god to cure this cancer of the mind that had caused so much suffering and despair my prayer changed that night for the first time , i didn t pray for god to heal me i just prayed that his will be done , no matter what that meant for me if it was god s will that i suffer , so be it if it was god s will for me to go through storm after storm so i could help others , so be it
