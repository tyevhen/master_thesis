life is crazy ! in my last post i could barely manage my day at work because of my low mood my mood has been slowly getting better , but it has been so poor that i 've not even been living at home i 've been staying with friends in lieu of going into the hospital i 've been lower and more dark over the past weeks than i 'd been in the past two years previous to my mood difficulties , i told you about basically losing my job due to a lack of patients our agency had not been able to garner enough business to keep two physical therapists occupied because of that , i went out and interviewed for two new jobs then life turned on it 's head ! on monday , i worked hours because we were swamped with new patients ! on tuesday , i was offered both jobs for which i had interviewed yesterday , i was perhaps busier than i had ever been at my current job , again because we 'd suddenly been inundated with more patients than we could handle my mood has taken a back seat to necessity while still struggling , i 've really not had time to deal with it life is crazy ! it just goes to show you might think you are headed in one direction you may not even be able to see another possible direction you may think you are doomed , down , or even knocked out but god has a sense of humor , i think , or at least a sense of irony ! just when you 've determined life is particularly unfair , something turns around or , as is my case , everything , at once , turns on its head ! i'm hanging on for the ride
