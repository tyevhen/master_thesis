first , a couple of plugs since we 're still talking about the shrink rappers' trip to apa , i 'd like to steer you to peter kramer 's piece on what psychiatrists actually do at big psychiatric conventions nothing to do with apa , but we received a nice note from a psychiatrist , and he has a site for quickly looking up dsm iv tr codes unlike roy , i actually ca n't remember all the codes , so check out doctorcodes com okay , so oliver sacks i heard him speak just briefly at apa at the convocation of fellows he talked about musical hallucinations , and as he gave his talk , he mentioned that he 's been in twice a week psychotherapy with a psychoanalyst for years that 's a lot of decades of therapy roy 's comment kinda weird here 's what else i know about dr sacks i heard him talk on an npr show a few weeks ago he was born in england in his parents were physicians and , more specifically , his mother was a surgeon when he was a boy , he said on the npr show , his mother would bring home fetal body parts for him to dissect his brother does not think he should talk about this dinah 's comment kinda weird i 'll say it tongue in cheek , but this alone might cause one to need decades of psychoanalysis before i say any more , let me add a disclaimer i 've heard part of an npr 's fresh air listen here oh , he has a great npr voice i 've read the man who mistook his wife for a hat i 've heard him speak for roughly minutes at apa i think i saw the movie awakenings with robin williams i 've never met dr sacks , i 've never e mailed him , i have no knowledge of his life beyond what i 've heard him say in public this post borrows from him , but i have no idea why dr sacks has spent decades in therapy , and please do n't take my fantasies as reality i do n't know if dr sacks suffers from a mental illness perhaps he does , and perhaps that alone warrants all these years of treatment but maybe he does n't so , now we can digress into my fantasies dr sacks lives in new york city , a place where many of the worlds' psychoanalysts practice , a place where the practice remains alive , and where therapy is still accepted or was when i was a med student there as a means to gain self awareness and maximize one 's ability to live life to the fullest it 's not necessarily about curing illness it 's sometimes about a vaguer , more self actualizing goal , one that may be an on going process and one without a specified end to divert a bit , i once had a supervisor who volunteered to me that he 'd had decades of therapy unlike oliver sacks , he was n't a stranger , and i did n't have to speculate i asked why he told me his therapist served as a surrogate father , helped him to process his work , and that after he finished analysis , he wanted to continue to see him weekly rather than just bumping into him from time to time personally , i believe that psychotherapy is a personal endeavor if it 's helpful to you , do you need to justify it ? of course not , but in ways , society asks us to do this it 's expensive , it 's regulated , there are not enough psychiatrists to provide care to the mentally ill , so is it right that someone who is not in active distress should take up the precious time of physicians who might be better used elsewhere ? i'm told that there are only a handful of psychiatrists in afghanistan perhaps we should ship these psychoanalysts there to help the chronically mentally ill afghanistan citizens okay , so the question gets even more complicated should the long term analysand without a mental illness pass the bill along to her insurance company ? this again gets foggy i see patients who 've rapidly recovered from a major depressive episode if they continue to come for appointments , should the bill be passed along to the insurance company even if the patient has no active symptoms of depression at the time of the visit ? not every patient walks into every appointment in distress , and some people go up and down i imagine i do n't know that over the course of years , dr sacks has good weeks and bad weeks , whether or not he has a psychiatric disorder there are many who feel that with limited resources , our society should not pay for therapy for people who do n't have mental illness subjective distress is something you should pay for on your own , and self awareness is the same socrates told us that the unexamined life is not worth living he did n't tell us who should pay to examine it
