albert einstein spend the latter years of life in pursuit of a general field theory that is , something to explain how gravitational field sand electromagnetic fields intersect how they can be encompassed in a single englobing theory we are also looking for such a theory so that we no longer chase down every new symptom or disease as independent of all others this is particularly true when it comes to the psychologic and psychosomatic diseases what should seem obvious , that neurology , psychology and biology all intersect in the human body , seems to have been forgotten in the piecemeal approach in these three disciplines in order to understand them , therefore , we need to approach the whole system as it interacts i believe that what we have now is an inchoate primal field theory that links various aspects of the human condition together for example , in the field of biology there are tumor suppressor genes that control runaway developing cancer cells these interact with human experience psychology , even in the womb , that affects these suppressor genes and may allow for the development of cancer in addition that may then lead to later manifestation of brain cancer neurology if we look only at presenting pictures of the tumor our field of inquiry is quite narrow or if we look only at the presenting symptom of obsession we are again at a loss or if we examine only the blood system it is too confining to provide answers a primal field theory indicates how they all intersect and interact to produce disease i believe we will never arrive at causes until we embrace field theory otherwise , we are the position of knowing more and more about less and less studying the minutae of a symptom , hoping to discover ultimate causes it won t happen what i find even more important is how to treat these diseases a psychologic approach eliminates a rounded understanding , as does any single approach such as the neurological approach this permits such conclusions as someone acts out violently because he is deficient in serotonin or migraine is due to insufficient vasoconstriction so we add coffee to the mix , and the patient gets better is the problem solved ? the manifestation or symptom may be but not the basic problems how then can we be proficient enough to understand phenomena in all three disciplines ? there are possibly a few in the world who are competent enough but perhaps , that is not necessary perhaps , field theory can set the direction of research and then specialists can help out i am not proficient in biology , for example , but my experience , current research and our investigation of natural killer cells leads me to theorize that these cells which are on the lookout for newly developing cancer cells , are heavily affected by experience we find that they work in see saw fashion with levels of cortisol when we reduce cortisol levels in patients , natural killer cells are enhanced we can add this or reduce that but we cannot understand the whole problem without a field theory otherwise , we will only find what we are narrowly looking for , and no more another example , we learn that telomere cells respond directly to cortisol levels the lower the resting cortisol level the longer the telomere cells since this length may explain how long we may live , it is crucial to investigate it within a field theory otherwise we learn a great deal about telomeres and the research is important but not about how the psychologic experiential affects it all all aspects of experience are in play in our bodies at all times we can abstract them for study but it is still an abstraction
