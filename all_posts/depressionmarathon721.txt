i may be a little light in the wallet furnace , truck , health insurance , and i may feel like i got smacked in the face root canal , but the past few days have been better days i'm functioning and moving forward my mood has taken a bit of a hit with all the stress i 've recently encountered , but right now i'm riding it out okay i feel a little low and a lot lazy i did run my miles today , but now i can barely move it 's part muscle fatigue but larger part inertia i just want to lie in bed and sleep now puck wo n't allow more sleep , though he figured a two hour nap was plenty , thank you very much ! i needed that nap now i do n't know what else to do i 've got plenty i could be doing , but inertia sort of gets in the way of that life moves on whether we participate or not , and right now i'm counting on that i think i need the structure of work to cure my inertia until then , i 've really got no plans this little lull will pass i'm not panicking i'm not worried i sort of expected a crash after all of the recent stressors and this is hardly a crash it 's more like a slow motion thud i 'll let you know when i get moving again carry on , friends
