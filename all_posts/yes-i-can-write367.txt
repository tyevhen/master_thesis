it may be april fools day , but i'm not celebrating it what i am doing is feeling slightly overwhelmed like the world is dying , and i'm sitting on my computer , thinking , making plans for all the good for the world things i plan to do , yet actually doing nothing i feel like it 's myself and a few other people against the whole rest of the human population those who 've seen the truth , and those who seemingly never will but a friend who feels similarly sent me a couple of quotes , both of which made me , if not happy , then at least happier i found the first one resonated particularly well with me , although i love both ! here s to the crazy ones the misfits the rebels the troublemakers the round heads in the square holes the ones who see things differently they re not fond of rules and they have no respect for the status quo you can quote them , disagree with them , glorify them , or vilify them but the only thing you can t do is ignore them because they change things they push the human race forward and some may see them as the crazy ones , we see genius because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do jack kerouac never doubt that a small group of thoughtful , committed citizens can change the world indeed , it is the only thing that ever has margaret mead so here 's to a revolution , both of thought and in the physical world perhaps a small group of people really can change the world i sure hope so ! peace , idzie you might also like awesome revolutionary quotes quotes , quotes , and more quotes ! green anarchy anti civilization , and what that means linkwithin
