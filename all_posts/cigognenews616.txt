i have explained how the three levels of consciousness work we now know how resonance operates so let s put them together and see what we get you know how someone just talks and talks and dumps on us they cannot seem to stop themselves that is largely due to resonance , where the first line is close to consciousness and continually drives the release of a torrent of words in short , in the same way that in sex , when it gets to a certain heated level , it is hijacked by pain on the first line and then it is driven to its denouement by that deep level so when there is an argument the other person who is screaming and railing cannot seem to stop himself because the energy behind it lies on the most primitive areas of our nervous system the person is out of control because thoughts and desires do nothing to stop the onslaught from below in other words , here again , the first line hijacks the verbal area and drives it incessantly that torrent of emotions and words tells us about origins something that cognitive approaches cannot touch while we are encouraging control , the first line is arguing very well against control the current heated dialogue has dredged up very early pure energy from the preverbal non verbal brain that drives the interchange constantly so we might say , well that is pre psychotic but it is just the deep level imprints waiting for their exit when the current emotional level equals the deeper valences , there will be resonance , no matter how much we don t want it to happen and there will be hijacking in many areas in sex , once there is hijacking the act will run off exactly in terms of the first line it will take control and run the show so when someone seems out of control , you can count on resonance to be the culprit
