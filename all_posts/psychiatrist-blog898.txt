jill of all trades , md is a family physician blogger who has a post on kevinmd titled why answering a cell phone during an office visit is a problem she writes from the perspective of a primary care doc , and talks about the awkwardness of patients talking on the phone during their office visits she talks about it with a detective spy metaphor me your recent lab test shows that your diabetes is currently not sufficiently controlled with the current regimen your hemoglobin ac , which is a lab test that tells me what your sugar level has been at home for the past three months , is we need to add a medication at this point because riiinnnggg ! ! , a quite startling sound lifts me off my seat , as if signaling a new secret agent assignment patient oh , doctor , hold on one minute please is this a conspiracy ? before i can even respond , she picks up the cell phone and starts talking to this rather shady intruder patient hi , honey i m at the doctor s office what do you need ? i wait about thirty seconds , with what seems like an eternity in the secret agent world , and she is still on the phone with this suspicious invader at this point , i decide to exit the premises for some people , answering the phone immediately seems to be a bit of a compulsion and for someone who 's waited a long time to see an over booked doctor , i can see why they might want to take a call maybe it 's a call that was prearranged for a time long after the patient thought they 'd be free but the patient was surprised to find the doctor was running late , and so why should they put someone on hold for a doctor who 's kept them waiting ? why is it a one way street ? oh , because it is in psychotherapy it 's a different story people pay for time by the chunk and there are n't patients backed up waiting to fit into the same time slot i feel like it 's the patient 's time , and i do n't feel like i should say to an anxious mother , do n't take that call still , i'm always a bit surprised when people feel the need to take non urgent calls during an appointment , and to talk for a bit i feel a little uncomfortable listening and even for those who quickly say , i'm with the doctor , i 'll call you back , i'm not sure what that gains over having the phone off does my phone ring during sessions ? yes , because sometimes i forget to turn it off and if it rings , i reach over and silence it do i answer it during a session ? never whatever it is waits until the session is over the only exception i make is if i'm trying to get in touch with another physician regarding the care of the patient i'm seeing during that block of time i let people talk on the phone or text or deal with their families or clients no one has done it repeatedly or in a way that notably distracts from therapy i'm a bit surprised when anyone wants to pay my fee to talk on the phone , or even when anyone runs late , but hey if i were n't rented out in blocks of time , so to speak , i 'd be exiting with dr jill of all trades whenever the phone rang and on a completely different note , i noticed that jill of all trades has a link on her sidebar to shrink rapping i clicked on it thinking it would be us but , no there 's another shrink rapping doc out there dr gregory smith from georgia and he 's been at it a while how 'd we miss that ?
