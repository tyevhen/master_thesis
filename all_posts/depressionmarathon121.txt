i'm surprised it 's been nearly a week since i last wrote maybe it 's because my last post is still relevant today i 've had a decent week at least there have been no big dramas with regards to work , or my teeth , or running this week it 's been a decent week i'm plugging along as happened last week , some things have gone okay , some things not so much my mood has been in the latter category i barely got out of my house at least a couple of mornings this week i so , so wanted to call in sick , but i was n't sick i was heavy , and empty , and hopeless , but i was n't sick i did n't want to go , but i knew if i stayed home i would only feel worse letting depression control my actions always has that effect , and i did n't want to allow that besides , patients and co workers were counting on me to show up , and that 's important to me so i went to work i knew getting to work would likely help me feel better , and it did work went well despite my mood i may have been a little less patient , and was probably a little irritable at times , but i always felt better at the end of the day than i did when i arrived working with others , helping others , forced me to shift my focus outside myself if i had stayed home , i would have had my focus all to myself that certainly would n't have helped i'm glad i made it to work i'm also glad i was able to run this week , again despite my mood i had to take a nap before every run in order to summon the energy to go , but go i did i ran monday , tuesday , and thursday and then today , i ran long in fact , jet and i ran miles today i was really tired when i finished , but i'm so glad i was able to get it done i did have a scare in my th mile , as my right achilles began to hurt it happened suddenly i took a step , and it hurt concerned , well scared , i slowed down to a walk immediately i prayed , out loud , to god please give me a break ! i was miles from home , so after a minute i began slowly jogging again it hurt for another minute or so , and then it stopped i was okay for the rest of my run i 've iced it and rested it , and it 's still okay i'm so grateful i 'll be back on the elliptigo tomorrow or maybe i 'll be back in the woods tomorrow i feel like i may need to do something different , like maybe that will help my mood , so i may go for a long hike in the woods tomorrow rather than ride my elliptigo it 's supposed to be a beautiful day maybe i 'll go to a nearby state park and explore some of the trails jet and i did n't get to on our last hike the woods usually help my mood , and spending time with jet is always good after that , and a good nap , i 'll keep plugging along into next week i wish i was feeling better , but i'm grateful my mood has n't gotten worse despite feeling low , very low at times , i 've been able to get done what i 've needed to get done i'm also grateful for that depression has beaten me down a bit this week , but i'm still standing i take some comfort in and strength from that carry on , my friends
