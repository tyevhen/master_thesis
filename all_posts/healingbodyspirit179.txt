this is the question i was asked this morning patty 's answer i have recovered from chronic fatigue but was able to work just barely i had to take medical leave for several months after my last husband died my doctor wanted to give me medical disablity when he discovered i had cfids because i was so ill , but i would n't take it most days i felt like i had the drop dead flu my husband was seriously ill and on dialysis and had no insurance i had to work , we needed the inusurance however , in reality i was too exhausted to work i do n't know how i did it i would go home and flop on the bed and not get up until morning when i had to drag myself out of bed i slept all weekend i could never accept that i would have chronic fatigue forever i had to find a way to get better i went from doctor to doctor , prayed and prayed , and finally found a doctor who discovered i had candida that was the beginning of my recovery other older blogs explains a little bit about how i recovered going to work everyday was like beating a dead horse or dragging one behind me there was no hurry in me still , i was a school counselor and could sit down and counsel students if i was talking to a teacher or student in the hall , i would lean against the wall summers were my refuge , but they were not long enough
