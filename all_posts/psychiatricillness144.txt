work has been a real nightmare , i am so busy i am working every hour i can , i do n't have any clean clothes , i have just done the washing up after days of leaving it , i am living on takeaways and starting to feel my grip going i have not even thought about christmas and have had to cancel my time off work next week i thought , i know , i will ask my mum to come and stay either this week or next , just for a few days until i am back on top ! just to help me out for a day or two , my mum and sister are always saying they are here for me and let them know when if i need them but rather than her helping the first time i have ever asked after two and a half years she cancels the one day she was going to come and help me get a christmas tree i'm thinking of cancelling christmas this year ! i ca n't cope and all i get is hassle it even seems like a hassle to receive presents , my sister wanted to know exaclty which colour and make of lounge suit to get me , in the end i said forget it get me slippers she was getting annoyed that i would not go into shops and try them on , i have not had time now she is emailing me pictures of slippers if i go quiet and need a rest and want to be left alone they ring me times a day the first time i have ever asked for help not only does my mum say no but she cancels the one day she was going to come anyway this is when i need the help , i have a career i love and i am having to choose between managing my illness and my career i ca n't go on sleeping hours a day and working hours a day if i only slept or like everyone else i could work hours and keep on top of looking after myself this is not fair ! ! it is times like these i feel most alone ! ! ! ! the people i work with are lovely but i do n't want to tell anyone why i am strugling my boss is the only one who knows my history and he is off on holiday that leaves my business partners and i really do n't want them to know
