what has this to do with self destruction , as some therapies describe the suicide attempt ? i was discussing the difference between self destructive behavior and suicide with a colleague they are quite different , although you would think that suicide is destruction of the self , but it is not at all like that let s take literal destruction , cutting oneself this is a later ploy , making hurt obvious it is a plea for help please see my hurt see that i hurt this in lieu of screaming out that hurt and the cutter is not often aware of what she is doing or why it was never acknowledged by anyone because perhaps the parents had no idea of that hurt or even that such emotional hurt existed there are many aspects of this her feeling was , i m trying to let the hurt escape , even when she had no idea what it was she just knew it was inside and it had to come out another woman , a self cutter told me that she cut because it took away some of the emotional hurt which was more painful it had a beginning and an end it was controllable whereas the emotional hurt just kept going on she found out that it was exactly what we do letting pain out but in methodical ways so she no longer had to cut herself the feeling has to be felt deeply to match the force of the pain involved the patient is trying to let the pain out in the only way she can make it visible and palpable if you can at least see it there is something you can do about it when there are later circumstances of neglect and lack of love , the deep imprints become compounded and cemented in those later traumas lack of love increase the repression and force unconscious acting out , such as cutting oneself , to try to get at the source , hopefully , yet unconsciously but suicide is still a long way off it is amazing how so often people cut themselves , unwittingly digging out the source of their suffering without even knowing what they are doing suicide , then , is a deeper , earlier sensation feeling with no behavioral possibilities they are , indeed , two different things even though suicide attempts to destroy the self it is not , oddly , self destructive and of course , self destructiveness it ramifies so that the destructive behavior takes on many forms , such as sabotaging one s own success or always picking toxic partners but it is not as direct as suicide suicide means one final act it is not anything in the present that causes it it is the result of a deep memory there are myriad examples of self destructive behavior , but all the manifestations come from subdued feelings there are people who set themselves up for certain failure , who always make sure things turn out bad , who drink themselves into oblivion or who repeatedly get involved with a low lifes they know are bad for them here the driving forces are nearly always deep seeded pain these are secondary effects of imprinted hurt driving with drunk drivers is a good example another is the case of a graduate student who could not get feedback from his professors for a paper he had turned in after weeks of trying to get through he sent a most nasty letter to the instructor for that , he was delayed in getting his degree so he shot himself in the foot because he could never get through to his father and also because he literally couldn t get through in being born being blocked from getting what he wanted and needed had set off a rage in him , and as we know rage is first line , brainstem originated it is the seat of the most atavistic anger possible he was helpless before this surge of fury resonance reached down and dredged it all up , surging upwards beyond control he knew when he sent the letter it was wrong this is what used to be called emotional his emotions got the best of him they weren t irrational they were real but buried deeply the relief of reliving in primal therapy , we seek access to those deep recesses of the brain , where ultimate healing lies first line is always more powerful than later imprints and they are the most healing , offering up many insights that previous behavior was based on the insights that flow from first line feelings are widely encompassing because they are the basis for so much later behavior reliving on the brainstem level means complete connection as the driving force of impulses are experienced at last we connect , in short , on the level of the trauma and in that context only here we are dealing with the shark brain no shouts , no wild movements evolution has taken over it means the patient has gone back in time and is living again what went on decades before then it was too overwhelming for a na ve and fragile infant brain to integrate now , perhaps , he is ready for it that is the true meaning of facing yourself and accepting yourself not in the booga booga , new age sense but in the biologic evolutionary meaning of it , where the feeling is now integrated into the physical system it becomes ego syntonic that is the real meaning of becoming oneself as the reliving goes on , the feeling is fully integrated and there is a continued drop in vital signs and body temperature lowers to real normal , rather than average normal in this sense , integration is a new biologic state where the whole system can re regulate itself normalization has set in and depression bids adieu and no one has done anything outside the body it all originated from inside that is why i say that everything the patient has to learn is already inside , waiting in primal therapy , we get patients gradually down to those deep feelings that are so disturbing and once those feelings are resolved and brought to consciousness , there are no more thoughts of suicide why ? because there are no more buried feelings driving the suicidal thoughts it takes time , but when they get there , they discover real relief , the kind that lasts and lets them live
