i cannot say enough about how wonderful my wife is she is thoughtful , caring , supportive , understanding and always there for me when my ego was greater than my physical capabilities , she paid the price by nursing me back to health whenever i had a serious injury , my wife was the one that had to change her life to accommodate my needs she has given up so much to care for me besides the sacrifices she makes for me , she also has to put up with my stubbornness , frustrations , and ill temper yes , for those who know me i know it is hard to believe that i could be any of these things it is not her fault that i can no longer do certain things it is not her fault that i am a little impatient just a little yet , she is the one that has to listen to my outbursts of anger and complaints when i become frustrated i swear that no one , but someone who really loves me , would put up with all my crap my apologies and thankfulness seems to be a rather feeble attempt to acknowledge all that she puts up with and sacrifices for me you would think i would learn to tone it down just a little ! anyway , i cannot say enough about how wonder my caregiver is she should be nominated for sainthood
