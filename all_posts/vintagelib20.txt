to continue on the theme of wednesday 's post and to keep it brief to avoid extra negativity on my part this is how my abdomen has felt for the past two days worst bloating of my entire life i will be back with fun dresses and informative posts as soon as my belly decides to be nice to me again ca n't blog when all i want to do is hug a water bottle and not move lest all my organs feel like they are being squished and pinched it also makes me walk like an year old bright side somehow i can work with bloating better than i can with cramping bloating is super painful when i move or hold on too long but if i just sit in one spot with a heat pack i can usually manage to distract myself effectively enough at work you might also like pms counting the little things and the big things ! day my favourite endo blogs shireen 's story heather 's story linkwithin
