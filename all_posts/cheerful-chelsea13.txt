a hearty hello to you all , i know it 's been a while since i lasted posted as i explained in my last post i was having a difficult time after the death of a beloved pet , if you did n't see the post i have linked it here for you to read i 've had a break from both of my blogs as i needed some time to adjust without having the little critter around , that and his little home was in my office so the space left in his wake has been enormous and i have n't wanted to face that room for a while since my last post i 've been regaining some control over my life i say some as it seems as if i have a fair few things hovering beyond my grasp and i ca n't reach out and grab them all at the same time ! i 've been seeing an acupuncture therapist for a few months now which has been incredible for me just having somewhere else to go during the day is nice and i 've established a good relationship with tracey who presses needles into me like a pin cushion for one hour a week i 'll talk more about that in a future post so if you have any questions about acupuncture please send them to my e mail cheerfulchelsea outlook com or comment below and i 'll answer them in that blog post after a couple of acupuncture appointments in which i have a minute talk through the previous week 's activities , highs and lows , i started to feel more comfortable with the idea of seeing a counsellor again i 've had some pretty horrendous experiences with health care professionals from various departments including counsellors i was n't sure if i 'd be able to trust someone in that way again after having my words twisted back on me which made me feel worse than ever and guilty about everything i had disclosed to them seeing tracey and becoming so comfortable with her made me realise there are genuinely nice people out there who want to listen and help , it 's not just about getting paid at the end of the hour ! i 'll also be writing another post on how i found my new counsellor and how the experience feels so different this time finally , i 've been getting on top of my physical health problems of which there are many ! it 's hard to believe that i am only years old some times as i feel pretty rusty , broken down and generally in need of a full service and oil change ! i 've had a bit more energy since i 've kick started my sleeping pattern with the help of magnesium supplements as a result i 've finally felt able to start exercising again i often discredit myself for the amount of exercise i get just from walking toby every day , but i have n't felt properly fit or comfortable in my skin for so many years now it 's the classic case of summer is coming and i'm not ready for it i do n't think of it as getting bikini body ready because that is applicable all year round , you 've got a body , get a bikini and bam done for me it 's about not wanting to have another summer come around only for me to feel uncomfortable , wanting to hibernate and chuck on some winter clothes to cover every inch of my body and wondering why i did n't make some changes sooner it seems as if taking some time off can be good for the blog ! i 've got a lot to write about , a lot to share and hopefully some of it will help someone else i'm also working up the courage to start filming videos i think the majority will be beauty based however , i have a few ideas for some videos that could help the readers of this blog some will be me recounting things i 've already discussed on the blog sometimes people struggle to read long pieces of text and take in details , particularly when they are depressed so hearing those words being spoken and seeing someone they could relate to could be beneficial to them i 'll also produce some videos on things i have n't discussed before my real aim is to show you that there is a real person behind this blog , that you can trust and confide in me if you wish much in the same way as this blog , you will only see what i allow you to see through videos , you still do n't get the entire story or what someone is really going through when you only see a small viewfinder of them and their life anyway , i think it will be beneficial for me too , being able to flex my creative muscles in a new way through producing and editing videos no matter how many breaks i take from the blog i hope you all know that i 'll always return to it , the exception being if i fall out of love with writing i ca n't see that happening any time soon in the last post i disclosed that i 've been working on something big i do n't want to jump the gun so lets just say it 's an extended piece of writing that i 've been working on for over a year
