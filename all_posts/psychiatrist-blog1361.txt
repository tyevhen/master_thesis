the usual discussion revolves around whether those who seek treatment for mental disorders should be called patients or clients so roy and i were at a legislative mental health meeting and one of the people giving testimony kept referring to psychiatric patients as consumers consumers ? okay , it 's not the first time i 've heard the term , but here it was used over and over and over again consumers i suppose i think of myself as a psychiatrist who treats patients , and not as a 'provider' to 'consumers ' this meeting took place around the same time that one of our readers commented it was insulting when i referred to a patient with recent and repeated episodes of dangerous behavior as a time bomb after she stopped her medications precipitously i was thinking about the power of language , the innuendo of words and phrases , and i was struck by the repeated reference to consumers it brings to mind , for me , this odd anxiety that my patients will eat me alive does n't one consume food or fuel ? does one consume psychiatric services ? what exactly does one consume during a psychotherapy session ? what 's there at the beginning that 's gone by the end ? can someone please tell me why anyone would want to be a consumer rather than simply a patient ? please do n't pass the ketchup oh , and my graphic of the person eating lobster is in honor of roy 's vacation posts from maine please , please , do consume one for me
