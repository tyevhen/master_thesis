i bought a copy of manic depressive illness when it first came out in one of the more interesting aspects of the book was the commentary on the use of lithium monotherapy for unipolar depression that discussion is limited to about three pages and reviewed the work to date in the opening paragraph there is this astonishing line overall , the result of open studies suggest that lithium is as effective in preventing unipolar illness as it is in preventing bipolar illness at the time there were controlled studies looking at the issue of maintenance therapy in mixed unipolar and bipolar groups three of the four studies showed no difference between groups the fourth study was inconlusive due to a high dropout rate subsequent analyses by schou and baldessarini and tohen concluded that the protective effects of lithium in preventing recurrent depressive episodes was good in schou 's reanalysis he showed that the relapse rate in one year on lithium for unipolar depression was compared with a relapse rate for bipolar disorder and the rates for antidepressants at one year were for unipolar depression and for bipolar disorder relative to placebo of relapse rate since that early open research there has been only randomized controlled clinical trial rct of lithium versus placebo antidepressant augmentation in that study patients treated with placebo relapsed and one suicided in the lithium treated group relapsed the authors recommended that patients who respond to lithium augmentation be maintained on it for at least months additional clinical parameters of interest in the treated group was an average lithium dose of mg , an average li level of mmol l , and a response time of days in acute treatment this is interesting because many psychiatrists using lithium augmentation were taught to stop at mg day and accept the associated lower levels my point in the introductory paragraph here is that it has been known for some time that lithium may have a role in maintenance of unipolar depression in addition to bipolar depression even though it is hardly ever used that way int he united states in the us , patients typically endure a long series of antidepressant trials or augmentation strategies if the initial trails are ineffective there is always the problems of whether the antidepressant has lost its effect or not and the associated difficulty of trying to determine what other factors may be operative lithium has been used for the past three decades as an augmenting agent added to antidepressants typically a lower dose is used mg day and that may offer a lower chance of toxicity and less need for monitoring blood levels against this backdrop , a very interesting paper by tiihonen , et al came out last year for reasons that will follow , i consider this to be one of the most important papers for clinical psychiatrists from the authors provide a sound rationale for their study , specifically the advantages of a large scale epidemiological observational study over an rct or the cochrane meta analysis of rcts that meta analysis like most cochrane meta analyses concluded that the number of subjects included was too small to come to a statistically significant conclusion the study was conducted in finland the authors point out that each citizen has a unique identifier that facilitates the design of large inclusive observational studies across health care databases the sample in this case was a study cohort n , of patients who had been admitted to a hospital for unipolar depression between january , and december , they had a comparison incident cohort n that looked at new patients beginning on december , with no mental health diagnosis , hospital admissions for depression , exposure to the medications of interest , or history of outpatient care in the year prior to the start the purpose of the incident cohort was to look at the issue of survival bias the primary outcome measure was risk of readmission in all patients admitted for unipolar depression at least once between and all cause admissions were a secondary outcome measure medication use was estimated using the predup mathematical modelling of the patient medication purchasing each patient was used as their own control to eliminate selection bias i did not have access to the appendices from this study , so i will forgo further discussion of the statistical methodology without that data mean hospitalizations for people who had used lithium was sd for psychiatric admission and sd for all cause admissions compared to sd and sd for those who had not indicating the lithium treated patient were more severely ill using lithium significantly decreased the relapse risk mean daily lithium dose was noted to be mg forest plots are contained in the body of the article looking at the hazard rations of readmission for several pharmacological treatments in both the study cohort and the incident cohort forest plots looked at benzodiazepines , hypnotics , antipsychotics , and lithium antidepressants lithium monotherapy was superior to all other studied pharmacotherapies in preventing hospital readmissions older antidepressants amitriptyline and doxepin and antipsychotics clozapine sulpride , aripiprazole , and quetiapine showed some efficacy in preventing hosptializations benzodiazepines did not in the incident cohort where survival bias was eliminated the lithium effect on decreased rehospitalizations was more robust suggesting the effect size was more valid than for the total cohort they also did a secondary mortality assessment and showed that both lithium and antidepressants were associated with decreased overall mortality and no difference was observed for antipsychotics the authors recognize that there are significant adverse effects and limitations with the use of lithium they point out there are also possible advantages outside the treatment of mood disorders but there is a significant burden associated with taking it they recommend that is be considered for maintenance of a broader group of patients with unipolar depression in our antidepressant centric society , i agree with their conclusion the effects in this study really cannot be ignored lithium augmentation of antidepressants has been around for over years it surfaced again the the star d protocol i see patients who have been exclusively been treated by other physicians or prescribers and in the past years i have seen exactly patient with unipolar depression who was being treated with lithium augmentation it is far more common to see patient taking antidepressants typically ssri bupropion trazodone or mirtazapine or an antidepressant plus lamotrigine as the augmentation strategy a similar study with a cohort of american patients would be very useful to look at questions about the efficacy of lithium versus the antidepressant polypharmacy or lamotrigine but my concern would be that there would not be a large enough sample of patients taking lithium it may be up to clinicians who are used to lithium therapy and the application to unipolar depression to reintroduce the practice and collect data on what the outcomes are relative to standard antidepressant augmentation strategies overall this study from a group of pharmacoepidemiologists provides compelling data to take a second look at an old strategy instead of just adding more antidepressants the data looks so good , lithium is so inexpensive , and in the usa we are in an absolute vacuum of lithium non use for unipolar depression inpatient treatment for depression has become so atrocious that it has never been more important to help people stay out of the hospital that is why i considered this to be an
