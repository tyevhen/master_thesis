i'm on my way north to the triathlon my brothers and i are teaming up for a relay my youngest brother was a state qualifying swimmer in multiple events , so he 's obviously doing the swimming miles portion i'm the only one with a bike , so that 's my responsibility miles and my other brother was an awesome runner not sure how he 's doing these days so he 's running miles the last leg we 're entered into the silver division that means we 're old ! it should be fun , and i'm really looking forward to it it 's been a long time since my brothers and i teamed up in anything in fact , it 's probably been since little league baseball since we 've done any sporting activity together ! we 're not the closest family , and being the only girl of four siblings , i often end up feeling isolated from the guys so this is actually kind of special i hope it goes well i think we may have a good chance of placing , but i'm going to focus on having fun and spending quality time with my brothers it will also be nice to be back up in my home area i'm from the most beautiful part of minnesota in my humble opinion , and i miss it terribly i almost always feel peaceful when i'm up there peace may be harder to come by on this trip , as i'm staying with my brother 's family two young , very active children in a small space does not always lend itself to peaceful moments hopefully , i 'll be able to get away for just a bit to gather my head if i can do that , this will be a particularly good trip wish me luck ! i 'll let you know how everything turns out
