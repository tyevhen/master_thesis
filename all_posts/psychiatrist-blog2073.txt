i went out to lunch today at a restaurant that specializes in organic , fair trade , allergen free , dolphin safe food while i was waiting i browsed the brochures , business flyers and cards that people left in the lobby i found pretty much what i expected to see in a place with organic , fair trade , allergen free , dolphin safe food business cards for accupuncturists , chinese herbalists , shiatsu , yoga and feng shui then i came across one that stopped me in my tracks it was an advertisement for are you ready angel adjustment the flyer made a point of noting that angel adjustment was trademarked intellectual property , and that it was designed to promote general wellbeing it was offered in collaboration with dr x , phd did n't mention what the field phd was in and the cost ? only for a half hour , or for an hour and i did n't even know that angels needed adjusting , which just goes to show what they teach you in medical school and maybe i should demand my money back in medical school they should teach you about the etiology , diagnosis , treatment and prognosis of maladjusted angels after all , they make you memorize the krebs cycle and as far as i'm aware that 's got nothing to do whatsoever with my spiritual well being then there was the brochure for the spiritual garden consultant , only per half hour now , if the state of your garden reflects your spiritual wellbeing then i am in seriously deep do do if that 's the case i do n't need a lawn care guy , i need an exorcist when i go into any kind of home and garden store , i get an inverse humane society reaction at the humane society the lonely lost and abandoned puppies and kittens run up to you and cry and whimper for attention at the home and garden store budding rose bushes scream and plead for their lives like i'm the next coming of saddam hussein now there 's a guy with seriously maladjusted angels then again , i'm not really trained to diagnose that
