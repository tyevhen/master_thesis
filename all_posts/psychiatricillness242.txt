i met him , it did not exactly go to plan and i did originally stood him up again but i went back i originally got there a few minutes late but i had received a text message that he was trying to park i waited there for about mins i was doing fine , nervous but managing to keep myself reasonably calm i was in control i even spoke to him on the phone and although my stomach was all in knots when i answered it i was still doing well then i saw someone walking along and i thought it might have been him so i got up to walk towards him but it was not the right person therefore i stood looking around me and waiting that was the big mistake , as soon as i saw someone on the phone and my phone started to ring i just went i almost ran to get out of there ! i felt really really awful ! i had stood him up twice the first time was a few weeks ago when he was late and i wound myself up while i was waiting until i just decided it was not worth the hassle i turned my phone off and went home i felt really bad about it , so bad i did not turn my phone on to face the messages for over a week i did a lot better this time , i still acted very weirdly but better than last time i could not do this to him again , so i sent him a text message saying i was not going to meet him we swapped a few more text messages i was going to get a sandwich and go home but then i could not stay in the town incase he saw me and recognised me so i got in the car and drove to mc donolds in the retail park i munched my way through a large meal as i was comfort eating , i did not enjoy it at all i then got in the car to drive home , i was telling myself that i had pushed myself too hard and making the decision to take smaller steps in future i was just starting to feel better inside when i had a message to say he would stay in town for a few hours he had come a long way and i had stood him up twice even after promising i would not today therefore i made a plan to just go in to town and have a hot chocalate i mean leaving town incase i bumped into him is extreme avoidance i just took it one step at the time , queueing for the car park , parking , going to the coffee shop , ordering a drink and sitting down i then sent him a text saying where i was and that he could come and say hello if he still wanted to i probably only saw him for minutes if that but i really felt like i had achieved something he has been so patient and really nice and understanding he did nothing to increase my anxiety ! x , if you read this thank you ! ! ! i must get on and do some ironing and packing for tomorrow , i have to go round to my friends to take some house plants for her to look after and check in for my flight on line i can not do it here as i do not have a printer to print the boarding pass
