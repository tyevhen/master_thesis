just a quick note sometimes readers leave very passionate comments that have coarse language when i used blogger 's comment system before , i could put up a warning that nsfw language and comments would result in getting your comments deleted i wanted to keep my blog and comments safe for work and family now that i use disqus , i ca n't put up a warning fortunately , they automatically flag comments with coarse language for moderation that means your comments wo n't even be posted until i approve them i encourage you to express yourself fully , then go back and snip out the naughty bits so your comments get posted immediately for everyone to enjoy lately , i 've been using disqus' system to edit the flagged comments and mark out nsfw parts because i liked what the readers shared with luck this wo n't be a problem for you in the future i 'll check with disqus to see if there is a way to post a warning above the comment box , but until then , please consider yourself warned i want everyone to have a voice , but i also want everyone to feel comfortable in my comments section thank you for your support d you might also like is it supposed to do that ? i'm in the top add blog list ? is there some mistake ? moving bits bytes what do i have in common with the top adhd blogs ? linkwithin
