every day ca n't be a great day that 's what the song said i turned up the radio , laughed ironically , and continued my afternoon drive home today was certainly not a great day it was an overwhelming and stressful day , but it was definitely not a great day actually , it 's been a tough hours it started with the big truck repair yesterday a repair so big it lasted until this afternoon then last night , my furnace shut off again i had no heat despite paying for a repair just five days ago ! that made today , a day when i got a new patient , quite rushed , as i needed to make time to pick up my truck and to wait at home for the furnace repairman starting a patient can take up to hours all of a sudden i felt like i needed to be in three places at once so i rushed i rushed as professionally as possible through my patients i left my paperwork undone until i got home , and i did it while i waited for the repairman i freaked out when the repairman informed me i likely needed another part in order to fix the furnace i do n't have extra dollars , so i told him i 'd wait to see what happened perhaps , miraculously , it wo n't break down again is that another ironic laugh i hear ? after the repairman left i rushed off to the mechanic a minute drive each way in order to pick up my truck before they closed that 's where i received my first bit of good news i did n't need new brakes after all so instead of a repair , i only had to spend ! insert another ironic laugh here spending all of this money , money i do n't feel i have to spend , makes me very anxious tomorrow is my root canal repair surgery i'm anxious about that , too i have tomorrow 's visit paid for , but i'm worried i may need more than one visit i have an infection in the root of the tooth , and if the infection is too severe , the endodontist wo n't be able to repair it in one visit more pain , more time , more money today was one of those days it did n't begin favorably , and it did n't improve much throughout the day to make matters worse , i 've been eating crap for three days i think i crave crap when i'm stressed cookies ! ! eating cookies , and cake , and ice cream does nothing to improve my anxiety state it only makes things worse mentally and physically and making myself feel worse is really the last thing i need ! so i 've got to turn this thing around it 's getting harder and harder for me to believe it will all work out , but i have to get back my faith it will all work out i may not like it i do n't it may not be easy it is n't but eventually it will all work out i have to believe that i have to believe that , or life will only get more difficult right now , life 's overwhelming and stressful , and i do n't like it very much but hey , every day ca n't be a great day and tomorrow 's got to be better
