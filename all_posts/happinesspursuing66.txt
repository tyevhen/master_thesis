that last post was so silly and pitiful i thought that i 'd give the wort another try today is only the second day if i have another giddy fit i 'll just have to push through it spring is charging towards my part of the world every year i have this feeling that i'm ill equipped to deal with it previously i just thought that i was overwhelmed by the happy season now i have the depression excuse nothing like a good excuse , eh ? perhaps the wort will help me enjoy it without giving me the feeling that i'm supposed to do something about it i do n't mind that feeling until it replaces pleasure and i'm left with nagging self doubt that 's not what i mean
