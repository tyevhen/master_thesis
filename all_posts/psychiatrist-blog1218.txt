a reader wrote in the following at least with pediatric psychiatry , the shrinks really do n't know how bad it is or how much stress is on the family or the other kids caring for violent , manic , agitated kids at home actually , when i initially read the comment , i thought it said the kiddy shrinks do n't really care how bad it is as i 've re read it , i realize it 's a more accurate portrayal the shrinks do n't know how bad it is oh , if it 's okay , i'm going to springboard off the do n't care how bad it is it 's likely quite true that the docs do n't know how bad it is it is a regular sentiment , however , that people feel their docs do n't care i'm always perplexed by that because caring is an internal emotion , how do you know if someone cares ? you could ask hey do you care that i'm miserable ? oh , of course , the answer will be yes maybe a doc cares but does n't quite know what to do , and feels internally squirmy at the inability to fix a patient 's suffering maybe the patient has a low key personality style and does n't adequately convey that they are suffering one can say they are tormented , but if they say it wedged in between a discussion of ncaa pics while they are knitting , sometimes the tenor of the suffering is attenuated and one can scream and rant and rave about their suffering , but if they 've screamed and ranted and raved about the poor service in a restaurant , well , there 's that whole crying sheep issue that makes it hard to filter it 's not that docs do n't care , it 's that there is some professional distance and if the kiddy shrink has lived through the same exact nightmare , he may or may not state this out load there 's an unpredictable element of trade off in the perception the patient 's family might have i'm so glad you know exactly what i 've been through and it 's comforting to have this kind of empathy your experiences color your ability to see clearly all the possible options and you 're too caught up in your own kid 's issues to fully appreciate my kid 's issues , or you 've screwed up your kid , why do i want you near my kid ? i 've used the kid example because our reader provided it , but it could just as easily be a case of pneumonia yours got better in days so you ca n't appreciate that i'm still sick months later some of what comes off as caring is n't really about caring at all , it 's about the doctor 's external display of concern some peeps are pretty reserved they can be distraught , eaten up inside , thinking about a patient 's problem , going home and reading about , calling friends for ideas , and still not convey this to the patient they can look uncaring and cavalier another doc can jump up and down and seem very concerned , but not actually change anything or do anything in medical school , i had a brief period where i got eaten up by other people 's problems the summer after my first year , i did a rotation in a psychiatric unit with some more advanced medical students it was a very psychoanalytically oriented staff and we constantly being asked to process what had happened on the units , how we felt about things , and for weeks it seemed we were being asked how we felt about leaving there was a suicide in the hospital , there was a long term meaning years patient there who was being treated for borderline personality disorder , and she kept lighting fires the drama was non stop , the emotions were intense by the end of the summer , i was n't sure i should be a psychiatrist , not because i did n't like it , but because i was emotionally over involved it got better medicine as a whole , requires some distance you want your doctor to care enough to hear your pain , to address it , to explore a variety of treatment options , but you do n't really need , or perhaps even want , your doctor to feel your pain and my guess is that our reader is correct that the doctors do n't really know how bad it can be note to retriever may i use your entire comment as a free standing guest post ? ? it was a good synopsis of some of the policy problems behind the mental health system
