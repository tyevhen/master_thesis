photo by renee w friday night was an all around huge success i am feeling so proud of myself for preparing so well i was able to concentrate during dinner on just eating what i wanted and thats exactly what i did we had tacos and i ate one soft taco which was really good and then i was content so i stopped and no one said anything about it i was able to enjoy and participate in the conversation and never had to focus on my breathing or positive affirmations i think i was more comfortable than usual because i had told her before about my anxieties and so the pressure was off for trying to impress them and be perfect because the secret was already out i had so much fun we told funny stories and laughed and afterward went out to see a movie which i recommend , it was a good scary movie after the movie we left to go home but i had so much fun i wanted to hang out with them again as soon as possible its very cool that i was so calm and collected granted , i took a little clonozapam before i went and that might have helped but i'm okay with that i feel that this experience will help me in my goal to break out of the captive fear of caring about what others think it might be a slow crawl , the anxiety is still there , and some days are worse than others but this was a huge success for me i know that by writing it all out beforehand i was able to enter the phobic situation in a more relaxed state of mind which is what you are supposed to do before you expose yourself to your fears i am hoping that i can continue to document successful situations such as this so that they will outweigh the setbacks also the more success i have the more i can draw for proof to stop the overgeneralization that i will always have an attack in a certain situation i might have mentioned this already but its so much easier to remember the bad situations because they leave a harder impression in your mind the good times , the successes , are much harder to remember and so i want to remember this day , this feeling of pride and accomplishment and success photo by simon thanks to everyone 's love and support i really do appreciate it i get a gold star for the day you might also like much needed success a year later same scenario , different outcome be assertive ? finding beauty in the storm linkwithin
