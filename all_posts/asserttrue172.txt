last month , i wrote about why i think google will have to lay off as many as , employees in the coming year the bottom line being expenses are rising out of control , while google 's core business faces an uncertain future yahoo is in an even more precarious position before the year is out , marissa mayer will have no choice but to implement a serious reduction in force to use hr parlance either that , or the company will need to merge with aol and then suffer the headcount reduction before marissa mayer came in as ceo of yahoo , the company s annual ebitda earnings before interest , taxes , etc was billion , as of for this year , bloomberg estimates yahoo will produce billion in ebitda , a roughly drop in profitability since mayer took over in the same time frame , yahoo s revenues have dropped , from billion to an expected billion this , as facebook tripled its revenues and google increased its top line marissa mayer source ap eric jackson , writing at forbes com , found that after you strip away the various patent licensing deals and other special forms of income that have expiration dates on them , you find that yahoo 's core business is generating only million in ebitda , not billion so in other words , yahoo may be able to offer a rosy picture to the world for another quarter or two , but eventually the emperor 's robes come off and it 's pretty clear that none of marissa mayer 's acquisitions , nor the katie couric deal which is n't moving the needle for yahoo news traffic , nor any of mayer 's other failed initiatives , are suddenly going to rescue the company 's profitability to the tune of a billion dollars by year 's end jackson sees no alternative but a huge layoff given that yahoo with one third the revenue of facebook employs more people than facebook , it 's hard to disagree with jackson 's analysis he notes of course , i have long argued that yahoo s core business is obscenely over staffed not just a little , but a lot i agree with marc andreessen 's advice to marissa mayer back in that she should immediately let go of , people although yahoo reports in their k that they have , full time and fixed term contractors , they never state how many variable term contractors they employ yahoo has played this game long before mayer showed up as ceo , but she has carried on the tradition with a vengeance yahoo 's core problem , of course , is that it does n't have a core business it 's a crazy quilt of search , news , apps , e mail , and social nonsense , without a mission statement it 's the new aol which is why the two companies should merge maybe aol , which has grown its top line out of the last quarters without resorting to bizarre one off patent deals , can teach yahoo a thing or two about running a business just for fun , i ran a google trends search on yahoo , twitter , and instagram the trend lines show yahoo and twitter peaking in and , while instagram owned by facebook is uptrending nicely amazingly , and perhaps tellingly , out of analysts have a buy or strong buy rating for yahoo stock right now that alone is disconcerting when that many analysts line up behind what 's obviously a shaky stock , it makes me want to run for the exits analyst price targets range from to n analysts personally , i look for yhoo to go to and i 'd be a strong seller of it right here , right now , based on the information in jackson 's excellent forbes com piece and mayer 's track record of abject incompetence i 've made some improvements to my twitter timeline scraping code and can now thank even more people for retweeting me the following list of people who retweeted me yesterday might still not be complete , but it 's more complete than it would have been with my old code you should follow the folks shown below they retweet ! click their pictures the pics are live links if you enjoyed this post , wo n't you pass the link along on social media ? thanks ! meanwhile , have you added your name to our mailing list ? what the heck are you waiting for , a personal invitation from thetweetofgod ? also please visit hackyourdepression com when you have a chance , and share that link with someone you know who might be suffering from anxiety or depression
