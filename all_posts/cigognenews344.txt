as i have pointed out , the brain develops into three different systems i call them the first , second and third lines the first is brain stem and parts of the archaic limbic system , the second is basically limbic system , including the amygdala , hippocampus and other structures such as the anterior caudate nucleus each of these structures including the striatum contribute to our general feeling capacity they are connected to the top level prefrontal cortex to help us be aware of our feelings this is the area of insights and they are evolved out of the brainstem that provides the energy and gravity of feelings the first line is silent and wordless it grunts , exhibits rage , terror and great physical reactions that are never expressed in words that is why we need higher levels to provide those words when necessary but less us not believe that the cognitive level by itself can make any changes insights it misses out on the serious sensations that exist on the deepest brain levels so we have a basic primitive ineffable level , a higher emotional one and finally , a verbal one all together they form a fully feeling experience when we relive events from our childhood there is generally all levels involved there is the memory by the third line , then we add the emotion to it in therapy and then allow the punch of the feeling to join in when we relive events before birth , during gestation , it is a first line experience where there are no words or even tears when we read a speech too often we lack the emotional level it remains dry , cognitive and intellectual when are born we have most of the brain neurons we will ever need , except for some limbic brain cells that go on developing throughout our lives early on the brain is developing networks and circuits where different brain structures are connected to each other but lack of love and trauma during early childhood seriously affects how the brain develops and what networks there are the feeling system will recruit aspects of the limbic system into a feeling network except when there is little emotion in the environment , when the parents are two stones who do not react much it affects the brain development of the child the emotions become stunted the cognitive level may go on developing but it leaves the emotional level behind we get brainy people who don t feel much we know from much research that neglect in the first months of life on earth adversely affects brain development there are later learning problems and relating difficulties but picture the traumas before birth during gestation imagine the kind of long lasting damage there will be this is the kind of damage that affects physical systems , the precursor to heart problems later in life and cancer why so ? because the newly forming heart cells and other cells are being affected by a mother who is anxious and or depressed , weakening the baby s circulatory system first line damage equals first line reactions this damage may not be apparent for decades but the beginning vulnerability is already there it has changed the way that neurons develop and differentiate there is now a sort of detour going on and more , there is suppression of those traumas automatically so that each trauma evokes its own repression , and here we may have the beginnings of later cancer this means that first line repression is heavy and deleterious speaking of cancer , i am hoping to carry out some research to follow up on something we did decades ago we did a double blind study of natural killer nk cells which are part of the immune system charged with watching out for newly developing cancer cells in order to kill them after one year of our therapy there is a significant increase in nk cells what i want to do with a research team is pierce the tumor take out key cells , multiply them a lot and then re infuse those extracted cells back into the person s system slowly over time if i am not mistaken those infused cells will kill only the tumor cells and nothing else this will be a lot more efficient than chemo therapy and will only destroy cancer cells , leaving the healthy ones alone and because nk cells are genetically designed to go wherever there are the bad cells it will be less dangerous and far more effective all we need right now is the money to do it when i discuss the idea of detour it may be exactly what happens in the brain , for there is a migration of neurons from the brain stem up and when there is trauma those neurons may well take a different route in their development see the work of bruce perry in texas this migration is foremost in the earliest months in the womb so that a mother s smoking or pill popping alters the migration and brain evolution one way this happens is that we are born with a certain gene pool but how these genes evolved is due to epigenetics , events impacting genetic development this determines how the nerve cells evolve , how dense the dendrites are and how they connect with other nerve cells dendrites accept the messages from other nerve cells when they are sparse or less dense we don t get the full message a carrying mother s smoking can alter the baby s oxygen supply for life that means breathing problems later on so we have an ordered evolution of brain cells from the stem cell area on upward and each new system appears on a fixed time line these systems occur in order so that we can t speak at months brainstem functions include digestion , breathing and blood circulation if later on there are symptoms in these areas , we need to look at first line events did the mother smoke heavily in the first months of pregnancy ? if so , there are likely to be serious developmental problems including evidence of mental illness later on these primitive neurons are there long before the cortical neurons exist , both in evolutionary times and in personal ones and during gestation and the first months of life on earth they are the most sensitive to environment impacts this is no more than saying that there are critical windows when the system is the most sensitive not being touched at age ten is not going to have the impact if there is no touch right after birth what this means is that the critical period for the first line is far more malleable than later critical periods and its impact the greatest , which is why we always need to include this period in any of our studies , and especially in our therapy of patients this first line is the epoch of longest lasting effects and of the greatest impact in terms of our evolution and brain development this has been emphasized in a study by cornell university nov , , trauma earlier in life may affect response to stress years later during womb life there is a new organizing framework which determines how the person faces life later on the brain is settling in and it imprints this frame of reference to guide our lives what new research is showing is that those young children who are abused , neglected or otherwise unloved have smaller brains than those who grew up loved this implies all kinds of associated problems from learning to relating we and our brains need others we need attention and love and caring and we need it during the greatest epoch of our critical window the first line that is when there are irreversible imprints with widespread effects our lives are in danger when we are unloved when the mother is heavily depressed or drinks institutional children do die when there is no love in the first years of life so instead of children not being allowed to speak at dinner there must be lively conversations all of the time they need information and stimulation they need food for the brain so just imagine what damage happens to children who are unloved as children , and before that when the critical window is wide open during first line before birth if we can see the damage done to young children in institutions can we imagine what goes on earlier in the womb when we cannot see the damage ? the earlier the damage the more irreversible it becomes luckily we have a therapy that goes deep and undoes some of the damage but with no first line therapy there will never be a cure , not if we ignore the crucial critical window where so much impact exists there has been an attachment theory around for more than fifty years , but consider the attachment between the baby and the carrying mother where her every mood is transmitted directly to the fetus when she is anxious so is her baby when she is depressed so is her baby and as the pain mounts from womb life on there will be a greater tendency to shut off the right feeling brain and flee to the left where there is no direct pain all i am reiterating is that there is information and research to show that the earlier the impact on the brain the more damaging and long lasting the effects we must never ignore this period if we want to help our patients
