neonursechic had asked us how we make our podcasts after writing it up , i thought it might help someone else if it got put up here it 's not as hard as it sounds record i record it in garageband female radio voice does n't really matter whatever sounds best with your mic if you have n't got a mac yet , what are you waiting for ? edit edit out stuff you do n't want mostly athe beginning and end markers add in markers if desired must first click on the podcast track to enable this add links or pics if desired music add opening and closing music , as well as musical bumpers to signal transitions i put these in the jingles track , but it does n't really matter fiddle with the volume of this track so that it sounds right , fading in and out smoothly tags edit your episode info items the description is what appears in itunes to the right of your podcast it is just one line , so i make the description pretty telegraphic you can put more detail in the itunes summary tag in the xml file this is what you see if you click on the little gray i button to the right of the description in itunes save when it 's all done , click on share in the menu , then the bottom choice export podcast to disk , which saves it as an ma file xml revise your xml file accordingly that 's a whole 'nother set of instructions , so i hope you have that one down there 's a good guide at http www apple com itunes store podcaststechspecs html fix xml upload the xml file to your server and then validate your feed i use feedvalidator org fix any problems i always have problems usually because i forget to use the codes for the punctuation symbols that xml files do not allow in the tags such as amp for , apos for an apostrophe , and quot for a quote upload use itunes to convert the ma file into an mp file , then upload both versions to your server ping finally , ping itunes with your new feed it 's like speaking another language , is n't it ? the apple link above tells you how to do this this tells itunes to update its files with your new podcast lather rinse repeat you 're done ! technorati tags howto , podcast , garageband , mac , xml blogged with flock
