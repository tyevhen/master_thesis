people with anxiety sometimes have weird sensations tingling , throbbing , pinching we often suffer with these intolerable symptoms , which we describe as zips , pings , heat , freezings , and other words that will be familiar to a lot of my readers lately i ve had the return of an old friend sensation when i drive , i feel like pins are sticking into my foot it s a tingling , vibrating sensation , sometimes throbbing , and definitely uncomfortable the trigger is no surprise i have a new car , and when i bought a new car years before i had the same symptoms when i drive a rental car , i don t experience this sensation i suppose that s no surprise , because at the root of the problem is my fear that i didn t make the right choice did i buy the right car ? did i make a mistake ? should i have waited for a better deal ? and so on to cope , i ve continuously reminded myself of dr low s wisdom feelings and sensations cannot be controlled , but thoughts and impulses can be telling myself that these are simply anxious reactions does help , but i admit sometimes i feel defeated by the symptoms it can be exhausting to deal with distressing , but certainly not dangerous , symptoms all day over time , through continuous spotting and endorsement , i know these symptoms will abate they did before , and they will again there s nothing physically wrong before recovery , i would have complained about this symptom to anyone who would listen , ask friends to drive the car to check for anything wrong , take the car to the dealer to ask them to find a problem , and so on now , with recovery , i m better equipped to handle these symptoms , and i am confident things will improve soon
