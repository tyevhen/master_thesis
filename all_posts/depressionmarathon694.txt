it 's sunday , and i'm at work i'm working at my supplemental job , which is inpatient orthopedic physical therapy my day will not be over soon enough i do n't have particularly difficult patients , but i'm having a difficult time i do n't know how to explain it it 's an old , familiar feeling , and i do n't like it i feel overwhelmed , even though there 's nothing overwhelming taking place i 've had to step into a stairwell multiple times today to catch my breath and or say a prayer i like the stairwells they are gray , solitary , concrete structures with little color nor variation perfect for an overwhelmed physical therapist i do n't like being so easily overwhelmed this feeling takes me back to when i first transitioned off disability and returned to work at that time , i was constantly stepping into stairwells , sometimes to cry , or settling myself in a dark , quiet , hospital corner for a break over the years , i 've gotten my confidence back feeling overwhelmed has lessened i 've been able to work like a normal person but today , it 's back i'm anxious , overwhelmed , and filled with dread i really want to go home and go straight to bed curled up with the covers over my head seems the only safe place right now and i hate that i hate feeling like i'm going to go to pieces at any moment i hate the dread not sure i have the energy to put a smile on my face or intelligence in my voice , i dread approaching each patient i hate that , too this is all quite exhausting and without sense i'm tired i'm overwhelmed i just want to go home but i 've got patients waiting to see me , so off i go
