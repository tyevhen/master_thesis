on the drive to work the other morning , i was listening to klos , hoping to catch some pat benatar or eagles or doors or other standard l a fm radio fare instead , i started listening to a caller who said she was homeless but had a college degree and some certifications , with bookkeeping and administrative skills , recent work experience , and so on she sounded sharp spry , even the morning personalities heidi and frank asked the caller how in the world she had become homeless the woman mentioned something about a divorce and losing her job , then the next thing you know , you 're living out of your car wait , what ? actually , it 's not that hard to understand alfred postell is a harvard educated lawyer he s also homeless the economist , which bear in mind is hardly a paragon of left wing social advocacy , ran an article recently about the high cost of being poor it mentioned that in nearly half of american households said they could not cover an unexpected expense without borrowing or selling something in l a , the median rent is now around a month , so if you 're one of those ca n't afford a sudden expense households and you suddenly lose your job , it 's a very big deal it could mean moving into your car while you begin the week on average process of finding a new job back to the homeless radio show caller it turns out being homeless but college educated is in no way uncommon , although people still treat it as a freak situation which it 's not the washington post not long ago ran a story about a harvard educated lawyer who is homeless it 's the sort of story that goes viral because it 's so unexpected but it 's only unexpected because so many people are so ill informed about homelessness also , we have a strong need to believe our cherished myths about education being the key to a better life blah blah blah blah when reality collides with that sort of myth , the myth , oddly enough , tends to win in los angeles county , where i live now , about , people are homeless on any given night are college graduates nationwide , , college students are homeless also in l a , of homeless men and women are veterans of the armed forces but the homeless do n't work , right ? wrong according to a national study by the urban institute , about of homeless adults had worked in the past days that 's only about less than the population as a whole the idea that homeless people are , as a group , generally unemployed or without an income is false many work full time some have disability checks my wife is one of those she 's not homeless , but her monthly check from social security is n't enough to pay rent kafka side note she 's been turned down , in the past , for low income housing not enough income we tell ourselves all kinds of myths to avoid having to understand homelessness in any kind of detail , because it 's just too frightening a subject one of the most popular myths is that homeless people are , by and large , either drug addicts or mentally ill , or both that 's pretty far from accurate in l a , only about of homeless are mentally ill substance abuse is harder to quantify since it 's based mostly on self reporting , but the substance abuse and mental health services administration estimated , in , that of homeless people were alcohol dependent and abused other drugs that 's a lot , but it 's not , or even another myth that 's comforting somehow because it keeps us from having to think any further is that many homeless people choose homelessness we have a strong , primal need to cling to our feel good beliefs if someone is poor , it 's obviously because they chose that that 's the predominant myth sold in america if you 're not a millionaire , it 's because you did n't choose it you chose to be the loser you are not getting that dream job ? it 's because you made these common mistakes in your resume not getting traffic to your website ? it 's because you did n't follow these surefire headline writing techniques not getting the man of your dreams ? you did n't read last month 's cosmo your clothes are unflattering your hips are too big you 're not wearing the right perfume you 're not going to the gym enough not successful beyond your wildest dreams ? you did n't follow the law of attraction that 's it that 's it in a nutshell you 're unattractive to the universe in general you suck go live under a bridge and die thank you to all the crazy maniacs everyone who retweeted me yesterday buy my book or click it , at least
