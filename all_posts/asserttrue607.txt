i 've been seeing this monolog box once in a while in acrobat these days not only acrobat professional , which is still in development , but acrobat pro as well i ca n't really call it a dialog box , since it is , in fact , more of a monolog this is what i sometimes call a whisky tango foxtrot message no doubt the underlying error condition happened due to something i did in a script that 's fine , i accept responsibility for the crash what i do n't accept responsibility for is the lameness of the error message it 's a completely content free error message it tells me nothing about what went wrong it 's a billboard that says , in effect , acrobat sometimes barfs and does n't know why the point of error messages should be to tell you what went wrong , so that you can fix it or work around it , or at least know that it involves something more specific than a nameless internal error i should at least be given a code of some kind , although even that can be awfully lame , as itunes users know all too well have you ever gotten the infamous itunes error ? it 's another example of a whisky tango fox monolog box plenty of people see this error , and they turn to google in desperation to find out what it means , since apple 's web site is of scant help my september , blog on this subject a fix for the dreaded itunes error continues to bring upwards of hits a month why ? because apple displays no meaningful troubleshooting information whatsoever in conjunction with the error message it 's just a billboard for itunes' ability to barf people have to come to my blog to find out what it means how lame is that ? please , ui designers and programmers , provide meaningful error messages , or at least point me to a log file somewhere , where i can find out what went wrong if the program ran out of memory , followed a null pointer , had a stack heap collision , entered an endless loop , or choked or bad data or whatever , just tell me straight out i can live with the news , i promise
