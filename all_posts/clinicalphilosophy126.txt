r s thomas i have seen the sun break through to illuminate a small field for a while , and gone my way and forgotten it but that was the pearl of great price , the one field that had treasure in it i realize now that i must give all that i have to possess it life is not hurrying on to a receeding future , nor hankering after an imagined past it is the turning aside like moses to the miracle of the lit bush , to a brightness that seemed as transitory as your youth once , but is the eternity that awaits you commentators on thomas 's fine poem sometimes miss the fourth line but is n't that the most striking thing that one can see the miracle , even know it for a pearl of great price , and then just go on to forget about it ? this one simple fact , it seems to me , could be the basis for a whole human psychology we experience love , the balm of loving and being loved , we experience the repose this gives us , the settled wellbeing and vitality , the togetherness of mother and child not getting in one another 's way , and in this moment of knowing the melting heart , the kindly gaze , the held hand , the contentment of joint attention , security and acceptance we know with self evidencing clarity that this is all that really matters and then it just goes and we do n't even notice it going and we do n't even notice when it 's gone and then after a time of irritable bereft lostness , preoccupied by some or other agitation , we see it again , the sun illuminating the field again , and it melts and warms us , and it appalls and amazes us that we lost it why do you leave me ? when i find myself lonely , troubled , empty , irritable but , well , really you do n't leave me , it 's just that i somehow forget that you were ever there and that 's why i struggle i forget about the balm of your love , i forget about the joy of loving you is it something like this ? a song there are times when i know what love is quiet times , when my toes nestle in the warm living earth , and a smile shines in my eyes without me knowing it yes those are times when i know who you are peeking round the corners of my wish and fear , and i meet you so quietly , and listen to you there and , when i leave , you ask me to hold on to you and , sure , i do try for a while but the great forgetfulness soon clouds over me and you are hurt without knowing why , whilst i fly up towards a sun that s all my own invincible , majestic , expansive , sullen or that so exciting , desirable face i call yours is all i see and this is so hurtful to what is most human in you or my wings melt and now i am unreachable and think you ve left , though really i m plummeting down into the ocean s loneliest blue sometimes , though , i m wounded enough to be able to give something to you open heartedly , sing to you directly , and listen quietly to you singing so sorry i am that i leave you without knowing it how i wish you could tether me in the warm living earth , bind me to those times when i know what love is , quiet times , times when i know who you are , peeking round the corners of my wish and fear and i meet you so quietly , and listen to you there
