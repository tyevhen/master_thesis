i saw a commercial the other day that really made me think it asked the question , does the journey create the person , or , the person create the journey in my earlier life pre kennedy s disease , i spent several years in search of answers e g , there has to be more than this searching for the meaning of life can take you down some interesting paths i dabbled in transcendental meditation , yoga , and even existentialism i studied the different religions of the world the more i learned , the more questions i had in the end , i was still left unfulfilled my real journey began , however , with the progression of kennedy s disease when i could no longer avoid or disclaim the possibility that i had the mutated gene , my journey changed dramatically at first i felt alone and was not able to share my thoughts and fears with others i then went through the why me phase it was about then i realized i was no longer in control was i ever really in control like most everyone , my journey went through the denial , anger and bargaining phases next i progressed from there to trying experimental therapies in the end i realized that i was still trying to create my own journey and i was failing at it miserably i am a typical type a personality if something needs to be fixed , i fix it if i do not have the right tools to fix it , then i will find the right tools if i do not have the right skills , than i will find someone that does i eventually discovered accepted that there were no tools or skills out there that could fix this condition with that realization came acceptance some place after acceptance , the journey took control and it is now creating the person me i still do my darnedest to try to wrestle control away from my journey , but it seems to always win out but , by following this new path , the most interesting revelation has surfaced i believe i am beginning to understand more about me and about life in general by realizing that i do not have all the answers , the right answers seem to appear when i need them the most who knows who i would have ended up being if kennedy s disease had not shown up when it did would i have been happier , probably not would i have been more fulfilled , not necessarily learning to live with kennedy s disease is a journey i would have never taken yet , it is now my journey by embarking on this path , i have learned much about myself and even more about others one of the key lessons learned has been that people are there for you when you need them the most i liken this to what the cornfield whispered to kevin costner in the movie field of dreams if you build it they will come family , friends , or strangers , it really does not matter if you are willing receptive , they will come be there for you for those of you helping me along my journey , thank you for your patience and support you are making it possible for me to live with kennedy s disease
