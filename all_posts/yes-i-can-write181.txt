as the early registration deadline comes closer , i wanted to tell my readers about the toronto unschooling conference happening in september , it 's the only canadian unschooling conference conference , not gathering that i know of , and i'm excited to be going for the first time ! ! i'm also both excited and totally terrified that i 'll be speaking there , not just attending i 've done talks on unschooling before , but only introductory ones , where i give a short speech then answer lots of questions but this time i'm doing a real , non introductory speech a long one minimum minutes i ca n't help but find this slightly terrifying also exciting , though , so i'm just trying to look at it as a challenge and have faith that i can manage it ! i have n't written up a proper description yet i need to , and will , very soon , at which point i 'll link to it on my twitter and facebook pages , as well as the speaking at page on this blog , but basically what i 'll be talking about is unschooling in the teenage and college years , not going to college , and stuff like that i have some scattered ideas , they just need to be drawn together and fleshed out to create a proper talk ! in other interesting news , a past article post of mine that you may remember , the necessity of shakespeare , appears in the july august issue of life learning magazine , a terrific online magazine about all things life learning unschooling it 's edited by probably my favorite big name unschooling advocate , wendy priesnitz , and i'm thrilled for my article to be included in an issue that also includes an article by a marvelous author of reasons why i'm an unschooler and online friend peggy pirro , as well as awesome unschooling mom , writer , and twitter friend kelly hogaboom yeah lots of cool people ! annnd , that 's about it for updates , at the moment i 've been feeling pretty overwhelmed and drained lately not to mention emotionally volatile , so i ca n't promise there will be all that many posts in the near future , but , as always , when inspiration strikes i will write ! i hope all my lovely readers are enjoying the extremely hot , if you happen to be in certain places summer weather ! peace , idzie you might also like points for toronto unschooling conference talk a month of cool people places unschooling gatherings unschooling is forever talk now available for download ! linkwithin
