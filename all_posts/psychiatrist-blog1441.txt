a couple of things caught my attention today an article by matt richtel about bloggers , some of whom have blogged themselves to death i'm trying not to be one of them of course , the bloggers can work elsewhere , and they profess a love of the nonstop action and perhaps the chance to create a global media outlet without a major up front investment at the same time , some are starting to wonder if something has gone very wrong in the last few months , two among their ranks have died suddenly also about cyberspace , virginia heffernan wrote an article called soft cell with clinkshrink in mind prison talk , a big board with nearly , members and , regular readers a day , is a case in point it caters to what turns out to be an underserved consumer niche family and friends of the incarcerated clinkshrink and roy were kind enough to go computer shopping with me today and we got pizza afterwards is there a better way to spend a sunday ?
