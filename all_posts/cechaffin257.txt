i'm sad this morning because kathleen and i had a little misunderstanding last night , whose reverberations greeted me upon awakening i take my response for normal , but given my recent history , i may be forgiven if i fear relapse at the touch of normal sadness two good signs i wrote a new song this week , and this morning , violating my vow , a poem as well at least i think it 's a poem treated for add for tiel for ten days my mind and body have tasted synchronicity usually one runs before or behind like the trains in mexico everything i ve bruised , broken , bent , spilled , shoved , poked or kno cked over it was not a lack of zen that propelled and dispropelled me my rpms were running amok god bless amphetamines ! i also stayed up too late last night , a carry over habit from depression while in the throes of the illness i feel better later in the evening , thus desperately try to avoid sleep , knowing i will be sick when i wake it is not surprising that after our spat i reverted to this behavior then maybe one has nothing to do with the other for most of my life i have willfully resisted my body 's signal to sleep i feel as if i'm going to miss out on something if i sleep i really need to feed the rhododendrons and azaleas today but there are so many and i have to do it bucket by bucket i 've been listening to breakfast with the beatles this morning , an old tradition of mine and perhaps a bit of a substitute for church one hour of it was devoted to ringo 's new album , liverpool are you surprised that this is his th studio album ? ringo is an example of a celebrity by association without john , paul and george he would n't have made a single album it could also be argued that without john and paul , george would likely never have made an album as well hitch your wagon to a genius i should visit some friends' blogs i joined facebook at someone 's urging but i still do n't know how to behave or network through it some say this idea of a universal interactive platform , accessible from any computer like u tube , represents web i think there has been a more gradual evolution of applications though the idea of a one digit leap in net concept corresponds nicely to its digital nature love is all you need you could do worse on a sunday morning than to listen to the beatles good day sunshine , ce
