one of the best aspects of dr low s system is when you can head off a full blown panic , a real whopper of a tantrum , and or a category hurricane of symptoms just by using his method s simple , commonsense tools i had one of these mega endorsements the other night i had a big work project ahead of me color coding more than lines of an excel spreadsheet , line by line after leaving the office and having a quick dinner , i spent hours on this project , finishing up around pm after feeling quite happy about getting this task off my plate , i decided to reopen the file to double check something and to my dismay all of the color coding was gone i quickly realized that the file format i had saved the file in did not support text formatting such as colors i could feel anxious and angry symptoms start to brew , but i instantly spotted that this was a distressing but not dangerous situation i made my mental health a business and refused to participate in working up this triviality i recognized that mistakes are average and lowered my standards for myself with this self confidence , i fell asleep quickly and repeated the work in the morning , using the correct file format this time before recovery i would have called someone at the late hour to complain that would not have been group minded and would have worked me up more i would have accused myself instead of excused myself and made a mountain out of a molehill but instead i used dr low s tools to make my mental health my top priority for this i gave myself a hearty endorsement ! i endorsed for writing this post
