hi friends ! i officially have less than days until my due date today to be exact holy crap ! time is now starting to fly away from me at lightning speed and there 's nothing to be done about it we went to our childbirth class on wednesday night and were blessed to get to view a video about the stages of labor and got to watch different ladies push their babies out needless to say i felt the need for a whiskey and a vicodin after seeing that shit do n't worry , i did n't partake in either i actually never have but i had a nice dream about it later and that made all the difference in other bits , i 've now got the organ crowding happening in full force , so after i eat a small meal my lung capacity shrinks to the size of a chestnut in class the other night we were learning about a few different breathing techniques for labor we had to practice along with the teacher during fake contractions well , i about passed out thanks to the dinner i had before arriving which would have been handy if it 'd happened since we watched the video of terror right after that poor chris seemed most disturbed by the placenta delivery they did n't show it , but they did show a nurse bring the woman her placenta via a tray so she could get a good look at it this did n't bother me , but chris thought the scene was eerily close to a waiter in a restaurant showing you the meat selection before it is cooked and he was quite put out i have to agree , it did look like she was offering to cook it up but i was still too busy hallucinating from the terrors i 'd just seen to worry much about a little slab of placenta all in all , a good class and learning was had by all of course , i saw movies of childbirth in th grade health class movies that were much more graphic and detailed but i think i 'd blocked them out my own silence of the lambs issue to see it all again well i was able to handle it better this time and that 's not saying much and it 's not that i'm worried about going through that it 's the least of my worries after what we 've gone through to get where we are it 's seeing others go through it that horrified me so , as long as i stay away from delivery rooms and other pregnant women 's dilated cervixes i should be good to go save you might also like mother 's day and the birth it 's getting interesting noah 's birth linkwithin
