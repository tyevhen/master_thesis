ok , so i thought that i could make a bit of money from this blog that 's not wrong is it ? i do n't blog anywhere else for free in most cases i'm paid by the blog owner so it 's almost an involuntary action for me to expect money for blogging right or wrong , i thought i 'd give it a shot besides the cheezy adspace on the left column i signed up for the program called blogvertise com or blogsvertise com the idea is simple bloggers and advertisers are paired up and bloggers are a paid a few bucks to write an entry about the advertisers' products or sites the first entry went well so i thought we were in business i got a second assignment and wrote the entry below it was rejected because it was n't related to advertiser i did n't understand this because it is precisely and only about the advertiser how could it then not be enough about the advertiser to pass muster ? the rejection email went on to make several points that in the mind of lori , the blogvertiser employee who sent it , explain the reasons for the rejection they are make sure there are or more links to the sponsor 's site in your blog entry double check the links to make sure they are all working correctly and not tagged nofollow click on each link to verify it is working make sure you submit the permanent url so we can find the entry make sure you have not copied pasted content from the advertiser 's website make sure your entry is long enough and is related to what the sponsor 's site is about minimum of paragraphs long please review the rules and guidelines for any possible other reasons why your blog entry was rejected i went through each point but still could n't see the problem now , let me say one thing at this point i write professionally this is how i pay my bills i'm used to conforming to the needs of whomever is paying me i do n't take it personally when something is rejected or edited one has to grow a thick skin about such things i replied to this particular rejection letter politely explaining that i did n't understand what the editor was looking for and requesting some direction lori did n't respond i send another email , this time to the more generic email address for the site info or something like that still no response by now a few days had gone by and i received an automatic email telling me that time was running out it said i 'd better accept the assignment and write my entry or else now i went to the help page on the site i posted a message there explaining the situation and providing all the information they could possibly need at this point i 'd put much more work into this issue that what they were promising to pay me well , they still refused to talk to me i 've had enough i'm done with this outfit if they ca n't take a moment to answer a legitimate question from a blogger , however obvious the answer may be to them , then i have no time for them so , i m becoming a fan of st john s wort what other supplements are out there ? let 's see what 's available from fitfuel com stress control supplements these are probably closest to the kind of supplement that i 've been talking about on this blog these pills promise to relieve stress and , as an added bonus , cut down on weight in other words , relax yourself thin with these babies hgh boosters i have no idea what hgh is but if you 're afraid your hgh levels are low then this is the stuff for you according to the website it is an anti aging and bodybuilding product that will provide peak performance in every aspect of life gluten free foods do you have celiac disease ? here are some specially prepared gluten free foods this post brought to you by fitfuel com
