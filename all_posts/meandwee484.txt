hi friends ! well , we finally got an area rug in the nursery i 'd mentioned a while ago while we were planning the room that we were going to use this rug well , after being back ordered for several months it finally came in you can get it here it was gorgeous in person , but it was very thin i would n't call it a rug i 'd call it a mat or a tapestry i 'd pictured it to be more thick like a carpet type of thing so , i was concerned about the constant slipping and sliding that would happen on it even with a rug pad i do n't want to trip on it while holding little p , that 's for sure ! my other issue it had too much going on the colors in the rug are all used in the nursery , so it matched but it was just too much once in the room my eye had no idea where to look because there were patterns all over the place i'm a believer that a room should have one major focal point and maybe if they work together but no more than that if the room were simpler in color and pattern , it would have allowed for the rug to be a hero and it would have worked anyway , we sadly returned it to the store and we picked up this x foot shag rug at crate and barrel it was my original plan to use a white shag rug way back when i started the whole process of planning , so i did n't have to get used to the idea i'm thrilled with how it looks in the space and how it feels on the feet ! even with a rug pad below it was cheaper than the other rug i now feel the room is as ready as it will ever be for little p even maren the wonder dog is a fan she sinks in so deep when she 's walking on it right up to her belly my feet disappear into it i 'd never do a rug bigger than the x foot in a shag it 's a lot of lint and it 's such a particular look so there ends the thrilling tale of the rug saga i have to find some other small silly thing to obsess over now happy tuesday ! save
