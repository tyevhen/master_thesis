dear hurricane sandy , have you ever known anyone who has mental health or behavioral health issues ? if you do than your are basically ignoring the fact that for people who do not have these issues are feeling high anxiety , so imagine if you take anti anxiety medications , or you are a parent who who has a child with adhd at home because school is closed , or a senior citizen who has dementia in an evacuation area , did ya ever think about those people ? well since this is a hurricane and not a human , pretty difficult for any thought processing to be going on for all of us who do have emotions and do think what can we do to decrease these feelings ? answer anything and everything to keep your mind off the weather seriously i have no real clinical advice for these situations other than head the warnings and precautions of your local officials and for lack of better words weather the storm how could i resist that clich ? stay occupied , enjoy the day off and make sure you are safe and read blogs like a lot of blogs ! i hope this added to decreasing your anxiety levels , i will have more occupying your day off hurricane sandy posts ! breathe in and breathe out ! have a safe day ! yes
