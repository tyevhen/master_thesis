i have just read through my posts for the last month when i getreally low i do get a bit delusional and paranoid i was convinced someone would read my blog and no it was me i was also so convinced that my line management hated me , i was a nuisance to the department and they were trying to upset me as much as possible in the hope i would resign it seems a bit silly now but i was so upset and wanted to know what i had done wrong in reality nothing had changed i still feel my ex boss is a total idiot i have managed not to even make eye contact with him all week i feel so much better i think it is just a personality clash but as i do not report to him any more i do n't think i will make the effort to be civil anymore i will say good morning and be totally professional when we need to work together i will not try and help him at all or try to make him understand when he gets the wrong idea he is no longer my problem as i am no longer his i feel released as i no longer care for what he thinks of me , he can do and say what he likes now and as i no longer have one ounce of respect for him , i do n't think i care ! ! i have got more from my new supervisor in weeks than he has given me in months ! my blog may vanish again tomorrow , i 've been up and down so much i do n't know where i am today i feel calm tho' and this is the first time for quite a long time i 've missed everyone , i hope you all come back
