standing in line at the bmv , i looked at my old license picture the photo wasn t taken that long ago , because i had to get a new one after i got married not much has changed with my appearance i still wear my hair the same way , i still don t wear my glasses because i have contacts , and i still love to wear dangling earrings unfortunately , after looking at my picture , i had to notice the big w the standard physical identifiers on a driver s license are hair color , eye color , height , and weight i know i am not that number anymore and as much as i tried to pretend it didn t matter , it did a few weeks ago , while visiting a friend , i found out what i weigh currently the bathroom scale was out in the open it would have been a great drama had the internal workings of my brain been visible to weigh or not to weigh was the question the good angel lost the battle and i gave in to the temptation i had to know how much i weighed having a scale available to me without anyone else seeing me step on it was too much of a lure to resist of course , i didn t like what i saw on the digital screen i never like what i see there no matter how small the number is , it is not good enough for me i know can t handle knowing my weight after i found out the first time , i wanted to know every second of every day wondering after every meal if i had gained or lost weight , wondering every morning if my pants would be a little loser , wondering if my actions were contributing to a smaller waistline when i step on a scale , my life becomes focused on a number my goals change and my accomplishments have to do with losing weight i have a bad day if i eat and a good day if i don t eat nothing else matters expect what that number says , everything else about me fads away from my consciousness i am no longer a woman , a wife , a painter , a teacher , a helper , a friend , a sister , a daughter no i am just a number it is safe to say that me and scales don t get along i have a love hate relationship with the bathroom scale i hate seeing them but , i cannot resist its demands yet , after i know my weight i want to burn all the scales in the world i know it s bad for me , yet i keep doing it i don t have a scale in my house , but i encounter them from time to time , like at the gym , the doctor s office , or a friend s house i don t go to the gym that often , so that s not a huge issue at the doctor , i ask the nurse not to tell me my weight and i stand on the scale backward if you want to help me and other girl s struggling to break up with the scale , put your weighing machine away someplace where we can t see it in a cupboard , under the sink , in a closet , in the trash you can do it ! i believe in you ! if you can t throw away your scale yet , put a posted note on it that says i am more than this number this reminder will help you keep things in perspective you are so much more than a number that number means nothing you are a beautiful , worthy , deserving child of god it doesn t matter how much you weigh or what you look like , god still loves you
