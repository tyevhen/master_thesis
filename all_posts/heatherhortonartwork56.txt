the question is not what you look at , but what you see henry david thoreau clothesline , oil on canvas , x you may or may not have seen those commercials on television encouraging you to visit newfoundland and labrador you know the ones crashing waves , miles of pristine coastlines , and always a blowing clothesline or two ? well , let me tell you , that 's exactly what you find on the rock degrees of unfiltered beauty as i explored the northeastern , north and northwestern areas of newfoundland from wesleyville to rocky harbour , i repeatedly came across clotheslines blowing fiercely in the wind as i have mentioned in previous posts , the wind is always blowing there always it is with you every step you take i remember having to walk headlong into the gales in gros morne national park my coat flapping furiously i swear they were km h gusts but this wind keeps the air so fresh , right off of the ocean , that you appreciate it as an intrinsic component of that special place , as necessary to its identity as partridgeberry jam after seeing a few clotheslines i became inspired to paint one yet i did n't want to approach the subject matter with a traditional composition of coastline and the clothes above no i wanted to create almost an abstract piece the shapes created by the clothes flying on the line intrigued me i thought , what if i used the clothes as a horizon line ? perhaps people would look at this painting and not know what it was at first or perhaps they would it did n't matter , because the fun is in not knowing how people will see a piece i can tell before i even start painting if i will like it the composition is so important , as important as any colour that you mix or how you apply the paint usually when we see clotheslines they are above our line of sight yet here i wanted to lower the subject , and thus emphasize the vast spaces of fresh wind and sky above the skies are tumultuous and ever changing in newfoundland , probably partially due to its proximity to the atlantic ocean yet on this day the sky was robin 's egg blue , pale and constant with no clouds at all i love painting chunky , threatening clouds , but clouds were not the subject here the billow of the clothes , the play of fabrics as they whipped on the line was the focus i loved that the wind filled the towels and clothes like invisible bodies , shapeless until they encountered one another , and just as quickly were gone , replaced by other gusts if you do visit newfoundland and labrador , you will undoubtedly come across clotheslines such as these i can also guarantee that you will encounter gorgeous coastlines , purple blue water , and perhaps a part of yourself that you never knew existed you will certainly meet beautiful , authentic , windblown people who inhabit this truly unique corner of canada that 's a promise the canadians of those days , at least , possessed a roving spirit of adventure which carried them further , in exposure to hardship and danger , than ever the new england colonist went , and led them , though not to clear and colonize the wilderness , yet to range over it as coureurs de bois , or runners of the woods , or , as hontan prefers to call them , coureurs de risques , runners of risks henry david thoreau
