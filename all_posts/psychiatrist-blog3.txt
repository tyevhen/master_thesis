i just wanted to put up a quick note about two books i 've read recently black man in a white coat is a memoir written by duke psychiatrist damon tweedy so what 's it like to be a black med student and doctor , and not just anywhere , but at duke tweedy notes that he was accepted at other top medical schools , but that he went to duke because the only way they could attract african american students was by giving large scholarships that gives you a hint as to what the environment was like so it 's not surprising to read that tweedy was standing with a classmate , purposefully dressed in a polo shirt and khaki 's , only to have the professor walk into the lecture hall and ask if he was there to fix the lights ugh so not specific to psychiatry , but a good read with important insights into how racial issues play out in medicine moving on to fiction , you may remember pete earley from crazy a father 's search through american 's mental health madness pete is a mental health advocate , but at night , he steps into a phone booth remember those ? and steps out dressed as a novelist paired with newt gingrich , this fabulous novelist duo has now written books in a series duplicity , treason , and now vengeance they follow major brooke grant as she travels around the world chasing the falcon , a dangerous terrorist who ultimately knocks off everyone brooke loves or almost vengeance is by far the best of the three books , and i do n't want to say too much , because it 's a better read without the plot spoilers
