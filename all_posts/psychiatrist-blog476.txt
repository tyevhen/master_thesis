in the comment section of some of our blog posts , there have been comments about psychiatrists who lie while i have n't kept a tally of these remarks , i think the most common assertion is that psychiatrists lie by telling patients they have to remain on medication for the rest of their lives my understanding of the term verb to lie is that it requires the person who utters a communication to know that it is not true , and it often is accompanied by a deceptive motive so , for example , if a patient has a uti that can be treated with a cheap antibiotic taken for three days and the doctor knows this , but he is getting a kickback from the pharmaceutical agency and he 's having trouble filling his schedule , so he prescribes the expensive antibiotic and tells the patient you must remain on this for life , and you should come in for weekly visits or you will most certainly die , then this is a lie in medicine , we know very little for sure every now and then we do know something absolute , like that if you do nothing about a specific condition , you will die what does n't get said is that even if you do something about it , you may still die , and that no matter what , eventually you will die doctors seldom know that you must do anything , when they say you must , or you should , or you need to , they are making a suggestion or recommendation based on the evidence that is available it 's rare that evidence is complete you need to remain on this psychiatric medication for life is not any different in my book then you need to remain on a statin for life , or a blood pressure medication , or aspirin maybe you have risk factors for coronary artery disease but it 's possible you could live out your life without a statin without having cardiovascular disease , in which case you did n't need the statin was your primary care doctor lying ? of course , in the meantime , the statin could give you muscle problems , cause diabetes , or increase your risk of death by other means oh , and while we 're here , you need a pap smear every year oh , except now it 's every or years , and not after does every woman over need a mammogram ? maybe it 's ? depends which agency you ask and do n't start me on calcium , vitamin d supplements , yearly psa measurements , hormone replacement therapy , biphosphonates and all the other things we 're told we need until it turns out they kill us please note , there is nothing that currently indicates that vitamin d kills you and calcium only gives you increased risk for kidney stones , it does n't kill you , and biphosphonates do n't kill you unless perhaps they give you esophageal cancer when a patient is told they need a psychiatric medication for life , it 's because the doctor believes the risk is high that the psychiatric disorder will recur without it sometimes , it seems like a fair bet or that the risks are too high to chance not staying on a medicine seven episodes of disabling major depression that caused the patient to lose their jobs , spouse , and have hospitalizations and serious suicide attempts ? might not be a bad idea to stay on those meds , and you might not need such an extreme example to get there i like to stay away from the lines sometimes , we 're wrong after all , the recommendations are based on studies and statistics from groups of people with symptoms or illnesses , not on individuals the truth is that for most of these things , you do n't know for sure until you try stopping them and see how you do without them but to call the doctor a liar ? is n't that going a bit far ? might be better to consult a fortune teller rather than a physician
