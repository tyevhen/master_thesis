saturday entry sitting in the library , i'm listening to as tall as lions and watching as the patrons hustle and bustle about quietly i'm finally feeling better after one of the nastiest hour bugs i 've experienced in a while i have n't had energy to do much since the bug hit me square in the face yesterday morning i was caught up in its tornado of exhaustion and did the only sensible thing i could think of sleep very rare for me now i'm up about again , and i 've been thinking a lot about a conversation i had with the leprechaun the night before i became sick i had shared a journal entry with her to help her understand where my head has been lately upon finishing i looked up and noticed she was crying i was surprised i had thought the entry to be positive and affirmative an honest assessment of my life she told me with teary eyes that none of it was true my self assessment was rubbish , apparently i know adults with adhd can have inaccurate self observation , but i did n't think that i was one of them now that i am , i 've got around the corner and i 've been thinking about what i want to accomplish before then judging by milestone birthdays of days past , i can get quite worked up about my goals i put a lot of my self esteem on the line , making intense demands of myself in my quest to prove my life has meaning accomplishments are everything maybe i'm letting depression color those demands again maybe i'm just down enough on myself that my self observation is skewed or maybe a sweet , year old daughter sees me far differently than the harsh world does still , there may be some truth to her assessment of my assessment i know my heavenly father sees me differently than the world does , too it 's not too late to purge myself of the negative criticism of my adult adhd before i turn i certainly cannot accomplish the goals i have set for myself if i do n't believe in my potential therefore , anytime i feel tempted to think poorly of myself , i will recall that tear streaked face and remember i have greater worth than i realize d you might also like worth the struggle depression the best cure apparently is embarrassment do n't give up depression is worth fighting ! depression will or wallow ? part i linkwithin
