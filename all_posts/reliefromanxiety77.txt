i find that one of the main reasons people struggling secretly with their mental health is because of the fear that they wo n't be able to get a job i was once one of those people too , but now i do n't necessarily see it in the same way people feel that by declaring that they have a mental illness , or by it being on their doctor 's notes , that they wo n't be able to get a job because people will see them in a different light to the rest of their colleagues or applicants firstly , it 's important to note that there are discrimination laws which makes it illegal for a company to stigmatise you based upon your mental illness as far as i am aware , you can take them to court if you find this happening secondly , i know a lot of people who are currently in jobs who have mental illnesses and are coping just fine i have also had various types of work experience and volunteering and i have n't been asked about my mental health and if i have declared it , it has n't been an issue ultimately , the main question you have to ask yourself , is whether you want to live your life in pain whilst having the knowledge that you may or may not get hired regardless of your mental illness , or would you rather live a happy life with the high chance of a full recovery , having been diagnosed with a mental illness and still having the possibility of getting a job ? i chose the latter , and i would n't have it any other way what do you think ? do you have any extra information on this matter ? amy xx
