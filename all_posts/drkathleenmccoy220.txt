i 've done something i hope i do n't regret i 've agreed to teach a blogging course for the arizona state university lifelong learning center here it began as a discussion with the director about teaching a writing class someone else is teaching a writing your family history course offering a course like writing for publication might be too depressing traditional publishing has become so difficult these days that it 's hard to know what to tell an aspiring writer but there are some wonderful alternatives , particularly blogging , as i 've discovered the past eight months now that i 've agreed to teach the class , i suddenly feel quite inadequate i just started my blog late last october so i'm still a relative novice at all this what was i thinking ? ? ? many of you are so much more experienced than i am in the blogging world and i 'd love your help and suggestions what advice would you give someone who is thinking of blogging but a little nervous about it ? what do you wish you had known at the beginning ? do any of you do private blogs for family and friends only ? what has surprised you most about blogging ? what do you enjoy most ? least ? those of you who have a lot of followers how did you get so many followers ? ? is it a matter of writing a wonderful blog that touches a lot of readers ? reaching out to others by commenting on their blog posts ? how do you encourage people who regularly read your blog to become followers ? do any of you make money with your blogs ? or do you blog primarily for pleasure ? if you were teaching this class , what are some things you feel the students absolutely must know ? ? thanks so much for any comments and suggestions you can offer ! i truly appreciate your expertise and insights !
