the kda annual conference and educational symposium begins tomorrow in san diego i wish i could have gone , but that length of travel is out of the question these days unfortunately , we lost the heating system in our house yesterday brrrr ! and it is a little cool this morning making san diego sound even more enticing the repairmen are here and i hope we will have heat soon in the meantime , i am wearing gloves and have a blanket wrapped around me trying to stay warm and keep my fingers operational enough to type this article the conference s agenda looks very interesting this year and i am looking forward to hearing from some of the attendees afterwards i believe there are seventeen doctors and researchers attending and their presentations should be very interesting i hope the updates on asc j and igf will be positive they still appear to be the treatments with the most promise dr taylor s update on the recent research into the triggering mechanism for kennedy s disease will also be interesting one thing i know for sure , attendees will leave the conference with a new sense of hope and a greater appreciation of what these researchers go through in their attempts to find a treatment for kennedy s disease even now , with potential clinical trials close at hand , the possibility of a treatment is still at least a couple of years away patience not an attribute of mine is difficult as you watch the disease progress earlier in life , you felt there was still plenty of time now days , with the progression at a point where mobility and capabilities are far more limited , another two or three years without a treatment seems daunting yet , hoping , praying and waiting are really the only things we can do i asked the question in the header , is patience part of the acceptance process ? as i mentioned , i have never been one to have a lot of patience i was a type a personality at work believing that , along with a little luck , you created your own breaks , and that sitting back and waiting is not the way to achieve your goals yet , since i am not a researcher , i am forced to sit back and patiently wait i did find one thing to help the process move along i can make a donation for kennedy s disease research kda research grants support the front line troops the researchers helping them move ever closer to finding that needed treatment in the meantime , i will sit at my computer accepting that i have this condition and patiently waiting for the news we all want to hear
