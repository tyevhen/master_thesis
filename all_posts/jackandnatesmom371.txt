i want to talk a little bit about stimming i ca n't believe i have n't brought this up before because it is such a major part of our existence both of our kids exhibit stimming behaviors http autism wikia com wiki stimming with nate it is almost always auditory , oral or proprioceptive his very first stim was a repetitive noise , and because john and i were in tune with these type of behaviors it set off alarm bells pretty quickly after it began he also runs around humming most of the time , or repeating the same string of vocalizations , which sound remarkably like words but are not he also hurls himself at things a lot he is seeking deep pressure in doing this loves to hurl himself on the floor repetitively this probably should disturb me due to the risk of self injury , but it is such an improvement from his previous head banging walls , me , furniture , crib that for now , i 'll take it his lap running is also a stimming behavior jack 's stimming is errrr , quite a bit different almost all of his behaviors are proprioceptive and vestibular he did a lot of flapping as a toddler , but with age that has for the most part gone away he also hums quite a bit his main stim these days involves a type of rocking that is very uncomfortable mainly for mommy http www autism pdd net testdump test htm this is an uncomfortable and taboo topic for many parents jack has been exhibiting this type of behavior since he was about years old the difference is that his venue is not a pillow , furniture , the floor it 's me i know that he has no intention of making me uncomfortable , or at least did n't in the beginning , now i question that as he has gotten older , and because i have always told him it 's a private thing , and he should n't be doing this around other people , he now uses it as an attention getter so whenever i am trying to work , or i am on the phone , or trying to have a conversation with , say my mother , or my husband , the behavior starts this has been a big problem for a long time and i am at a bit of a loss his play therapist literally shrugged her shoulders at me yeah , thanks , and his ot suggested i brush him more http www ot innovations com content view it 's not that i am unwilling to do this , but i did it every hours for about months kinda burnt out but , alas , i guess i will have to give it another go i do n't want jack to feel like i do n't want him near me , but it seems that lately , every time he approaches me , this is the intent , and of course i tell him to stop i tell him he can hug or kiss mommy a million times , but that he cannot do this he laughs ugh another big provoker of this is daddy time not jack and daddy time , but mommy and daddy time can you say jealous ? ? ? ? to be fair , when john and i were going through our difficult patch , the boys physically pretty much had me to themselves it has to be a bit odd to see such a change between your parents but as with most things , jack takes his jealousy to a slightly higher level if we hold hands in the car , he has said daddy get your paws off her if we hug in comes the stimming behavior if he rubs my back , jack jumps onto the couch , removes his hand physically from my back and takes over for seconds dude , you do not interrupt a woman 's back rub ! he clarifies with us over and over again that we are married , that daddy loves mommy , which is really very sweet i have no doubt that he felt the previous tension between us , and is seeking reassurance anyway , this morning he crawled into our bed at am , sigh and found us with our arms around each other he bit john 's hand awesome and then the stimming autism affects all areas of life people all areas
