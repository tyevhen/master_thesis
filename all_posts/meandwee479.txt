hi friends ! first , i wanted to show you this cool kitchen towel i found at anthropologie , here it 's all embroidered and i would never actually use it in the kitchen for fear of getting it dirty i loved the colors and the design , so it is now draped over the back of the rocking chair in the nursery so it can be enjoyed i love finding random little things i like and trying to find an alternate use for them if i do n't want them to get dirty or ruined onto my story let me first say this everything is fine and great little p is just fine as am i and all is ducky so , on wednesday night i awoke at around am as per usual with braxton hicks contractions here and there no biggie since it 's almost every night that this happens i was in a sleepy fog and just ignored them well , by i kept waking up and noticed that there seemed to be a pattern happening and hey ! ouch ! they started to hurt like a gripping menstrual cramp that 's when my eyes popped open and i owlishly started staring at my watch when i realized there seemed to be minute intervals in between i woke my husband up to tell him about it and i tiptoed out of the room with my pillow i wanted to go lay on the couch where there was plenty of light so i could focus on the task at hand without bothering chris of course , i knew he 'd be concerned and likely unable to get back to sleep but i also knew better than to not tell him i had more painful contractions that lasted minute each and were minutes apart i got lost in a show i 'd recorded by then and realized i had n't had any more for a half an hour they disappeared completely soon after that phew ! i had my non stress test later that day , so i knew to mention the episode then later in the day , at the hospital for my nst , i told the nurse of my ordeal as she strapped me up to the monitors the baby seemed to be doing just fine and she asked me a few routine questions and all went great she came back in about minutes later and said you know , the contractions could also be from a bladder infection or kidney infection some blood and protein were found in your urine what ? i had n't felt any symptoms of those things , so i was confused i got really nervous and told her about my genetic disorder , nail patella syndrome , and how there 's a risk of renal complications for someone like me especially during pregnancy she left the room and came back with a vial and drew some blood as they 'd decided to check my kidney function thoroughly she told me that they would n't let me leave until the lab came back with the results i also had to give another urine sample in the end , the results came back normal , but with trace amounts of blood in the urine and no protein the doctor looked concerned but said it could have come from the contractions the night before and he told me to try and not worry but they 'd keep an eye on it going forward he also recommended i see a nephrologist after my pregnancy a kidney specialist so , it 's on the list of doctors to see once this is all over i need to see an orthopedist for my horrible hip tendonitis issues as well and i wo n't even go into detail about the root canal i'm supposed to have as soon as possible after delivery sigh anyhoo , i'm now chugging water and keeping my feet up the doctor said he would consider letting the contractions go and let things happen if i was weeks or past but it 's still a little too soon this surprised me and he said ideally he 'd like me to hold on for another weeks at least i want to get little p as fully grown in there as possible so i'm doing what i can to stay relaxed and am taking it as easy as possible but this is certainly starting to get interesting ! ! ! it 's notable that my mom gave birth to my older brother during her th week her water had broken that is next week for me that makes everything seem all the more real and imminent ! i should note my brother had a nice birth weight and was jaundiced but otherwise was ok he went home after a few days in the incubator this helps me with my worry as i hope to not have a baby born sick and struggling so , that 's the latest story the end all is well and now i am sucking down a chocolate milkshake with wild abandon as my after lunch treat every good story needs a happy little ending , right ? save you might also like mother 's day and the birth noah 's birth the soothsayer linkwithin
