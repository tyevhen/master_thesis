time flies ! it is hard to believe it has been seven months since i started taking dutasteride i was reviewing my journal this weekend i averaged minutes of exercise every other day the average time was down slightly because of a trip and a visitor on two occasions where i had to end the workouts early i still have not experienced any negative side effects worth noting was that several times over the last month i commented that i had a very strong workout and i could have performed many more reps because i wasn t tired even more important in my opinion are my comments about the sustained energy level that i continue to experience for most of us with kennedy s disease , the ups and downs we experience in energy are frustrating i have just not had any down days for me , that is worth the price of admission other news asc j nih is testing the oral version of asc j on small animals i have written about this possible treatment in several articles see below j provides a lot of hope it will be many months before the results are known , but i am keeping my fingers crossed other articles that refer to asc j ginger , curry may offer cure to kennedys disease research news from the kda conference a chat with dr j paul taylor part ii good news on the research front asc j ameliorates spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy phenotype curcumin asc j curcumol
