it occurred to me that there are ways to find out if we can fall in love , whether we can sustain a relationship and how close we can be to others we can enter into our physiology for answers to these questions for in that physiology lies our history , our emotional past that can help predict the future we can slice into the problem from many different perspectives but for now i will choose only one oxytocin i call it the hormone of love when we make love our oxytocin levels mount if we rub an animal s belly levels rise making love tells us the importance of oxytocin since that act is the origin of life oxytocin is a neuro hormone that is a key hormone of love when the level of oxytocin is low there is less emotional attachment , less interest in social engagement , less caring and bonding , and less touch in short , less love less love has a physical base less love early in our lives can be found in an imprint , which affects many systems these effects are measurable in some respects , love is a measurable entity the imprint affects sexuality , particularly how key brain structures such as the amygdala and hippocampus translate pain into sexual behavior oxytocin is found only in mammals when it is high , one experiences a sense of relaxation , rest , and growth , repair and healing , loving behavior and emotional attachment love and nurturing early in our lives are necessary for optimum health , and healthy brain development cannot take place without it it isn t just that low oxytocin levels are an indicator of early neglect and lack of touching , it also indicates a dysfunction of the entire system , and serves as a prognosticator of our later mental and physical health its presence says , i was loved and could develop normally , its lack says , i was unloved and my system is skewed it is one of the key indices of how much love we received in infancy and around birth in the same way that we may increase sexual drive in males with testosterone injections , it may well be that we can inject love into people , or at least inject a hormone that encourages it give people a shot of love , so to speak this shot may help us attach to others and bond with partners , allows us to feel close to someone else , to feel and empathize with their feelings and pain bonding is a strong emotional attachment that helps us want to be with one another , to help and protect one another , and to touch and become sexual with one another high levels of oxytocin encourage and strengthen bonding because early trauma and lack of love affect the output of this hormone , the ability to relate and have good sex later is determined even before birth and just after someone can swear she is full of love , only to find herself very low in the essential hormone of love oxytocin it is actually good news that less love has a physical base , for there may be something we can do chemically to alter that state , and there is certainly something we can do psychologically to change it , as well at sometime in the future we may be able to determine what proper love from a parent to a child is through the measurements of various hormones , not the least of which is oxytocin , which , as i state , has been in wide use to help birth along , affecting contractions in the mother pitocin early parental love is a permanent painkiller rats who were able to self administer painkillers by pressing a lever did not do so when given oxytocin oxytocin ot inhibits the development of a tolerance to drugs such as morphine , and also decreases the painful withdrawal symptoms that occur when one is taken off these drugs the degree of addiction can be measured by the severity of one s withdrawal , yet oxytocin reduces the severity of these symptoms love will do the same thing early love calibrates the system for life a current shot of love , such as someone hugging and kissing us , may well change the levels temporarily if we rub the belly of an animal the oxytocin levels will rise immediately , but once the initial critical period of the system s development has passed , every change we can effect will be transient once we arrive at adulthood , oxytocin levels are fairly set one can be given a shot of it , but it will not have a permanent effect , for once low levels of oxytocin or high levels of stress hormones are registered early in life , it is difficult to re establish normal set points after the critical period to receive love is over , the only way to normalize the system is to neuro chemically relive the early events that dislocated the set points the critical period is the time when a need must be fulfilled it can never be recaptured after that period all we can do is play catch up if we are to ever have any chance at normalization we must feel again unloved that enables us to go back to the point of deviation or dislocation and rewrite the scenario and return the body to its correct set points in that way only can we right the ship and return to the original biologic settings it is that agony with all its concomitant biochemical components , that , when fully experienced , helps normalize the system and when i mention normal , it seems to me that one of the key indices of normality is the ability to give and receive love this is what patients should expect out of a psychotherapy we do know that in our measurements of the salivary cortisol the stress hormone there was a return to normal levels after one year of primal therapy see primal healing for a full discussion in various other avenues we find the same phenomenon true of heart rate and blood pressure we assume it will be true with oxytocin levels we make that assumption because our patients state over and again how they finally could relate to a partner and feel comfortable in an emotional relationship after the therapy there are many kinds of hormones that play into love and sex i am extracting these for discussion and to show how early experience affects adult behavior many years ago we studied testosterone in our male patients we also classified those who were low on testosterone as parasympaths those dominated by the passive , reflective , healing nervous system those , who were high in testosterone , tended to be sympaths , meaning they were more aggressive , goal seeking , optimistic and ambitious looking ahead , an analogue of the birth process after one year of primal therapy , those who were low on testosterone tended to rise , while those who were very high tended to come down a bit in brief , their systems would normalize when it comes to love , however , oxytocin is by far the most important hormone the question we now face is what came first lowered oxytocin and then the inability to love and to bond , or the lack of early love , which lowered the set points of oxytocin ? i would choose the latter because hormones are so sensitive to early trauma , we must take care not to blame high or low levels to genetic factors we must never forget the critical nine months of life in the womb bonding is the most positive aspect of human relationships we learn how to bond emotionally in adulthood through early bonding in childhood , as simplistic as that sounds it cannot be taught ! and it certainly cannot be taught in later life attachment is pretty well set in our childhood it is not something we learn it is something we feel it is also something biochemical those who did not bond very early on with their parents may well be condemned to a lifetime of broken , fragile , tenuous relationships it may be in large part due to deficits in the hormonal wherewithal such as oxytocin oxytocin researcher thomas insel has remarked that , many of the affectional ties to the mother observed post natally after birth could be laid down by pre natal experience life in the womb may determine life outside the womb for decades to come if the early relationship with one s parents was distant , alienated and glacial , it may be a harbinger of the love relationships we have or do n't have later in life the earlier the alienation from one 's parents , the more trouble there may be in relationships later on i have seen it in hundreds of my patients it approaches a biologic law if my sampling of our patients is any index in certain mountain rodents such as the mountain vole , a species that lives an isolated life as differentiated from the prairie vole , which is more social , a shot of oxytocin proved to encourage bonding and pairing between voles after repeated injections there was a long acting anti stress effect , which calmed overall behavior and gave rise to a strong tendency to bond this again indicates that early love supports calmness and serenity those humans who are able to bond with others have high levels of oxytocin love seems to be the ultimate painkiller and a permanent one it prepares us for the challenges of life and is the ultimate survival tool need a good sex life ? be loved early on by your parents that means , inter alia , right after birth and for the few months afterward by that i mean plenty of hugging and kisses touch is ne plus ultra suffer from perversion ? it may be because early in life , you were twisted by your parents in the quest for love parents whose personalities made implicit demands on the child to be someone else non coomplaining , passive , listening never speaking there is enough evidence to show that a newborn 's heart rate , body temperature , and respiration rate are governed by the mother when she is loving and nurturing towards the baby she carries , there is a positive affect on the baby and the set points of heart rate and blood pressure become normal any neglect she inflicts changes the biochemistry of the baby , perhaps permanently her anxiety and depression during pregnancy may very well alter the offspring 's sex hormone levels we know , for example , that anxiety in the mother can and does alter the sex hormone level of the fetus and can feminize infant males so what we see is that once a male is feminized he is vulnerable , more vulnerable to a lack of love during infancy and childhood he may become homosexual as a result of a cold , distant father , while the one who is not vulnerable will remain heterosexual we need to understand that at certain levels of vulnerability , stress , trauma or pain can produce an overload and channel them into a symptom in this sense , homosexuality could be considered a symptom , in the sense that there is a latent tendency , a feminizing , which only becomes overt homosexual behavior due to trauma i e , the lack of a father s love if the father s love is there , it remains a latent tendency the female prairie vole , when treated soon after birth with steroid stress hormones , showed an increase in masculine behavior , such as mounting most of us do n't have to be injected with stress hormones stress in the womb and just after birth accomplish the same thing , and may indeed masculinize females although we may think that an injection is something special , the same chemical process takes place naturally we can inject oxytocin , or we can massage the animal , and increase oxytocin levels that way we can create stress for a pregnant woman , or inject her with steroids the psychological effect is precisely the same as from a needle a mother can be kind and loving and raise the serotonin levels in her offspring so that he can better handle adversity or a doctor can inject serotonin into the offspring and produce a temporary calming effect that is no different than that created by a loving look from the mother a mother can inject oxytocin into her baby through her milk , which contains high levels of the hormone love , or what looks like it , can be injected when injected naturally and at the proper time it will produce a loving human being oxytocin means quick birth a synthetic oxytocin known as pitocin , is given to mothers who need stimulation for contractions i surmise that some mothers who need oxytocin to expedite the birth process may have had a history of pain that lowered their levels so as to make giving birth difficult statistics indicate those mothers who give birth by cesarean have lower levels of oxytocin additionally , when oxytocin is given to mothers to facilitate the birth process , it also enhances the love they feel for their child they nurse better and are more relaxed with the baby conversely , a chronically anxious mother may leave her offspring with low oxytocin levels , which will contribute to the child having trouble later in life with bonding and forming attachments , as well as harboring a latent tendency to addiction thus , lack of early love translates into inadequate chemicals with which to bond , creating a vicious cycle of misery unhappy relationships , poor sexual function , and failed marriages with suffering , abandoned children who bear the brunt of something that had its root causes in the infancy of the mother loving feelings are transmitted to the fetus through the biochemistry and oxytocin levels of the pregnant woman , and then later through physical contact , which again raises oxytocin levels if we were not loved early on , looked at , touched , listened to , nuzzled and adored , those biological changes , subtle though they may be , follow us throughout our lives yet a mother who takes good care of herself , is not depressed or anxious , does not take drugs , and eats properly , will produce a loving child if the traumas of birth , pre birth and early childhood are inundating the system there will be an eventual overload and breakdown of the neuro inhibiting , suppressing systems serotonin , as well as oxytocin there are many chemicals that live in the gaps between nerve cells , neurons some push back and while others facilitate the message of pain they are either information blockers or enhancers supplies of neuro inhibitors will be used up over time in the fight to keep pain down these supplies are not inexhaustible it is the very earliest pains that have the highest valence and require the greatest amount of inhibition these biochemicals will be used in the battle against emotional deprivation the system will eventually be less sexual as the hormones of love become transmuted into the job of holding down pain a therapist can ask us , were you loved ? , and we may insist , absolutely , yet we are betrayed by our oxytocin levels , which are far too low , and by our stress hormone levels , which are far too high , and also by our hormone levels which may be quite deviated they speak too the body and its physiology do not lie indeed , we may have been loved after birth , but suffered severe traumas in the womb of which we remain completely unaware our physiology will tell us the truth
