this is my th post on depression marathon wow i began writing a little less than two years ago i never envisioned this thing getting this far i feel like i should say something really profound or symbolic , but i do n't have anything like that in mind maybe simpler words are good enough wow i'm pleased , proud , and grateful i started this blog to educate and support others about mental illness instead , i 've received so much support from my readers , it 's no wonder i'm feeling better than ever thank you i 'd like to continue as long as you 'll continue to read i will continue as long as i have something meaningful to say thank you for the opportunity to be a tiny part of your days by the way , i do have some profoundly good news puck 's biopsy revealed a benign gingival gums tumor it will likely come back , and if it does so aggressively , it will have to be more completely removed right now , i'm just watching the spot if it comes back , i pray it will be a slow , non aggressive tumor i really do n't want puck to go through another surgery he 's been through enough i'm very , very thankful he does n't have cancer thanks for your prayerful thoughts
