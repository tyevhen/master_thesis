if there is one thing that makes me nervous , even worst , that scares me is motorcycles and bicycles on the road i am so afraid i will hit one of them no matter how hard i work at being careful around them they seem to appear out of nowhere , behind me , beside me and i look , i do they are so small and hide in my blind spot so very well days where there is rain or winter when it 's snowing , they are not there and with good tires and a well running car , i much rather drive that beautiful summer days where they are out in full force if i have an accident for some reason during a thunderstorm or during a snow storm , all those involved are encase in steel and somewhat safe a person on a bike , whether it be bicycle or motorbike has no such protection they can die so easily , or like a former friend of mine get very very hurt anyway just thought i would share thanks for reading you might also like broken mirror ? ? ? another dream reached potholes linkwithin
