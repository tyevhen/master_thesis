do you remember the cereal commercial where everyone shoves a bowl of cereal at the dumb little brother to watch for his reaction ? mikey wo n't like it , he hates everything ! but surprise , mikey does like it ! we sent the final chapters of the draft of our book to our editor so far , the process entails a bounce back , and sullen words like this is n't working and then a lot of obsessing , a re write , and finally we get to , this is much better it 's become a bit of a joke we build in time for her to hate it this sunday , i stayed in my pajamas i sat in front of a computer all day long i did n't go out i was ironing out the kinks in the last two chapters roy well , i knew he was trying to write because he was commenting on old blog posts and he opened a new facebook account why ? i was ready to scream i told editor and clinkshrink which day to reserve for roy 's funeral and to get their suits out roy did n't get it , he informed me he would be out of town that day and could go to a funeral on sunday maybe he did get it put the suits away am and roy 's chapter was sent to our editor mine were sent a few hours earlier much quicker turnaround than usual she likes them ! i feel like those little kids when mikey likes the healthy cereal i'm taking a moment now to just be happy
