last week , amidst all the news fall out over that egg study , lance armstrong , and neil armstrong , a few other studies were noted that have some evpsych relevance here is a music selection for the sunday morning reflective crowd chopin 's ballade no and let 's just get it over with vitamin d supplementation and depression in the women 's health initiative calcium and vitamin d trial okay , huge double blind randomized controlled trial over , women , randomized to placebo or mg calcium iu vitamin d daily for years depression scores were measured via questionnaire one i 've never heard of , the bernam scale and antidepressant use maybe problematic because different classes of antidepressants have varying uses , for example , tcas are prescribed for migraines and chronic diarrhea , and ssris are used for anxiety at baseline and several follow up points in addition , a subset women actually had d levels measured during the trial beginning average level was nmol l which is about ng ml in the units i will typically see on a lab report form after two years and measuring a separate group of some odd people , the average level in the supplemented group was higher than those who were not supplemented assuming a similar ng ml starting point , two years of d supplementation increased levels to kinda scary that the average level of these women at the beginning is just a tick north of absolutely deficient even according to the conservative institutes of medicine iu does seem to prevent rickets , and it is similar to the amount of oral vitamin d one might be expected to get from eating cold marine animals but it certainly does n't make up for recommending the entire population avoid the sun at all costs in the end , supplementation with iu vitamin d and calcium was associated with an increased chance of reporting depressive symptoms the odds ratio was , though , not too terribly exciting and not associated antidepressant use compared to placebo i'm not surprised , and i'm somewhat annoyed with vitamin d studies and depression at this point studies tend to use teensy levels or enormous ones and please see that link for a round up of the relevant d and mental health studies why do n't we find a middle ground between iu and , iu literally ? i 'll share my clinical experience , which , being anecdotal , may not be worth much i 've been more aggressive about measuring vitamin d in the last few years as have the internists i work with , and i would say roughly of the folks i measure or have had a d measured in the past year by the primary care doctor are absolutely deficient meaning below ng ml levels between are common , but i 've seen s and s as well the super low folks have tended to have a sick look pale , circles under the eyes , bloated , tired though not everyone who is pale and tired has a low d by any means ! if i had to guess from just looking at them , i would think they might be fighting a cold or were hypothyroid most of the time , the thyroid function is absolutely normal most of the folks i see have depression , and typically some sort of resistant depression , and i would say of people come to me having already been put on psych meds of some kind it 's a bit hard to generalize , each patient has his or her own particular circumstances , character strengths , education , and external stressors but i 've figured out that some long term patients with ultra low vitamin d finally responded to all the psychiatry mucking around bolstering supports , lifestyle interventions , therapy , medication adjustment after the d was corrected shorter term patients have looked better and done better since getting d out of the basement i 've never attempted an isolated d intervention which would n't be standard of care by any means so , while resistant depression generally requires a lot of adjustments in different areas of life to get trending a better direction and to get people more functional and happier , i surmise that replenishing super deficient vitamin d may be one of those adjustments that ought to be done and likely wo n't hurt , and seems to be a piece of the puzzle out of place in resistant depression knowing the role of vitamin d in the nervous system so far as inflammation reduction and neuronal repair , there 's a sensible mechanism at play as well another interesting bit to the d replenishment story in the past two years , four of my patients have developed high calcium with adequate d supplementation to bring the levels above ng ml three of them were found to be hyperparathyroid , and parathyroid tumors were found and later removed , resolving many of the original psychiatric complaints the fourth patient is still undergoing a work up but since a lump was palpated on the parathyroid , it is likely she has a tumor as well when i was in medical school , surgeons absolutely loved parathyroid cases because they were relatively rare i do n't know if four patients in two years is another anecdotal anomaly for me , but i do measure calcium along with vitamin d , and if the calcium pops above with supplementation , i'm very quick to refer the patient back to the primary care doctor for further work up having seen so many cases so recently , i would n't recommend supplementing a super low d particularly below , which is low enough that hyperparathyroidism can be masked by the low d level aggressively without measuring calcium along with it if you have normal levels say or above moderate supplemention of iu daily is probably fine , because if you had hyperparathyroidism , you would already know it , but keep measuring
