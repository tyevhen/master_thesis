burger flipping as a career option is the topic of a lot of jokes in america , but it 's no joke to those who actually work in the fast food industry the following stats , from a recent report by the u c berkeley labor center , highlight the true costs to society of keeping wages low in the fast food sector more than half percent of the families of front line fast food workers are enrolled in one or more public programs , compared to percent of the workforce as a whole see graphic this is true even when the workers in question are working hours a week the cost of public assistance to families of workers in the fast food industry is nearly billion per year at an average of billion per year , spending on medicaid and the children 's health insurance program chip accounts for more than half of these costs due to low earnings , fast food workers' families also receive an annual average of billion in food stamp benefits and billion in earned income tax credit payments people working in fast food jobs are more likely to live in or near poverty one in five families with a member holding a fast food job has an income below the poverty line , and percent have an income two times the federal poverty level or less for more stats , see this mother jones piece of course , low wages are a problem throughout the restaurant industry , not just the fast food piece the problem extends to retail as well a walmart in ohio recently made news when it held a food drive for its own employees industry apologists will argue , of course , that if walmart or mcdonalds had to pay hr starting pay , they would go out of business that 's complete nonsense u c berkeley 's labor center researchers have already done the arithmetic for walmart if walmart were to set a pay floor of hr , the average net cost increase to shoppers would be cents per store visit a similar calculation for mcdonalds comes to much the same answer mcdonalds serves million orders a day through , restaurants figure minimum wage hours worked per restaurant per day every extra dollar an hour in wages comes to cents extra per customer order so mcdonalds , if you 're listening , what 's your response to this ? i 'd like to know leave a comment below
