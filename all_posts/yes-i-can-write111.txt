but you have to learn to get along with people you do n't like ! says yet another commenter on the latest mainstream media piece on unschooling and sudbury valley schools , in this case i'm baffled by just how nonsensical to borrow one of my sister 's favorite words the reactions people have on first hearing about unschooling often are , but this might just be one of the most baffling because it seems to imply that unschoolers never see any people ever school is obviously the only place where children and teens can find and interact with other human beings obviously the people who make such statements must believe the above otherwise , how could they possibly think that i , or other unschoolers , never meet or met people we do n't like ? i can think of plenty of people i do n't get along with , or do n't particularly like the kid who used to be one of my sister 's best friends the guy who derails the conversation at every workshop he attends multiple people i had to work with when i went to cadets various extended family members hell , a few people i 've met at not back to school camp and conferences ! sadly , life is filled with people who , to put it bluntly , are assholes people who treat others poorly bullies people who do n't seem to realize that working respectfully with others is even an option you can and will definitely find those people in school but , even if you never set foot in a school , you 'll still find those people the whole thing with living and learning in the real world is that , well , you tend to run into the things commonly found in , you know , the real world all sarcasm aside , people definitely do need to learn how to work with people whom you do n't particularly get along with , but you definitely do n't need a special place to do that you just need to live now , i also think it 's important to note that what i'm talking about is just not getting along , or not particularly liking someone dealing with low grade assholes i wonder if some of the people who question whether unschoolers will ever learn to get along with people they do n't like , are actually just making a softer statement to the effect that kids need to be bullied to get tough 'cause that 's a whole different issue ! and it probably wo n't surprise anyone when i say that abuse , no matter what form it takes , is never something hat should be considered good or character building just picture me saying no in the most forceful possible way comments on internet articles are often a toxic place to read , but they can be useful they 've sparked many posts before , for instance ! in seeing what a lot of people actually think , and can be used to call out ignorance and bigotry , and share some actual truth and experience instead i feel like i 've said most of what i say in this post before , but i 've decided to take hold of any spark of blog writing inspiration that comes along , and to let go of an attempt at perfection , because otherwise , i wo n't end up writing anything at all ! so there you have it and now i'm wondering what you thought of the latest mainstream article on unschooling and sudbury schools ? did you read the comments , and if so , did any thoughts or posts share the link ! stem from doing so ? you might also like blame unschooling ! favorite unschooling posts on this blog of unschooling are we teaching ourselves ? misconceptions about unschooling linkwithin
