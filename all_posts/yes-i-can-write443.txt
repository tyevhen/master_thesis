guess what ? it's snowing ! ! big wet flakes that melt on tongues and catch on eyelashes that sting your face and delight your soul that make wet sounds as they hit the pavement and melt , yet cover the lawn in a carpet of white wonder the first snowfall is always something magical and soul lifting ! each new season brings such joy , that it would be absolutely impossible for me to pick a favorite season i always tell people that my favorite seasons are the current one and the next one ! the world never ceases to amaze me , to uplift me , to make me unbelievably happy so here 's to the wonder of life peace , love , happiness , and lots of snow , idzie
