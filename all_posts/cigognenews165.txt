there is someone who is doing heroic work in the shadows , who does not get paid but who works many hours a day she supervises all clinical work , and teaches the basics of the therapy , runs the administrative side of the center and deals with all outside inquiries in short , the pivot around which the clinic revolves she is the engine , the motor for the advancement in the practice of primal therapy she is there to help therapists work with patients who could do any more ? she is our resident savant dr france janov it is hard to realize , even for me , how much work goes into directing even a small clinic , a clinic that has patients from countries , and requires communications among people from many countries of the world and oh yes , she is my wife of years what does it mean to run a psychiatric clinic ? it means knowing the latest science so as to help therapists know how our therapy fits in with science it means knowing the various afflictions people suffer and why it involves knowing about people from different countries and how they differ as a population for ex , what is the most repressed country and what is the least ? it is a wide ranging job that requires clinical skills , financial ability , relevant science and how to help our therapists relate to foreign patients some who only have minimal skills in english needless to say , it is a job well done , too often done in the shadows by someone who manages to keep it all going well she has done this for years without pay it is a labor of love or her and also because primal therapy saved her life she teaches not out of academic persuasion , but because she learned out of her own feelings for a very long time our thanks to france
