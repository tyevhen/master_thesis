well after my whining yesterday see last post i did get out the door and run rather than a speed workout of miles , i set my sights on an easy miles i made it miles then i went back to bed for an hour before my aa meeting , which i followed with minutes of weight lifting thankfully , it was n't a totally useless day this morning brings new revelations as a result of yesterday 's short run my left calf is not healed i do n't know why i expected it would be with the exception of the week after the marathon , i never really let it rest it hurt for the first couple of miles yesterday , but i was encouraged when the pain subsided unfortunately , this morning it is worse i have pain in my calf and shin tendinitis i need to take some time away from the running , i guess that means i 'll be back in the pool today it also means i will have to change my upcoming goals i had hoped to run another marathon in each of the next two months i think a december marathon is definitely out of the question now i will plan to run in clearwater , florida in january instead i will lose some running fitness between now and then , which is exactly what i did n't want to happen , but i suppose i should listen to my yelping leg i'm looking forward to the day when i can cruise along pain free again
