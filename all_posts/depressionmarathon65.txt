maybe i'm being too cautiously optimistic too soon , but maybe , perhaps , hopefully , i might be feeling a little bit better i 've had tms treatments , and up until friday nothing had changed but then again i was n't expecting any miraculous change , as the psychiatrist told me it may take weeks of day per week treatments before i noticed any improvement , if there was going to be any improvement at all i think maybe there has been some improvement and it seemed to happen suddenly friday afternoon it was really quite strange all of a sudden friday afternoon i noticed i was feeling more energetic , more positive , and more hopeful i was lighter , moving at more normal speed as opposed to the slow motion of the previous several weeks , and processing life a bit quicker it was like something had shifted i took note , but i was careful not to get too excited however , as my friend , wendy , pointed out , even if the next day again sucked , a few moments of feeling better were worth it too true ! as it turned out yesterday was not great , but it was n't horrible either i was really fatigued and had very low motivation , but i think my mood was still lighter even though i did n't do much all day today i continue to feel a little bit better jet and i ran miles this morning it was a beautiful , sunny day , and the city was very quiet , as it often is on holidays , so it was a nice run i'm glad i did n't have more than miles on the schedule , though fourteen was definitely enough now i'm just enjoying the sunny day i resume my tms treatments tomorrow afternoon i certainly feel more enthusiastic about attending my appointments now that i have some evidence the treatments may actually be making a difference already i'm feeling extremely cautiously optimistic the only possible side effect i 've noticed is trouble sleeping i 've been unable to fall asleep when attempting to nap , and it takes me a lot longer to fall asleep at night since i began tms but if that 's as bad as it gets , no problem i 'll deal with it i want to thank all of you who have been so faithfully following along over the past few months your comments have been so kind , thoughtful , and compassionate i am so very grateful thank you you 're readership and interactions with me through this blog have made a huge difference in my life huge it is so helpful to know i am connecting with some of you or even making a difference in somebody 's life despite my despair i really ca n't explain it well enough thank you for reading , and if moved to do so , please keep commenting you are making a difference , and i appreciate it carry on , my friends !
