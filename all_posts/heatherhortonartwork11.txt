there , on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds clambering to hang , an envious sliver broke when down her weedy trophies and herself fell in the weeping brook her clothes spread wide and , mermaid like , awhile they bore her up which time she chanted snatches of old tunes as one incapable of her own distress , or like a creature native and indued unto that element from hamlet , by william shakespeare we are over water , and so like a bee to honey many of us enjoy flying through that ubiquitous element that makes up so much of what we are i have become hypnotised by water , by it 's perennial undulations to try to capture those patterns with paint is a tough task however the practice of scaling a wall of water is a job i love each thing that an artist attempts to paint and imbue with their own fingerprint is different skies are some of the toughest things to paint , especially calm skies when there are storms , with choppy clouds and angry horizons it is easier , but a clear , bluebird day is a hard thing to capture and so it is with water smooth water is tough for me , but the reflections and refractions of light through the waves is a much more satisfying thing to tackle perhaps it is because i dislike smooth gradations of paint i dislike blending , but prefer to let the brushstroke and pigment sit there and kibbutz with the other planes of light and colour i like the chatter of a variety of brushstrokes and angles of application this is the fourth painting i have done like this i cannot help it like a sailor needs to return to the sea , i keep going back to these cerulean paintings perhaps it is a way to continue to see my friend hannah , who lives a distance away from me perhaps it is because of her personality , her vivaciousness , that i return here too it is all connected the coastline of carry le rouet in the south of france http en wikipedia org wiki carry le rouet a few years ago i was in france and my hosts and i drove down to the mediterranean sea i remember craning my neck to see over the hillside that i knew rose up by the highway and then swept down to the big blue as my friends called it and sure enough , when i first saw it , it took my breath away such deep , rich teals flew by as we neared it , a diaphanous expanse of turquoise that compelled you to get closer i lamented not having my bathing suit with me but waded into the cool , salty water until it was over my knees even when i was as small child and my mother first put me in a swimming class , where they had a little platform under the water that enabled little children to jump off into the terrifying five foot depths , there was something familiar and effortless about it all like an embrace that never quite hugs you back , it supports you but will let you fall if you do not work to retain stability water is a strange and beautiful paradox it takes many lives , but also restores life , is essential to life to contemplate water is to contemplate yourself and to paint water , well , perhaps another form of knowledge lies in those blue tubes of paint as well hannah , osmosis , is x , oil on panel , and is currently available at abbozzo gallery in toronto , ontario thank you for reading and have a beautiful weekend , heather there is a tide in the affairs of men , which taken at the flood , leads on to fortune omitted , all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and miseries on such a full sea are we now afloat and we must take the current when it serves , or lose our ventures william shakespeare
