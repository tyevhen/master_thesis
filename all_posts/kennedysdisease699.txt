definition of trust firm belief in the reliability , truth , ability , or strength of someone or something i grew up trusting that my muscles would be there whenever i needed them i never thought about walking , running , standing up , picking things up , opening jars or cans , eating and drinking , or playing sports it was natural and easy a god given ability when i first stumbled and later when i first fell , i would laugh it off thinking that i was just getting old i never once considered these events to be associated with anything neurological even when stumbling or falling happened a little more often , i still dismissed any thoughts that something strange was happening to my body i did what any person would do i exercised harder and , the cramping was just a byproduct of my more intense workouts today , i survive because i have a lack of faith in my ability to walk , stand up , etc i cannot trust that my muscles will respond the way they should to keep me upright and free from harm i don t like living like this , but i know it is better to be safe than sorry even with this skepticism , i still occasionally find myself in trouble a knee might buckle , my grip might fail , or my throat might close off what trust i had in my strength , was extinguished long ago now , every day is a good one when i do not have a scare even though i can no longer place my trust in my muscles abilities , i still trust that i can be a resource , an ear to listen , and a voice when called upon it is my calling it is what gives my life meaning keep the faith !
