for this post i'm reviewing a paper from neurology , october , homocysteine and holotranscobalamin and the risk of alzheimer 's disease along with the accompanying editorial , beauty and the beast b , homocysteine , and the brain a bemusing saga ! neurologists do n't have much time for poetry , i'm guessing dear neurologists and cardiologists , sorry for making fun of you all the time as if a neurologist or cardiologist would bother to read this blog there i go again so what 's the scoop ? we know the brain needs b why ? b is a cofactor in all sorts of enzymatic reactions to make neurotransmitters without neurotransmitters , the brain is left high and dry rather like a rock band without groupies or a fan club homocysteine is a part of the b vitamin processing shenanigans , and high levels homocysteine tend to indicate low levels of b and folate past observational studies have more or less shown that people with high homocysteine have more heart attacks , strokes , and dementia , while people with low vitamin b seem to have more dementia , cognitive impairment , and an increased rate of brain atrophy i say more or less , because some studies do n't show a connection , but overall , the tendency is for b to be associated with a happy brain , and for homocysteine to be associated with an unhappy brain this tendency makes biological sense , so we can nod our heads a little in consideration important note the organ meat eating dietary pattern that was associated with alzheimer 's disease in this study was especially high in b ! weird , huh ? as in totally does n't make any biologic sense ? chris masterjohn covers the silliness of dietary pattern studies in this wonderful post i have a number of posts on certain dietary patterns and mental health disorders i post on them because they are pretty much the only studies of diet and mental health we have , but i hope everyone understands the limitations of these studies as in , they are extremely limited , incredibly vulnerable to data mining , and observational in nature we ca n't make too many conclusions from the studies , though they may offer some ideas for some future hypotheses here 's probably the most interesting thing about this study homocysteine and holotranscobalamin and the blah blah instead of measuring straight up serum b , they measure the biologically active fraction , holotranscobalamin otherwise known as holob they suggest that holob is the best lab test to measure b deficiency , which is news to me and since i test b all the time , that 's useful information what is little known to psychiatrists and primary care docs is that b levels that are in the low range of normal can be associated with psychiatric symptoms , such as depression most lab tests of b will suggest to is normal is probably too low , however , and most people i test are in that range unless they are dedicated liver eaters rare or multivitamin takers the latest practice guidelines for prescribing antidepressants suggests that antidepressants wo n't work as well until the b level is higher than who knows what holob would show ? back to the study ! dementia free finnish participants in the caide study were examined in and serum blood levels of holob , homocysteine , and folate were available in along with mmse scores , and at the follow up several years later , individuals were examined for dementia with the mmse a short , rather crappy test for dementia , and those who scored badly or whose scores decreased significantly from were more closely examined with much better neuropsychologic tests , brain imaging , csf analysis , and blood tests this is yet another observational study , and a basic one , though at least no waters are muddied with dietary pattern adjustments results ! of the folks ended up with alzheimer 's people who developed alzheimer 's were older , had a lower bmi , and higher frequency of the apoe allele they also had lower holob and higher homocysteine compared to subjects without dementia folks with higher homocysteine tended to be older , male , and had lower holob folate another b vitamin whose deficiency is associated with nerve problems , depression , and dementia did n't seem to have much to do with anything my own clinical experience with folate is that no one seems to be low , and supplementing with special bioavailable folate does n't seem to help much the deplin folks should have been powdering grass fed beef liver and putting it into pills , i suppose discussion ! high homocysteine and low holob in showed increasing risk for dementia many years later , independent of other known risk factors , such as age or apoe status in the framingham study and some other long term population observational studies also showed high homocysteine to be a risk factor for later alzheimer 's , dementia , and cognitive impairment what could be going on then , biologically ? high homocysteine levels are associated with low b , endothelial dysfunction , atherosclerosis , and poor nitric oxide activity elevated homocysteine might be a part of beta amyloid generation , cause dna damage , and impair dna repair oh here 's something interesting homocysteine can become homocysteic acid , which is highly neurotoxic and an nmda receptor activator ! some more interesting biochem remember same ? well , vitamin b is desperately needed to add methyl groups to homocysteine to make methionine , and then sam lack of sam is linked to nerve damage , depression , cognitive decline , and dementia well ! a few years ago , it was noticed that low folate levels was associated with high homocysteine and heart disease a number of studies and clinical trials were attempted , and were basically a total bust turns out , maybe it was n't folate after all , but b instead which makes more sense , seeing as how it is relatively easy to be fine in folate levels on a sad , but rather difficult to be replete in b we 're still waiting for the clinical randomized controlled trials of b maybe the answers of the homocysteine mystery will be found there ?
