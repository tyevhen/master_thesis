last night i said to kathleen , kenyon is old and boring whereupon she burst into angry tears and left for the upstairs , where we now have a full size bed i was afraid to sleep with her and did n't she claimed i harped on kenyon 's age , i thought i just mentioned it in trying to clarify my remark this morning , she broke into tears again why are men so stupid ? kenyon is n't boring when we take him swimming , and he was frisky this morning as he danced around kathleen with his favorite sock in his mouth i fear kathleen without a dog and want to get a puppy she feels a puppy would shorten kenyon 's life , displacing him she is always right because it is her dog but kenyon may have another three years , and i dread the day he goes to doggie heaven , as my sweeheart will weep for weeks ca n't be helped , i guess i 've had an awful cold , so bad i needed a chest x ray i did n't see anything serious on the x ray but i 'll wait for the radiologist 's imprimatur what 's so strange is that i know i'm coughing out of my anterior left lung , and recumbency worsens it , and i 've been doing so for two months with various shades of productivity , presently yellow white this means it was time to check for tb from mexico , lymphoma , lung cancer and other delights i 'll have four weeks off the damn cigs monday as will kathleen i hate going to doctors luckily i saw a pa ka ching ! i had to tell him how important i was he told me he knew that i had to know everything wise man strange , i always hated hospitals and clinics , even when i worked in them or managed them i hate the sterility of it all , the implied inhumanity shit , as we have no insurance , they wanted for the chest x ray ! but i get a discount if i pay the bill withing days could illegal immigrants be driving the price up ? hmmm our check from principal is late this month so we are being forced to be sober because we ca n't afford booze i 'd like to cut back on our drinking anyway , but as we so recently achieved smobriety , better one thing at a time , so i'm told just a note for today i'm computer impaired as i left mine at my sister 's like a blockhead you know , last minute , i'm telling myself do n't forget the computer , doc , do n't forget and then i do ! thine , ce
