i 've been doing a lot lately to tackle my anxiety , but it has n't been enough now , with some major life changes looming , i need to ramp up my recovery efforts of course , it 's easy to get caught in the anxiety relief forget mode , in which dealing with anxiety is n't as easy as just trying to forget about it once it passes i'm not talking about attacking my anxious feelings , as i think that mind set can be counterproductive i'm talking about being even more proactive in dealing with this disease on the top of my list is really changing my thinking i trust myself can no longer be just a note on a flashcard i occassionally look at it must be a mantra that i incorporate into the very fiber of my being and there 's no better time to start than right now !
