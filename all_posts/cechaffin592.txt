before i get to today 's post , i want to wish my beloved wife and editor , kathleen mcgovern chaffin , a joyous birthday , and i pray the gift i ordered arrives today ! i have added a link to her poems below left hand margin from a recent feature in mindfire ed gary blankenship , which i encourage you to read , not because it 's her birthday but because she is an outstanding poet who , unfortunately , writes only rarely she is one of the most lyrical poets i know , as her deafness affords her one outlet for her love of music language i would also be remiss if i did not mention that her beloved service dog , kenyon , turned on may here 's one of the many love poems i 've written for kathleen to kathleen , after neruda as the salmon seeks its mother gravel through the lying ions of the sea , i seek you without your body my blankets are cold , the ground hard , my joints uneasy apart , i am a mold for your bronze halved , discarded do you know this hollow ? there is no shame in love daily i embarrass myself , collar strangers , weary my children i am the ancient mariner condemned to speak of you wherever i go have you suffered this ? who am i to compare us ? you are smooth as agate , i am ripsawn wood my heart seeks you like a cyclone i would swallow your farmhouse whole without you i am a one handed magician cheating at solitaire , hoarding coppers ii when will you come to me ? it is already late and my father has closed the drapes i listen for your stride i could never confuse it with another your back is strong as a barge , your legs were sculpted in greece , your hips formed in india , your face sought by raphael your eyes threaten green lightning from the atlantic you could crush me with a word , like a mussel at low tide why do i trust you so utterly ? now back to the anxiety of depression it i feel its cold shadow on my neck when i turn it s gone it keeps track of this it keeps track of everything in a black binder with angstrom thin sheets did mom create it by incessant hovering ? did dad by his necessary domination ? did school create it by forcing comparisons , or did i , by imagining i was important ? it feels like a huge bear behind me , more impatient than malevolent , sniffing the wind for the first hint of failure i try not to disappoint one of the most crippling aspects of typical clinical depression , or melancholia , as opposed to the lethargy of atypical depression , is an overwhelming sense of anxiety it 's as if every tiny decision is one terrible , fatal , final exam emptying a dishwasher can be a horror making a sandwich is like walking a tightwire without a net your hand shakes with the pressure of putting sugar in your coffee you get the picture today 's poem emphasizes that aspect of clinical depression i have found in treating patients that often a depression cannot be reversed unless the anxiety is first controlled , especially since early reactions to antidepressants can lead to an increase in anxiety particularly wellbutrin and effexor in my experience this early effect of antidepressants is also the reason for a window of increased suicide the driving energy of the antidepressant , while the mood is still black , can lead to rash actions the physical stimulation of an antidepressant usually manifests before the patient experiences an improvement in mood , why it 's very important to talk a patient through this transition often a benzodiazapine , such as clonazepam , is beneficial in this transition phase to control anxiety antipsychotics may be needed , but remember they can cause akisthesia , a feeling of ants in one 's pants , which can make the transition even harder lithium is a good adjunct in bipolars , less effective in unipolars , in acute depression , and there are many other adjunctive options , including thyroid supplementation , but to list them would be beyond the scope of this blog all for today , dr chaffin
