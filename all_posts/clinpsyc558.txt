another study white et al in the latest schizophrenia research comparing first and second generation antipsychotics , this time in elderly patients with severe poor outcome schizophrenia , found that there was no difference in their ability to impact positive or negative symptoms over time this goes hand in hand with other trials like this and this that have failed to differentiate the two classes in terms of efficacy yes , i am aware that older antipsychotics induce tardive dyskinesia and other horrendous effects , but the new meds are not exactly a walk in the park when it comes to safety !
