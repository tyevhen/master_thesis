i'm going back to work today i took two days off while attempting to climb out of this black hole in which i 've been consumed actually , i took the time off at the suggestion of my doc she told me monday to take a medical leave , or so i thought , but then yesterday she told me she thought work would be helpful i thought i was doing the right thing turns out i was n't at times like these , i do n't have a clue what the right thing is or is n't so i'm going back to work i'm going back to work today , and i'm scared to death i feel anxious and numb at the same time i do n't know what i have to give to my patients , and they need me to give them something i ca n't be a zombie , but i feel like a zombie my chest hurts there is a familiar ache deep within my soul will i burst into tears when my first patient opens her door ? seems like a definite possibility but i pray that does n't happen i'm going back to work today , and i do n't feel ready but then again , how will i ever know if i am ready ? will i ever feel ready ? i do n't feel ready right now but as my friend bill pointed out yesterday , i do have a history of pulling it together despite my health and that 's what i'm banking on , i guess , that i 'll pull another rabbit out of my hat and get done what needs to be done i do n't know if that 's a good thing or a bad thing ask me at the end of the day i'm hoping to make it at least that far
