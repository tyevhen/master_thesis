i just came in from a gloriously sunny , cool , mile run i felt great it was my second run since finishing the new york city marathon last sunday it was nice to be out on my local , familiar trails running with jet again i missed him a lot while i was gone i loved new york , but it 's nice to be home i'm slowly settling back into my routine the finish line in central park i 've been home from new york for a few days jet and i reunited wednesday evening i returned to work thursday and friday i attended my usual saturday meeting this morning i 've got some leaves to rake and some errands to run , but i'm kind of enjoying simply sitting on my butt right now jet 's napping i may join him soon i enjoyed new york city in the days immediately following the marathon i spent all day monday and tuesday touring the city i'm a huge seinfeld fan , so i checked out some of the familiar television show sites , including tom 's restaurant aka monk 's cafe and the original soupman aka the soup nazi i toured st paul 's chapel near ground zero and the museum i was in the museum hours when i realized i could n't absorb another minute i left despite there being much more to see it was an amazing museum i will go back i also traveled over to brooklyn where i ate at grimaldi 's pizza , which has been honored as the best pizza in new york city it 's located right under the brooklyn bridge , so i took advantage and walked to the top of the bridge , which was pretty cool then i spent much of the day walking along the brooklyn waterfront , where there was a lot of green space and amazing views of the manhattan skyline i took in the sites and sounds of greenwich village late into the night manhattan skyline and brooklyn bridge i'm already thinking about my next marathon i 've got a few tentatively penciled into my schedule , including one in december and one in january unfortunately new york was so spendy , i may not be able to afford the time off or expense of another race for awhile i'm looking at races within driving , albeit long driving , distance i 've definitely got the marathon bug again i do n't want to wait until spring to experience another one thank you , my friends , for your support over these past few years of illness and injury your comments have carried me through some difficult times i am grateful for my new york city experience , and i am so grateful to be back running again i feel i 've reclaimed a huge piece of what makes me , me that 's pretty cool
