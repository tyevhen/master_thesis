i really am struggling i feel kind of bad , because i have recently become aware that there are quite a few local autism moms who read my blog and find it inspirational i don t feel like an inspiration right now , i feel useless i feel like i m doing it all wrong i feel discouraged i feel exhausted this is all about my fear for nathan my limitations when it comes to helping him it s about the fact that at age and a half he is entering his third year of formal schooling it s the memory of that first teacher telling me that i wouldn t recognize nathan in months , that his progress would astound me here i sit still waiting i sat down and really read his iep update from the extended school year last night he is meeting only one of goals receptive language , per the speech pathologist who ironically is the daughter in law of jack s kindergarten teacher the teacher emailed me to tell me how cute her dil thought natey was the biggest issue is consistency even if he does something fabulous , getting him to repeat it is impossible i know this there are days that the words just flow , and then nothing , sometimes for weeks i know what it is it s the noise as i call it he can t focus the need for stimulation is so intense , especially tactile and visual he constantly wants us to squeeze him his arms his legs he will take your hand and place it there if you do it wrong he moves your hand back , as in , try again buster he waves things in front of his face at every opportunity he figured out that our mail is kept on a washstand by the front entrance of the house and has taken to shredding it so that he can dangle the paper in front of his face he has a woody doll that has been getting a lot of attention it s because its arms and legs sway when he puts it in front of his face he goes after toilet paper , paper towels , napkins , leaves , grass , anything that he can dangle in front of his face if none of this is available and god knows i try to keep it away from him he now uses his fingers several people have said oh look he learned to wave i want to smack them and say , no moron , it s stimming once again grace i smile and nod if that s what they need to believe then so be it i don t have that luxury if we could calm the stimming he could make progress i just know it that s why i have tried the diets , the supplements why i haven t given up , why i keep adding them for the past two years to be honest , today i feel like giving up i gave him nothing this morning for the first time in years , and i know it won t matter we still don t have the mitochondrial cocktail , as nate s doctor needs to call it in to the new compounding pharmacy and hasn t yet done so i spent minutes on the phone with him again this morning what was i doing ? reading him what is in the cocktail he wants nate to have because he didn t know remember i m ready to throw my hands up and say never mind ready to give in but something made me make the call to his doctor anyway in the midst of all of the frustration and hopelessness , i found the motivation to call him again , and give him the list yet again and i will give the supplements to nate tonight he missed one dose , big deal i will keep on going even though i am ready to quit and spending more time watching nate with sadness , feeling more grief , than ever before my actions are another reminder to me of the strength of a mother s love for her child all of this work is just an expression of that love and confirmation that love is indeed a verb
