a colleague wrote into our psychiatric society 's listserv his son is starting college and he was solicited to purchase tuition reimbursement insurance in case something goes wrong and his son needs to withdraw he was surprised to read that the company offered one amount if a student withdraws for 'medical' reasons and another , lesser percentage , if the student withdraws for 'mental health' reasons oh , and the medical leave needs a doctor 's note , while a mental health leave requires that the student must have been hospitalized for two consecutive days for the psychiatric condition that seemed outrageous , and it occurred to me that i have a kid in college and i had the same offer for tuition reimbursement insurance sitting in my spam only my offspring is at a different university in a different state and there is no medical vs mental health differentiation for her large university i clicked on a few schools and concluded this was a quirk of my colleague 's son 's institution he was quick to point out that i was wrong colleges and universities are all over the map with this , and i soon realized that every school that offers this policy in maryland has some inequity for mental health reasons either a lesser amount of reimbursement or a requirement for hospitalization i do n't quite understand are they saying that mental illnesses are less real or valid so you have to 'prove' you 're really sick , and by the way , you get less of a refund ? disability of all varieties has the potential to be an individual matter especially when it involves pain or fatigue and in maryland , our governor has set the bar quite high he was recently diagnosed with an aggressive form of lymphoma and is undergoing chemotherapy certainly a good reason to take some time off but his photo minus hair is in the paper every day with his declaration about some topic or other at some level , a doctor of any specialty is left to trust the patient or not when he says he just ca n't do something because he 's in too much pain , too tired , too depressed , or his preoccupation with delusions and hallucinations is getting in the way the company mentioned is dewar you can look up a university they cover here college tuition refund home page , but apparently it 's been an issue for years below i 'll post some articles about the issue from the new york times and psych central it 's disheartening that despite this outcry and confrontation in , dewar continues to have these discriminatory policies i could n't find anything that indicated that nami or apa were part of the conversation , but i could well have missed it please let me know if i have in the comments section on the third article , one person noted that when she complained to yale 's president , then the policy did change to one of equal coverage , but it seems like a war of many small battles which are mostly not being fought in addition , i'm posting a link to an excellent summary about why parity legislation has not resulted in the changes that were hoped for in the nytimes tuition refunds , but not quite on equal terms on psych central sallie mae , markel and dewar discriminate against people with mental illness and more in the nytimes read the comments how tuition refund insurance works at your school and , finally , for anyone interested in an overview of how and why parity is failing , this is an excellent summary , from earlier this month congress tried to fix mental health care in lawsuits charge it is n't working and , no , i do n't want to talk about why the background is green where is roy when i need him ?
