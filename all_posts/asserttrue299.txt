in looking at base composition statistics of codons , an amazing fact jumps out if you look carefully at the following graph , you can see that the cloud of gold colored data points representing the compositional stats for the second base in codons of clostridium botulinum has a second , breakaway cloud underneath it see arrow codon base composition statistics for clostridium botulinum notice the breakaway cloud of gold points under the main cloud arrow these points represent genes in which most codons have a pyrimidine in the middle base of each codon to review i made this plot by going through each dna sequence for each coding cds gene of c botulinum , and for each gene , i went through all codons and calculated the average purine content as well as the average g c content of the bases at a positions one , two , and three in the codons thus , every dot represents the stats for one gene 's worth of data after looking at graphs of this sort , three key facts about codon bases leap out most codons , for most genes , have a purine as the first base notice how the red cloud of points is higher than the others , centering on y the third base often called the wobble base shown blue here has the most extreme g c value this is well known the middle base falls in one of two positions high or low on the purine y axis there 's a primary cloud of data points and a secondary cloud in a distinct region below the main cloud the secondary cloud of gold points is centered at about on the y axis , meaning these are genes in which the second codon base tends to be a pyrimidine the question is what does it mean when you look at a gene with or or codons , and the majority of codons have a pyrimidine in the second base ? if you examine the standard codon translation table below , you can see that codons with a pyrimidine in the second position represented by the first two columns of the table code primarily for nonpolar amino acids when a pyrimidine is in the second base , the possible amino acids are phenylalanine , serine , leucine , proline , isoleucine , methionine , threonine , valine , and alanine of these , all but serine and threonine are nonpolar therefore , a pyrimidine in position two of a codon means there 's at least a chance that the amino acid will have a nonpolar , hydrophobic side group virtually all proteins contain some nonpolar amino acids , but when a protein contains mostly nonpolar amino acids , that protein is destined to wind up in the cell membrane which is largely made up of lipids thus , we can expect to find that genes in the breakaway cloud of gold points in the graph further above represent membrane associated proteins to check this hypothesis , i wrote a script that harvested the gene names , and protein product names , of all the breakaway cloud data points after purging genes annotated unhelpfully as hypothetical protein , i was left with known genes they 're shown in the following table gene product clc arsenical

represents a membrane associated protein transporters , carrier proteins , permeases , etc i ran the same experiment on genes from streptomyces griseus strain xylbkg and came up with genes having high pyrimidine content in base two all genes specify membrane associated proteins the full list is in a table below the bottom line base two of codons acts as a binary switch if the base is a pyrimidine , the associated amino acid will most likely chance be nonpolar if the base is a purine , the codon will either be a stop codon out of codons or the amino acid will be polar out of codons here 's the
