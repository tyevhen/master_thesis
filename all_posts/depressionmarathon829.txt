ugh ! i woke up this morning with a sore throat , runny nose , achy muscles and joints i felt like crap i still feel like crap feeling like crap makes me crabby i do n't like being sick , and i do n't like being crabby , but today i was both i'm sure i was quite pleasant to be around i'm also cranky because i missed my workouts as a result of feeling like crap i'm not a fan of missing my workouts either , but you probably could have guessed that one it was smarter that i did n't go while feeling ill , but it still bugs me to miss them anyway , enough complaining on to gratitude i'm extremely grateful to be at bill and cindy 's house again , and at supper time , too ! and they invited me despite the fact that i'm sick ! with their company and bill 's cooking , i 'll likely be all better by morning i 'll probably have more to say then , too
