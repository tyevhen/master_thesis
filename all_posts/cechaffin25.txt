that is , beating up myself when my mind has nothing to occupy it , which is frequently i have seemingly exhausted what western medicine has to offer days at a university hospital with maximum meds , group therapy and treatments of bilateral ect with the current turned up to the max my brain could tolerate early on in this disease , as a christian fanatic , i was sure that my overwhelming depressions were due to god' desertion , to a failure of faith that model failed miserably next i embraced the medical model that seems to have worked for near years but it has failed to work now thus i have entered therapy again , cognitive behavioral therapy , but after two sessions see no light at the tunnel 's end sometimes i think if i could just forget about myself and stick my nose in as many mundane tasks as feasible , from cleaning my desk to weed whacking , that i might improve in the past , however , frantic work did not improve my overall mood i'm open to anything now , eastern or western , however irrational it appears on the surface the old word for depression was sloth or accidie , a certain torpor of spirit and withdrawal from the world of this i am guilty but to treat this behavior as a moral failure seems cruel nevertheless christian theology holds , for the most part , that despair is a form of pride , as it usurps the hope of god and the faith that our experience will somehow redound to his glory i am so far removed from such an attitude it 's not funny and i have n't written poetry in six months furthermore , i must warn folks about my blog from until the end of december , when i became fully manic and entered a fantasy detour where i thought i could save the world i leave it as evidence of the flip side of my disease , and as a record of a creative psychosis it may entertain some in my depression i cannot even save myself thank god for my wife , kathleen , who helps keep me on the planet i am so grateful for her and for my family and friends they believe in me when i cannot oh to believe in myself again ! oh to have an innate sense of self again ! i have felt the need to apologize for my mania , recorded here as mentioned above , but such an impulse is ridiculous since i had no control over it to begin with , just as i am now snake bit by a serious depression again perhaps the psychological model will help me it never has before but i'm desperate i 'll close with one of the dark sonnets i wrote during the first half of , when i was also suffering a serious depression though not as serious as this one , i fear , where i feel global paralysis and abject but unfocused fear what do i fear ? depression how shall i overcome it ? i have no clue , but just blogging today is one tiny step forward dark sonnet xxvii i fear disintegration into glass , into a million cubes orbiting free , reflecting only scenery as they pass , without a central hub , without a me the ego is a very slippery boss few know the limits of his sour purview i know the limits he is what i ve lost all whirls in a pestilential stew a piece of me there , another here who will collect the fragments in a pot ? another year , another half a year where what i thought i was is what i m not dear brother , if your self escapes your skull , pray you do not spiral down to null namaste , kilorats , craig
