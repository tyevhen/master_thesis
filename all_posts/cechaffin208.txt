net poets , happy alcoholic in bumbershoot good fridays in astropoetica after reading the latter half of the fourth edition of the norton anthology of poetry in barefoot muse in print i 'll have a poem on the front cover and an interview on the back cover of the new sigurd journal their website does n't yet feature content but it does accept submissions two of the journals paid ! hoo hoo ! enough for two big bottles of cheap vodka it 's the principal that counts i 'll invest it in my brain , like the happy alcoholic above lazy sunday golden fields of early summer sudden spent grass , exploding darts of dandelions , the wild radishes in patches , lavender and white , the bark of sea lions and the ocean 's engine running in the background and i have nothing to say which is also the title of a poem of mine published i forget where but written in long beach , ca nothing to say i have nothing needful to say , no comment on the glittering bay or the dark , snow topped wall of the san gabriels things used to be pulled from me , uprooted like weeds from a garden i let the weeds bloom now the red throated bird that lives in my chipped balcony light sings for a mate i have never seen i let my words run like watercolors time runs only forward why should art be different ? here is the last line i may have posted this before but i could think of nothing else to do except , perhaps , to look up abulia again , no sure thing lazing on a sunday afternoon , kilobunnies , craig erick
