i have been neglecting my blog because of an amazon com contest for a first novel , for which they are receiving entries a friend told me about this , a friend who dedicated himself , though a realtor , to producing a novel in a matter of weeks for the contest i haven t checked back with him i really don t want to be asked to read his output , though i m sure its genius is unrivaled that s a lot of chutzpah on his part there are people who can write well at that pace , like the prolific joyce carol oates , but i don t think life as a realtor is the best preparation if he wins i ll kill myself so i got through a third draft and began a fourth draft largely incomplete of the abomination before today , the day i must mail the ms and a , word excerpt to amazon in the revision process the book has been cut from , words to , , roughly , which i take as a good sign for sustaining interest the book relies heavily on character , although the plot includes four murders and some science fiction and religious mumbo jumbo meanwhile the edwin mellen press has agreed to look at my t s eliot ms also , an editor from a paying magazine solicited poems from me and took two out of three so things are looking up it s hard for an artist to dissociate his self esteem from his work , but i try my psychological defense against failure is very primitive i belittle my work and give it no chance to succeed thus i prevent disappointment by already being disappointed still i can t help feeling my little heart go bumpety bump to know some oxford professor will be taking my eliot ms seriously in other news , the friend i recovered at rachel s memorial service has been plying me eloquently with the neglected news of christians' contributions to art and civilization he bragged that the christian monasteries kept the classics alive for the renaissance i said why didn t the dumb monks read the books and start a renaissance ? he 's wonderful debater and writer and rhetorical cheat , and i ve enjoyed our interchanges thoroughly , just as the resumption of our friendship has been the one good thing that came out of rachel s death for me as daughter sarah says , though already bitten by the chaffin black humor bug , and all i got was this car mushrooming season has started the other night i smothered kathleen s pot roast in honey mushrooms , and the result was heavenly nothing like fresh mushrooms for delicate spicing and good gravy one of these nights we ll eat all wild abalone , wild mushrooms and a salad of local leaves but i ll have to add rice i like rice or potatoes with nearly every dinner that is n't soup and although i may be accused of blasphemy in the matter , i prize potatoes over macaroni and cheese as well as meatloaf as the ultimate comfort food and there 's no german or irish in me i m at kiloneutral today i still don t feel as if the ground is absolutely solid beneath my feet , but for someone who just endured a depression for a year and a half , this is not surprising i may never feel the ground is solid again i know i can fall victim to bad chemicals at any time still , the background threat of groundlessness , as buddhists call it , also increases my gratefulness for every moment i m not depressed funny how that works kiloneutral , ce
