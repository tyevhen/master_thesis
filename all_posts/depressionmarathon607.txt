going up ? maybe it 's hard to say i 've given up trying to figure it out instead i'm focused on staying on the ride i'm strapped in my butt is firmly planted in the seat it 's a temporary ride , as one of my readers reminded me , and i just need to hang on hanging on tight , i am i 've been doing what i need to do work has been extremely busy lately , which is good , although my low mood made it a bit more challenging fortunately , work also provided a distraction from the darkness i may not have been quite as efficient over the past couple days , but i saw to the needs of all of my patients nonetheless i 've got some really neat people on my caseload , and they certainly help me keep life in perspective with my mood being so off , i 've let a lot of things slide away from work my house , for example , needs some assistance it 's a mess cleaning , laundry , vacuuming , and dusting all await my response my front yard needs to be raked still i'm lucky it has n't snowed and puck is a constant reminder that i need to keep moving if not for my sake , for his perhaps today will allow me to address at least one of these concerns one thing at a time , one day at a time that 's where i'm focused i'm riding the rollercoaster i'm strapped in and hanging on tight soon , i expect the bumps will smooth and the coaster will slowly roll to a nice , quiet stop i'm looking forward to that
