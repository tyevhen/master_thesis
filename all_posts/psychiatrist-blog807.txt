sometimes in my real life it becomes obvious that a friend or acquaintance is having a problem either they are wearing obvious signs of mental illness or they just show signs of being 'stuck' in life or , worse , of moving backwards often they do n't see it i suppose there is the outsider 's vantage point of making a judgment that may reflect my own value system and not their reality to me , i may see someone who has family and job and connections who sees leaving those things as a healthy escape and their withdrawal as a good kind of comfort with keeping their own company usually these are n't my close friends , but what do you do when you notice that someone in your life is changing and might possibly benefit from help ? in general , i 've found that you need help is not helpful people hear this as an insult , not as a kind suggestion from a concerned friend and from a psychiatrist friend it may be worse and easier to blow off shrinks think everyone 's crazy , they push drugs , they think everyone needs therapy , they see the world in a skewed way at least this is how the commercial runs so i wondered how do people let their friends know they need help in a way that inspires them to get it in the absence of a crisis ? if you 're in treatment because someone else suggested it , what enabled you to hear the suggestion without being wounded or insulted ?
