okay , it is a done deal my doctor has agreed to let me try dutasteride to see if it will work i will pick up the prescription tomorrow i plan on keeping track of any positive and negative experiences and will report to you occasionally on my findings unfortunately , since there is no generic substitute , it is expensive however , if it could slow the progression or improve my strength , it would be worth it for several years i have taken a wait and see attitude this is my first venture into the world of potential treatments my logic appears to be sound or desperate since there is not clinical trial on the near horizon and , if , on average , we lose of our strength each year and , if , on average , the clinical trial group taking the drug did see a improvement in strength and , if i do not experience any negative side effects and , if i am one of the fortunate ones that the drug works on then , it is a win for me ! that is a lot of if 's , but very few things are a certainty in life it appears , from reading the clinical trial results , that the worst case scenario would be that dutasteride does not work for me it would be disappointing news , but i least i gave it my best shot only time will tell and it appears that time is what is needed to truly test the drug
