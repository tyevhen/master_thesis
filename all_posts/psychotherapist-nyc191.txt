in an earlier article , movies years an old secret haunts a loving long term marriage , i discussed how events from the distant past upend a long term marriage causing the wife to feel suddenly that she really did n't know her husband or understand their marriage until then , they had been , seemingly , going along happily betrayal coping with the sudden feeling that you do n't really know your spouse as i mentioned in my prior article one of the things that makes this movie so powerful is that this is the sort of thing that happens in many relationships if it 's happening to you , you can feel that you 're the only couple going through it because , similar to the couple in years , couples often do n't talk about these issues aside of their relationship or their couples therapy if you 're experiencing a betrayal in your relationship , aside from the shock , you can feel very alone in your experience the betrayal can make you ask yourself who is this person that i'm married to ? you can also question your marriage this can be extremely disturbing and leave you reeling , especially in a long term relationship where , prior to the betrayal , you thought you understood your spouse well and you felt confident in your marriage in prior articles , i 've written about infidelity see my articles your relationship your spouse cheated on you should you stay or should you go ? and coping with infidelity in your relationship but infidelity is not the only form of betrayal that couples often go through the following vignette , which is a fictionalized example of many different cases with all identifying information changed , i discuss another form of betrayal in a long term relationship donna and jim donna and jim came to couples counseling because they were struggling to overcome donna 's sudden realization that jim had gambled away their life savings see my article compulsive gambling beware of march madness they were married for years , until jim 's secret gambling problem emerged , donna felt content and secure in their relationship jim worked as a stockbroker and donna worked as an executive assistant until recent events unfolded , donna was unaware of any serious problems in their relationship jim took care of their finances , so donna was unaware that there was any problem until she came across a bank statement that jim had accidentally left out and she saw that their savings was a fraction of what she had always known it to be alarmed , donna approached jim with the statement to show him what she thought was a bank error but when he hung his head down and averted her gaze , she felt queasy and knew something was terribly wrong over the next hour , jim broke down in tears and confessed to donna that he had been secretly gambling in the last several years and he had depleted their savings he apologized to her over and over again , but donna was in a state of shock trying to come to terms with what she was hearing donna described how she suddenly felt like the floor under her feet had dropped away and she was falling into an abyss she was so upset that she could barely understand what jim was telling her she felt like she was in a bad dream and any moment she was going to wake up and feel relieved but , as the hours passed , she realized that this was no dream and her shocked turned to rage she told jim to stay at his parents' home for the time being so she could wrap her mind around what was happening during the days that jim was away , donna felt lonelier that she had ever felt she could n't bear to tell her family or close friends what had just happened at that point , she could n't even bear to tell her daughters all the while , donna felt like she was going through the motions in her life it was as if everything looked the same , but nothing felt the same she felt like her every day life had been replaced by replicas of people and things that she ordinarily knew nothing seemed real all of this time , she could never have imagined that jim had a gambling problem or that he was gambling away their savings the thoughts that kept going around in her mind were who is this man that i thought i knew for all of these years ? does he really love me ? how could he do this ? what is our marriage about if he could be so dishonest and ruin us in this way ? how can i ever trust him again ? initially , donna considered divorce and told jim that she did n't think they could ever overcome this betrayal but jim begged donna for forgiveness and pleaded with her to reconsider and not give up on their marriage after several weeks of trying to talk it out between them to no avail , jim sought out couples counseling as a last resort , and donna agreed reluctantly to give it a try after a couple of sessions , donna agreed to stick it out in couples counseling to see if they could work out their problems she was still deeply hurt and upset but , after the initial shock wore off , she realized that she still loved jim and she did n't want to give up their marriage she also realized that he had a serious problem and he needed help she was still very angry , but less so than she had initially been betrayal coping with the sudden feeling that you do n't really know your spouse clearly , finding out about jim 's gambling problem was traumatic for donna , especially since she grew up in a household where her father was a gambler with devastating consequences for her family she had always vowed to herself that she would never marry a gambler and to find out about jim 's secret reopened old emotional wounds related to her father 's gambling jim agreed to attend his own individual therapy with a therapist who specialized in addiction he also began to attend gambler 's anonymous regularly and obtained a sponsor on a practical level , jim had to borrow money from his family , which meant that he had to reveal his gambling problem to them donna took over the finances because , at that point , she did n't trust jim with their money coping with betrayal in your relationship on an emotional level , they had a steep road to climb to repair their relationship jim acknowledged that he had been deceitful and seemed genuinely remorseful over time , donna realized , in hindsight , that there had been signs of jim 's secrecy that she chose to ignore eventually , she attended gam anon , which are self help meetings for spouses or family members of gamblers over the next two years , with much difficulty , donna and jim reconciled their relationship jim discovered in his own individual therapy that , on an unconscious level , he wanted to be found out although it appeared that he had accidentally left the statement out , he realized that he felt so guilty and worried about his secret that he wanted donna to know , but he did n't know how to tell her jim also discovered what triggered his craving to gamble , and he learned to develop better coping skills he also changed careers because his job as a stockbroker was not conducive to overcoming his gambling problem after they completed couples counseling , donna entered into her own individual therapy to deal with the aftermath of jim 's betrayal as well as her own unresolved issues regarding her father as time went on and jim abstained from gambling , the family became closer again having gone through this traumatic event in their lives , donna and jim seemed to grow as a couple and as individuals conclusion there can be many forms of betrayal in a relationship the fictionalized scenario presented in this article illustrates many of the stages that a couple can go through when a betrayal comes to light in the scenario presented above , the couple got help in couples counseling and decided to remain together of course , this is not always the case but after the initial shock of a betrayal , many couples decide to try to reconcile their relationship in couples counseling often , couples who come to couples counseling learn new things about themselves as individuals and as a couple they often learn that they are more resilient than they thought they were a couples counselor wo n't tell you whether or not to stay together see my article your relationship should you stay or should you go ?
