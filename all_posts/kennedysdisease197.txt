in the september october aaa going places magazine there was an excellent article by sandy klim called , what happens if the unexpected occurs ? i recommend that you take the time to read this article because it could make a difference when something does happen as the article mentions , compiling and copying all of this information can seem daunting , but imagine the alternative your family would have to piece together all this information within days without your in depth knowledge the best bet is to gather this information and update it annually , store it in a safe place , and continue to enjoy life it could be years or even decades before someone needs to access your emergency file , but in the event something does happen , you ll have made the transition easier for the ones you love as i read the article , i reviewed where my information was and found that everything was were i thought it was , but could someone else easily gain access to all the information when it was needed and i was not there i needed to become better organized and then let my wife and our executor know where the original documents are , contact information , etc the basic documents that you should have in your emergency file are up to date health insurance policies advance directives can include a living will do not resuscitate dnr order durable power of attorney for health care a current and valid copy of your wills a copy of your organ donor card if you intend to donate an organ copies of the following documents birth certificates marriage license divorce decrees social security cards mortgages and deeds registration and titles for vehicles owned family and friends contact list clear wishes in regards to cremation , burial , religious ceremonies , and other memorial arrangements headstones , markers , donations in lieu of flowers , etc copies of life insurance policies copies of k and ira account information a listing of financial and investment account information other than those shown above checking savings cds outstanding loans religious or spiritual affiliation and contact information if desired the article mentions that this file can be stored in a fireproof safe at home , with your attorney , in a safe deposit box , or with a loved one not living in your home i do have a concern of storing some of the information in a safe deposit box or with your attorney because emergencies do not always occur during banking hours if you have copies of the information with the original documents stored at one of these two locations , it would help the key is letting those close to you know where the files are at and who has permission to access the files of course , those of us living with kennedy 's disease might also want to include information on kennedy 's disease , anesthesia information , tissue donation forms should that be your wish and a contact list for doctors has the article forgotten anything else that needs to be included in this emergency file ?
