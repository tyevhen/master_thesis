when we say that the u s is a wealthy country , what exactly does that mean ? typically , people are referring to per capita gdp , but that 's an income measure , not a wealth measure let 's talk wealth measures it may surprise you to know that the average household net worth in the u s as of was , that 's pretty sizable in fact , it 's so sizable , you 're probably saying to yourself really ? where 's my , ? this shows the folly of talking about averages if you put americans chosen at random into a room , their average net worth is likely to be near zero , because for every person who has a little home equity built up , there 's someone else whose house is below water , and we all know the average american has very little cash in the bank we 're not a nation of savers but if bill gates suddenly walks into that same room , everyone 's average net worth becomes million , because gates has a net worth of billion so here 's a more nuanced view of what 's going on wealth in the u s click to enlarge the chart which comes from this report says that as of , the poorest of americans owned of the country 's wealth , while the top owned of all wealth from to , the bottom saw two thirds of their wealth disappear going from to , while the top saw its share go from to an increase of the top saw its wealth go up over a third of america 's wealth is concentrated in the hands of the top , and that number continues to rise of course , on a global basis the picture is even starker , because so much of the world is poor currently , the top globally own more than of all wealth in the world , and it appears inevitable that the top will soon own the majority of the world 's wealth , if they do n't already but back to the original question how wealthy is the united states ? here , we can talk about public sector wealth we , the people government wealth or private sector wealth thomas piketty presents the statistics in his book capital in the twenty first century the bottom line is that public sector wealth is near zero because the total value of all government holdings including all public property , government buildings , airports , railways , highways , military bases , weapons systems , etc , plus cash on hand and gold in fort knox is almost exactly counterbalanced by the national debt the only net wealth in america is private wealth equal to about four years of gdp , and as we 've seen , that 's in the hands of relatively few people presidential candidates , please discuss tired of lies and half truths about mental illness ? arm yourself with some facts check out my free book mental health myths debunked tons of info , tons of live links , lots of straight talk about depression , suicide , meds , therapy , psychiatry , mental health trends , statistics , and more and you know me , i call bullshit on bogus ideas then give urls to the actual data , so you can weigh the evidence for yourself the idea that antidepressants take weeks to do anything ? myth most people benefit from antidepressants ? myth antidepressants separate from placebo in clinical trials ? largely myth half the trials show separation half do n't electroshock therapy is safe and effective ? bigtime myth ect is dangerous and consent forms are based on obsolete data but do n't take my word for it read the science for yourself it 's all laid out with references in the book download epub or pdf now at noisetrade tell a friend please retweet this post 's url in the meantime , i want to thank the following people for retweeting me yesterday have you added your name to our mailing list ? also please visit hackyourdepression com when you have a chance , and share that link with someone you know who might be suffering from anxiety or depression
