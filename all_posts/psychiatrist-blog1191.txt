wow ! thank you all for the great novel suggestions first , i'm going to tell you some of my favorites , then i'm going to print your comments below in no particular order the kite runner maybe my all time favorite book ? lying on the couch by a shrink about a shrink , quick read i know this much is true starts with a man in a library cutting off his own arm , lots of psychiatric issues middlesex a novel about gender identity in a young woman who begins masculinizing at puberty great read of human bondage a classic about obsessive love the poisonwood bible blink outliers both by malcomn gladwell neither are novels , both are great reads the orchid thief also not a novel , but i was pages into it before i realized i was n't reading fiction the namesake and then you have to read the overcoat snowflower and the secret fan waiting atonement a gesture life i loved this native speaker life of pi the white tiger out stealing horses god of small things three cups of tea somehow i never got into it and as a kid , i loved kurt vonnegut so it was fun to see him on the list in our comments below and my pic for the moment was shadow in the wind reader recommendations have you read i love you , beth cooper by larry doyle ? doyle used to write for the simpsons tv show and beth cooper is a funny book along those lines intelligent but lighthearted perfect for anyone who needs some un brooding grab the paperback edition for extra laughs the back pages are filled with true high school horror stories i wish you good reading just start alexander mccall smith 's hilarious the no ladies' detective agency series , whose protagonist precious is an amateur detective in botswana who snoops and fixes her neighbors' business you will laugh out loud , but her comments on character and motivation are pretty universal in application wonderful characters one in the series describes a woman searching for her supposedly straying husband who , it turns out , has been eaten by a crocodile while being baptized in the river by an evangelical sect smith grew up in africa it 's light reading but good other possibilities cold comfort farm by stella gibbons i saw something nasty in the wood shed is the most famous line i capture the castle by dodie smith cool eccentric and tragic british family in the s for a real brooding downer but good there 's always malcolm lowry 's under the volcano the world was always within the binoculars of the police current favorites shusako endo and nobel laureate jose saramago i agree with anon 's recommendation of snow flower the secret fan , catherine 's time traveler 's wife and dragonfly 's the book thief i just started a thousand splended suns by the author of the kite runner outlander series by diana gabaldon right now there are volumes you will be sucked in i'm also in the middle of middlesex mentioned above and it is a good read , too pure escapism ? try anything by neil gaiman i loved neverwhere and american gods , and could n't read them fast enough his other books are great , too pure fluff ? i 'd try any of the speedy motors series the first of which is the no ladies detective agency by alexander mccall smith anything by david sederis his books must be fiction anything by sue hubble essays about science but waiting for aphroditie is my favorite curious incident although i firmly believe that a spot of bother , his newer one , is far better never let me go i absolutely loved this oryx and crake fantastic too , but preferred the handmaid 's tale pharmakon maybe a little close to home psych wise , but fantastic novel about family with elements of thriller and the history of psychopharmacology rough music notes on an exhibition friendly fire all by patrick gale simply my favourite author , and his books are both devastatingly sensitive , and infinitely powerful at least when it comes to describing the trials of family life free food for millionaires by min jin lee my friends and i have all loved this call me by your name by andre aciman romantic , heart wrenching , escapist puts into words the often bizarre feelings that we 've all experienced about another person , romantically , at some point full of longing and mediterranean summer heat case histories by kate atkinson the first of the jackson brodie novels a series of truly intriguing mysteries , all involving jackson brodie , the only literary detective i have ever really warmed to , or see as anything more than one dimensional what was lost by catherine o'flynn this is one of the books i buy people as a gift this story is so tragic , so involving and so funny , it 's almost impossible that the author managed to combine all this into one book , but it is absolutely fantastic others i recommend wicked by gregory maguire you must have heard of the musical that was based on this book ? this book , is much darker and deeper than the show , but just as wonderful the poisonwood bible by barbara kingsolversp ? i read this over a very hot summer in my younger years and i felt the heat of the congo resonate with the heat of my summer have n't gone back to it in ages , but i loved it then middlesex by jeffrey eugenides greek hermaphrodite saga does it get better ? shadow of the wind , carlos ruiz zafon a great read the book thief marcus zusak or we need to talk about kevin by lionel shriver both stayed with me after reading them never let me go kazuo ishiguro remains of the day kazuo ishiguro tam lin pamela dean the wild swans peg kerr three cups of tea greg mortenson persepolis graphic novel marjane satrapi time traveler 's wife audrey niffenegger in the land of invisible women a female doctor 's journey in the saudi kingdom qanta ahmed a long and fatal love chase louisa may alcott welcome to the monkeyhouse kurt vonnegut i also agree with the suggestions for oryx crake , snowflower , and the curious incident try anything by anita shreve if you 're looking for something girly , anything by jennifer weiner is good i really liked little earthquakes and right now i'm reading certain girls and i'm totally caught up in it if you want something to take you out of this world i would try reading tamora pierce , she writes children 's young adult fantasy and even as an adult i love it it 's my comfort reading i 'd recommend starting with alanna the first adventure or first test it 's all nights and magic and fun there 's also the mists of avalon by marion zimmer bradley if you like camelot type books and of course , madeline l'engle is always good if you 're looking for something with suspense , i recommend reading arthur hailey they 're older books so the context is a little out of date , but i can never put them down same thing with michael crichton , for him , i recommend the andromeda strain i loved these the kite runner by khaled hosseini gives a wonderful look into the mind of an immigrant from a strife tron country lots of action , lots of introspection , guilt , atonement the curious incident of the dog in the night time by mark haddon if you read this you can combine psychiatry with reading a novel the narrator is autistic and goes about solving a murder mystery light fun reading snow flower and the secret fan by lisa see engrossing tale from a female perspective of life in th century china wonderfully rich descriptions the joy luck club by amy tan maybe everyone has already read this , but if you have n't this is a ca n't put it down novel intertwining modern chinese american life with historic chinese life , culture the hidden life of dogs by elizabeth marshal thomas for dog lovers only this is not a novel , but reads like one , if you love dogs marley and me by john grogan for dog lovers only this is autobiographical not a novel , but funny and light except for the ending heart warming oryx and crake by margaret atwood old man 's war by john scalzi world war z an oral history of the zombie war i just finished time and again by jack finney it mixes history and time travel , and i loved it for something lighter and brighter , i go to terry pratchett a mixture of fantasy humor social commentary spirits need lifting ?
