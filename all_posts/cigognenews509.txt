not everyone can go into a hypnotic trance , salivate at the sight of imaginary fudge , or be hypnotically transported into the past for those who can go into a hypnotic trance , there is great variation in the depth and type of trance manifested what produces a trance in the first place ? what accounts for what occurs during the trance and for variations in it ? furthermore , how to explain age regression and so called past lives regression in hypnosis subjects ? it seems to be a matter of the giving of suggestion and the degree of responsiveness to suggestion , also known as suggestibility in hypnosis , suggestion refers to statements made by the hypnotist intended to influence the hypnotic subject the most obvious of these are the suggestions used to induce the hypnotic trance itself suggestion is also the basis of a hypnosis subject 's belief that hypnotism can help him in some way suggestibility is defined by yapko , a leading hypnotherapist , as an openness to accepting new ideas , new information it refers to a person 's capacity to be influenced by another person , that person 's words , or by hypnotic techniques employed in the ongoing controversy within the psychotherapeutic community over the retrieval of repressed memories of childhood abuse , suggestibility is central to the question of how to distinguish between a real memory and a pseudo memory which may have been elicited , implanted , or suggested by a psychotherapist in a study , robert a baker showed how easily most normal human subjects can be hypnotized as well as persuaded to remember their prior incarnations sixty undergraduates were hypnotized with the intent of age regressing them to previous lifetimes they were divided into three groups of each prior to being hypnotized , members of each group had been told they were participating in a study of relaxation and had listened to taped suggestions either supportive of or condemning the idea of past lives therapy of the group exposed to supportive comments , of later reported returning to another life while under hypnosis of the group members exposed to a taped message which ridiculed past lives therapy , only two did so in discussing this study , baker came to a number of conclusions if subjects expected to have a past life experience , they did , and if they did not expect to have one , they did not the idea of having lived before seems both appealing and powerful most hypnosis subjects are highly suggestible and easily influenced by the hypnotist 's tone of voice , manner , and attitudes and rather than evidencing the reality of reincarnation , past lives regression is the result of suggestions made by the hypnotist , expectations held by the subjects , and the demand characteristics of the hypnoidal relationship suggestion is the hypnotherapist 's principal tool suggestibility on the part of the subject makes him open to the hypnotist 's suggestive ideas in the absence of suggestibility , a hypnotist cannot induce a trance , much less utilize the trance state for specific ends using suggestion to induce a hypnotic trance while the neurological and psychological mechanisms responsible for a successful response to suggestion are not yet established scientifically though we may surmise what they are , as discussed below , the external effects of suggestion can be validly described the hypnotized individual appears to heed only the communications of the hypnotist he seems to respond in an uncritical , automatic fashion , ignoring all aspects of the environment other than those made relevant by the hypnotist apparently with no will of his own , he sees , feels , smells , and tastes in accordance with the suggestions in apparent contradiction to the stimuli that impinge upon him even memory and awareness of self may be altered by suggestion , and the effects of the suggestions may be extended post hypnotically into subsequent waking activity hypnosis is supposedly induced by the giving of suggestion because of this , much ado has been made in the last several decades over discovering and developing efficient hypnotic induction techniques of the leading hypnosis researchers , only barber believes hypnotic induction procedures are irrelevant the more common belief is that the techniques play an important role in establishing rapport with the subject , which in turn affects how responsive the subject is to the hypnotist 's later suggestions ordinary hypnotic inductions begin with simple suggestions for relaxation that are easily accepted and acted upon by the subject you are falling into a deep sleep is the suggestion which most readily comes to mind , with the subject 's eyes focused on a shiny object dangling from a string and swinging back and forth in the study on past life regression mentioned above , the induction procedure began with the subject being told to fix his gaze on a spot above a ceiling lamp , while it was suggested that a warm light globe in the center of his head was moving slowly and systematically through his body , warming and relaxing the muscles and melting the tension as it moved once relaxation is evident , the hypnotist attempts to deepen the hypnotic trance , such as by suggesting increasing distortions in perception and memory for example , an earlier suggestion to the subject that your eyelids are becoming heavier and heavier until they finally close , may now become a challenge suggestion than your eyelids are shutting tight tighter tighter you cannot open them even if you try the next step is utilization , or using suggestion to make the subject do certain things or be transported in a certain direction , such as to regress him into his own past perhaps the hypnotist says , i want you to go back in your mind , back to a time long ago , when you first rode a bicycle , keep going back and back and back and so on in one approach to inducing age regression , known as the television technique , the subject is told to imagine a tv screen in his mind on which he will soon see a recording of an event in his life long ago he will also be able to stop the picture if he wants , reverse or fast forward the event , and zoom in on particular details in order to prolong a desired hypnotic effect , the hypnotist may give post hypnotic suggestions for the subject to respond to at a later time post hypnotic suggestion usually combines amnesia with the suggestion so that when the person later responds to the suggestion he has no conscious understanding of why he is doing so for example , the subject may have been instructed to re enter a trance state whenever he sees the hypnotist scratch his chin , wherever and whenever that may occur erickson reported many a subject or patient lapsing into a trance state upon encountering him at a later date sometimes involving several years in some unexpected social situation such as a conference or a cocktail party yapko , m d ,
