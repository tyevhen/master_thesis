i'm in the midst of an anniversary of sorts it was one year ago this week that i entered the hospital for the first time at that moment i had no idea i was about to embark on what would end up being the worst depression relapse i 'd ever have i ended up surviving through five hospitalizations between october and mid december i went through unsuccessful ect treatments that left my memory so impaired i could barely remember my friends' names my mother had to fly up from her winter home in the southern us to take care of me because i was barely able to move , much less take care of myself or jet when my mom was n't here , my friend wendy opened her home to jet and i she and her family provided us safe shelter , companionship , food , and assistance i was then , and remain today , forever grateful depression sucks my depression has been unpredictable , debilitating , and life threatening this past year was a particularly tough one i'm grateful today to be battling and surviving i'm doing well right now , although i still feel like i'm on shaky ground but i 'll take shaky ground over underground any day today i'm continuing to move ahead rather than look behind i'm looking forward to spending time with d and running the chicago marathon in a little over a week i'm taking care of business at home , working , running , keeping my house , and being a mom to jet i'm doing life on life 's terms , and that 's the best i can do , illness or not
