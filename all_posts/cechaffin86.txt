i was castigated by one sissy t for not continuing this blog , even though her comment was below a post from ca n't please all people in all times , as lost and star trek both of which i highly recommend have taught us j j abrams , producer of both , seems to have solved that old conundrum you can meet yourself in the past because you 're adult self is on a different timeline forget the math it adds to the drama btw , i bought a cheap webcam and here 's my first recording moodwise i 've been sketchy i 've had a lot of weeping spells at my usual witching hour , am , though only once in the last three days and with that emotion comes the cacophonous recitations of demons you 're no good you 're worthless why exist ? you 're a burden and blah , blah , blah among the mood disordered , this is the chicken and egg question for severe mood disorders like mine , the affect or emotion always precedes the negative thoughts thus to improve my thoughts i must improve my mood , not the other way around cognitive behavioral therapy is more helpful is lesser cases , i think in other words positive thinking has never helped me out of a depression and never will i can't have positive thinking with an overwhelmingly bad mood i think that that 's the first time i 've used capitals on this blog although i will not admit being more than three kilorats down , to give you an idea of where my head has been , here 's a dark poem from a dark mind dark christ i i kissed the thin lips of the black jesus of depression ignominiously tacked to a rough hewn cross his eyes stared blankly , black marbles in white his loincloth had a gold band to match his yellow hair on his black wrists blood was barely visible i wanted to fall at his feet but his eyes were fixed at some insensible point beyond any horizon , some future judgment perhaps of the cockroach called man i knelt and pawed at his ankles in hopeless supplication blood dried on my hands but he never looked down larger than death he hung never accusing me but staring , staring at a point beyond any point , his face lost to man how could my salvation be so eclipsed ? what did i owe him ? he owed me nothing all was dark save his hair and why blond ? an attempt at a halo ? ii in those three hours he agonized , separated from every good ever authored by the smallest angel sent by the father , bereft , without heft or substance , an entire negation of carbon based life staring , staring at a point beyond points there was no room for man so i threw my salvation down like a piece of bloody obsidian and like the disciples had no faith in the resurrection , the ultimate betrayal see ? it 's not the kind of art you want to hang on a hotel wall , much less your refrigerator but i think it 's powerful , and it 's rare i'm fairly happy with a near first draft as a docent i lead lots of tours through the mendocino coast botanical gardens , which i highly recommend i'm most gratified when i get elementary school children and i can show them how a flower is both a girl and a boy talk about narcissism ! self pollinators , obviously not catholic i have now successfully withdrawn from m s contin , a long acting form of morphine i 've taken for my neck and back i have sneezing , loose stools and a great tiredness , but i know it will pass i do feel a little clearer , which was my goal and i 've rarely smoked since april , so withdrawal from narcotics and nicotine , quoth my shrink , might have something to do with my recent dip ? or was it the unconscious memory of my two year depression that began on april , ? i 've had less than a year of normal mood since but i am so grateful for it , when pancakes taste good and the blue jays shine and flowers explode like popcorn , yes this incredibly variegated world in which we live , the small blue flower by the roadside whose name you 'll never know before closing i 'd like to share a new link to an interview with me in mydepressionconnection unlike the romantic blog interviews , this one focuses on the manic depressive aspect of my work thine in truth and art , kilorats , c e chaffin
