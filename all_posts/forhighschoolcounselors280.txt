in march , , i was given an excellent opportunity to begin my journey as a crete trainer crete or conflict resolution education in teacher education is a conflict resolution training funded by the jams foundation and led by one of my heroes , dr tricia jones of temple university at this moment , i have completed two crete workshops and i have one more to go before i am a certified trainer ! ! why am i so excited about crete ? one of the biggest reasons for my enthusiasm is the fact that pre service teachers and counselors have little to no exposure to conflict resolution course work in college because of their lack of training and immersion into a chaotic learning environment , these educators are likely to leave the profession within years an additional reason for becoming a crete trainer includes my desire to promote conflict resolution training among staff and students in my school teaching staff and students the art of communication , active listening , perception taking , and negotiation can create a positive learning environment ! there are many ways crete can be incorporated into a school and there are no limits to who may participate in the training to educate others about the crete training , i have added information about the training from the website creducation creducation is a wonderful site with lots of conflict resolution materials for educators created by my friend , dr bill warters of wayne state university if you have a minute , go to his website as you will not be disappointed now , more information about crete conflict resolution education in teacher education april copied from www creducation com dr bill warters why is crete important ?
