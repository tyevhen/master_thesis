i had to go to the dentist again today to get a crown and fillings it was my first time this is what i felt like this morning after three hours of drilling and twelve shots of novocain , i ca n't feel my face at all or my throat this is what i feel like right now or possibly this one i had to get the crown because my tooth had a conjoined twin that was getting cavities all up in its shit they had to get rid of the conjoined twin tooth and then file the remaining tooth down and put a temporary fake tooth over it it was pretty dramatic anyway , now i'm all pissed off , sitting at home , unable to feel my face or eyes or throat i ca n't even eat because i have no control of my swallowing muscles and i'm home alone and i 'd probably choke and the paramedics would find me and be like oh no , her face is all fucked up she must have had a stroke why was she eating raw pork ? oh wait that 's her own lip i think this is probably the saddest day ever
