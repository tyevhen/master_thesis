i have written often about acceptance and letting go it is a critical part of moving forward with your life i believe that often when we learn that we have an incurable health condition , life comes to a stop we start living in a world filled with fears of what if and what could be instead of living in the moment of what is yesterday i read an interesting article written by leo babauta in zen habits titled , the little guide to contentedness below is a portion of leo s article with the ending focused on health learning to be content if you are in a bad place in your life , and are unhappy with some things about it your health , relationship , yourself , bad habits , etc , it can be a miserable thing but here s something interesting it can also be a happy thing if you can learn to develop the right mindset , you can be happy now , without changing anything else you don t need to wait until you ve changed everything and made your life perfect before you re happy the mindset of waiting for happiness is a never ending cycle instead , learn that you can be content now , without any external changes here s how to start take a moment to be grateful for something what in your life is amazing ? even if everything seems to suck , there must be one good thing find something , and give thanks for that catch yourself thinking , this sucks it s amazing how often people think this thought it might be in different words , but if you catch yourself thinking something like that , pause reverse the thinking find a way to be thankful for the situation find the little things that can give you simple joys what do you need to be happy ? like taking a walk , spending time with a loved one , reading a book these cost very little , and require very little , and can make you very happy focus on what gives you happiness , and focus on those rather than what you don t have find the things about yourself that you re happy with we tend to criticize ourselves easily , but what if we turned it around and asked , what do i do right ? what am i good at ? what is loveable about me ? make a list start to focus on these things rather than what you re unhappy with do the same with others in your life instead of criticizing them , ask yourself , what is good about this person ? what do i love about them ? make a list , and focus on these things above all else assume that you , others , and life are perfect you are great , and don t need improvement you are already perfect other people are also just as perfect , and don t need improvement you just need to appreciate them for who they are the moment we are living in is not a stepping stone to something better it is exactly wonderful , and we have already arrived at the perfect moment the contented life it might be useful to look at what life would be like if you learned to be content look at your health , for example much of our culture s unhealthiness comes from unhappiness eating junk food to give ourselves comfort and relieve stress , not exercising because we think we can t because we have a bad self image , being glued online because we think we might miss something if we turn off the computer or iphone when you realize that you aren t missing anything , and you don t need junk food to be happy , and you are good enough to exercise , you can slowly return to health this is just one item in a contented life , but it gives you a picture of what might be and the truth is , once you learn the simple trick of contentedness , it s really a picture of what already is you just need to let go of the fears and anxieties , and see what already is be content with what you have rejoice in the way things are when you realize there is nothing lacking , the whole world belongs to you lao tzu
