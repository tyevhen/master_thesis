i would like to expand on what i said about p neiguan last month p neiguan is a complex point , rich in clinical applications descend stomach qi p is closely connected to the stomach channel and , for this reason , it is a major point to make stomach qi descend for this reason , it treats vomiting , nausea , belching and acid reflux in order to make stomach qi descend , p combines very well with ren shangwan and st liangmen notice that ren is better than ren at making stomach qi descend because it treats specifically the upper part of the stomach descend heart qi besides making stomach qi descend , p also makes heart qi descend interestingly , heart qi not descending also causes nausea and vomiting therefore , when we use p for nausea and vomiting we are acting both on the stomach and the heart channel how do we know whether nausea in a patient is due to rebellious stomach qi or rebellious heart qi ? in two ways firstly , from the pulse in case of rebellious stomach qi , we will feel that on the right guan position feeling tight or very slightly overflowing in case of rebellious heart qi , the left cun position will be slightly overflowing secondly , when nausea and vomiting are strongly associated with the emotional state i e the patient feels nausea when depressed , anxious , worried or guilty , then they are due to heart qi not descending relationship between stomach and heart there is a close relationship between the stomach and the heart that has many clinical applications and repercussions indeed , in some of the old classics , epigastric pain , i e pain below the xyphoid process was called xin tong i e aheart pain modern chinese books say that the old doctors somehow aconfused stomach with heart pain i do not agree with this view i think that the old doctors knew perfectly well the difference between a stomach and a heart pain the fact is that there is a broad overlap between the heart and stomach both from the point of view of organs and that of channels one way in which the channels of the heart and stomach overlap is through the divergent stomach channel and the great luo of the stomach in fact , the stomach divergent channel ascends in the abdomen and then enters the stomach , spleen and heart on the other hand , the great luo of the stomach starts in the chest , penetrates the diaphragm , connects with the lungs and exits below the left breast the pulsation of the left ventricle felt in the fifth intercostal space is called the pulsation of xu li and xu li is another name for the great luo of the stomach therefore , while what we feel in the fifth intercostal space is obviously the heart , from a chinese perspective , it is also the beating of the xu li and of the zong qi the qi of heart and lungs in the chest what this means in clinical practice , is that treatment of the stomach channel is important to regulate the heart both on a physical and a mental emotional level on a physical level , treatment of st and st is important to regulate the rhythm of the heart when it is irregular or fast and to make heart qi descend when there is nausea on an emotional level , treatment of st calms the mind and makes heart qi descend , allaying anxiety and worry not by chance , some of the symptoms of myocardial infarction are often digestive such as belching , acid reflux , nausea and vomiting happy new year of the rabbit !
