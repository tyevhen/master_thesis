years ago , i had a student who repeatedly asked me how psychotherapy works how is it different than a conversation ? when i think of psychotherapy , i think in terms of the talking itself as being the aspect that helps and yes , of course it can be used in conjunction with medications i think of it as being structured in terms of time and place and frequency and being all about the patient and whether or not it 's actually discussed , some of what works is about the relationship most people do n't get better talking to someone they despise , and the warmth , empathy , feeling listened to and cared for , well , they 're all important and i also think of it as being a process over time these are all parts of my definition , however , and they may not be parts of yours so what about about a one time event ? if someone meets with a therapist once , has wonderful insights and feels better , is that psychotherapy ? clink , this is your cue to put up a post about the taxi driver in new orleans if someone meets with their priest hairdresser auto mechanic once or twice or times and feels better , is that psychotherapy ? if someone talks to a friend over coffee every morning while the dogs play , is that psychotherapy clearly , it is therapy because most things involving either chocolate or coffee have some therapeutic value ? if a patient meets with a therapist every week for an hour long session for years on end , but never utters a single word , is that psychotherapy ? some psychiatrists include education about illness and medication as part of their definition of psychotherapy others measure it by time if it 's minutes it 's a med check , if it 's minutes , it 's psychotherapy okay , so what makes it 'psychotherapy ? ' fyi there 's no right answer
