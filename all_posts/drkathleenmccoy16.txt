in the past few weeks , i 've received a number of emails from readers who have been trying to buy a copy of the teenage body book edition and are having trouble finding it on amazon i'm so sorry for the difficulty ! for reasons neither i nor the publisher can understand , an amazon search for the teenage body book brings up only the old edition in an effort to solve the problem , the publisher is planning to take the old edition out of print , but in the meantime , you can find the edition either by typing my name kathy mccoy , ph d into the amazon search the book will come up third on the list even better , you can click on the following link to access the amazon page for the new teenage body book https www amazon com exec obidos asin if you missed my previous blog post introducing this new edition , here 's the link to that dr kathy mccoy living fully in midlife and beyond the project of a lifetime and here is a new short trailer for the book again , my apologies for the ordering difficulty the publisher is working very hard with amazon to correct this as soon as possible in the meantime , i really appreciate those of you who have not only wanted to buy a copy of the teenage body book but who also have made me and my publisher aware of the amazon glitch ! thank you so much !
