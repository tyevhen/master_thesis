it 's taken me awhile to get to this post today because it 's been a bit of a rough one i mentioned in my last post that i had a dip in my mood over the weekend the dip became a gully by tuesday evening by wednesday it was a gigantic , suffocating pit i could barely move i managed better today , but things have been tough one of the symptoms i struggle with when i'm not doing so hot is screwed up thinking i get negative thoughts , slightly paranoid thoughts , and or intrusive scary thoughts about bad things happening to people i love i hate to even admit i have these thoughts i guess i'm ashamed it 's hard for me to feel out of control of my own thinking i know the thoughts are a symptom of my depression , but i still find them distressing and difficult i 've been working diligently to let the thoughts just pass through my brain , to not put a lot of stock into them or worry too much about them thoughts are just thoughts they only have power if i give them power but not worrying about them is easier said than done like a dip in my mood , screwed up thinking scares me it 's so hard not to wonder if this is the start of something bigger and darker i'm doing my best not to worry , to let the thoughts be just annoying thoughts , but like i said , sometimes it 's easier said than done so it 's one day , sometimes one moment , at a time right now i'm working again tomorrow and hoping the distraction gives me a bit of respite ironically , it is highly likely this mood disruption is due to the stress of returning to work nevertheless , i actually think working tomorrow , focusing on others for awhile , will be helpful in the meantime , i 'll take any extra prayers available
