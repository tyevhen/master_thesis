painting with my cat sasha the world breaks everyone and afterwards some are strong at the broken places ernest hemingway nine days ago i broke my foot six days ago i put my hand through a glass window , badly cutting it in the process granted the glass in the window was old and my hand slipped off of the wood frame , but this injury and my foot in an aircast after fracturing my fifth metatarsal have caused me to wonder about what the universe is trying to say here there is a message and meaning to everything that happens to us in life the answers i know will be revealed in good time patience , ever the virtue and something i struggle with , will win in the end the irony is that for weeks this summer i trekked through some of the burliest country in north america in the alaskan interior , slashing and hacking , climbing and slipping yet , here not ten minutes from my homes , the simplest of twists when i was not looking where i was going changes your life in a large way however , instead of wallowing in the situation i am trying to use the time to accomplish some solid work and continue to prepare for the newfoundland portraits exhibition which is now less than three months away i am also continuing work on paintings based on christopher mccandless' photographs of his odyssey around north america which will eventually form an exhibition as well , happening in either or my physician advised me to keep my cast on as often as possible and to elevate my foot frequently i have had to devise a way to paint with my foot raised up , which is no feat pun intended however i think the greatest lesson that i can discern from this break , at least for now , is how much we take mobility in life for granted i realize now that running is out of the question , that moving quickly is not in my vocabulary for the next while , how fortunate we are when we can move as swiftly as our feet can carry us it makes me appreciate each day and each task that we can do ourselves with even more humility and gratitude plus , it is an opportunity to focus energy that might have been spent on other things , towards my painting i have included a photo of the cast on the edge of my easel while i paint below not terribly exciting but fortunately i have a job where i can work in this condition i have about five weeks left with the cast and other than learning to hobble as well as possible with this aircast my work is coalescing and paintings are being completed , new ones begun and i am thankful for the support of friends and family too my friend gayle brought some fresh vegetables from her garden and some homemade vegan ! chickpea salad for me thank you almost does n't do justice to these beautiful acts of kindness in terms of what is happening in the studio i will include two pictures of paintings in progress for you to see what i have been up to this is not a great photo but you get the idea here this gentleman is a great character and kind soul who i met while in wesleyville , newfoundland last september i loved his small shed with the low door frame and asked him to stand in that space i enjoyed the darkness behind him and love to do paintings with doors and frames that are echoed in the shape of the canvas itself thus george posed for me for a few minutes and i am working hard to have this painting completed by month 's end this painting is one that is very near and dear to my heart i expect to have it finished in one more solid day 's work it is a painting based on chris mccandless' photo of his backpack on the stampede trail in the alaskan interior on or around april th , he had just been dropped off by jim gallien , an electrician who gave him a lift as far as he could down the uneven stampede road that becomes stampede trail eventually chris would have been alone on the trail for the first time and probably his pack was the first and logical thing to take a picture of as a symbol of himself , his journey , his philosophy there is almost an ansel adamsesque quality to his shot , a quality that i wanted to capture in my painting as faithfully as possible i will post the completed painting on my other blog , heather horton artwork as soon as it is finished and chris' parents have seen it on a side note , i am trying to start thinking about a way to make the exhibition of paintings related to chris' life and photographs a traveling exhibit christopher was a traveler , and i thought how appropriate a traveling exhibit would be for such a peripatetic man , a beautiful soul who turned thought into action and his incredible odyssey is a testament to that philosophy i am sure chris would agree with henry david thoreau , a hero of his , to not lose hold of your dreams or aspirations for if you do , you may still exist but you have ceased to live therefore if anyone reading this blog entry has any ideas about publicly or government funded galleries looking to exhibit these paintings about chris' life and journey , please send me a message i would like to start planning this exhibit now , because the time to show them will arrive soon !
