my new invented term for ajax using ex quick , somebody trademark it ! not javascript , xml , and element names so as ex finds increasing use in the ajax world , a potential stumbling block comesinto focus around hyphens and other non word characters in element names the issue is this ex has a dot syntax for xml objects that allows expressions like root x y to obtain the y element under an x element under the root but when an element name contains a hyphen , this syntax breaks consider var fragment content field display label please approve display label field content now try to access the display label value var value fragment field display label referenceerror ! the interpreter treats a hyphen as a minus sign , of course , and since label has n't been declared , it 's undefined and unusable if a variable named label does happen to exist in the current scope e g you used var label in place of var value above , you wo n't get any error at all , since subtraction on two defined entities is always a legal production in javascript the workaround fortunately , ex supplies an alternative syntax we can use instead of this var value fragment field display label referenceerror ! do this var value fragment field display label please approve there 's one more syntax breakage to deal with , and that involves the descendant retrieval syntax e g , root y returns a list of all y descendants under root , regardless of what level in the tree each one is at this syntax obviously breaks down if y is something like data item the workaround is to use the ex descendants method instead of this var alllabels fragment display label error ! do this var alllabels fragment descendants display label list of nodes similar breakages and workarounds exist for ex attribute syntax , the details of which are left as an exercise for the reader
