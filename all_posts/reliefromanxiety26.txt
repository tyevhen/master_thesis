after finding out a few weeks ago that i would be graduating with first class honours in law , i knew that it would n't be long until graduation weekend came around the strange thing is that it has all happened in a blink of an eye literally , blink and you 'll miss it i remember my first day of university and feeling like a small fish in a big pond and that the thought of graduation was so long away right now though , it almost feels as if my university experience has been blurred into one big momentous memory it was the time of my life and i do n't regret it all , i'm just sad that it 's over and that it seemed to last merely seconds when graduation came around , i could n't quite believe that the day was finally here i registered and ran into all of my course mates , friends and lecturers that i had spent time with one way or another over the years i proceeded to collect my robes and had endless photos in those moments though , it all felt surreal it was the weirdest feeling because i was feeling a mix of emotions both happy and sad , excited and nervous but what scared me the most was the fact that i knew this day would never come again and i was finally living the dream that i had always wanted to achieve i attended the ceremony which was very formal and full of university tradition we had the head of our law school , a high court judge read out our names with all of our family , friends and fellow graduates onlooking and to whom we gave huge applause for the support they had given us over the years as quickly as the lecturers , sheriffs , chancellors and students went up on the stage , it was the end of the ceremony i even combatted one of my biggest fears of being on stage which soon became a moment of happiness it 's definitely a day i wo n't be forgetting i am no longer a student but an alumni of the university , which is weird to say because i still feel years old i ca n't really put into words how it felt , but for all of you who have graduated , you will know what i mean ! an amazing three years , with amazing people it has changed me as a person and i will miss it dearly i am extremely proud of what i have achieved and i will hold on to the bundle of emotions of graduation day for the rest of my days i will always be fond of those and hold it close to my heart you are stronger than you think and can achieve anything you put your mind to
