can something as simple as height explain women 's lower earning power ? it 's funny how , in the space of years or so , height research has gone from an oddball , poorly respected area of research to a fully legitimate , active branch of the larger field of anthropometry people who work in this area study things like how population height varies over time , how body height varies with respect to things like income or mortality , etc some pretty interesting facts have come to light for example , there is absolutely no doubt any more that height predicts your lifetime earning potential dozens of studies and meta analyses studies of studies show that tall people earn more , your height at age predicts future earnings , every extra inch of height means yr more salary u s , of ceos are above average height , etc , and also the income of a nation predicts the height of its people log income per capita versus median body height baten blum it 's also well established that europeans are now taller than americans , and that in fact americans not only stopped growing taller years ago , they 've actually been shrinking , and u s women are shrinking faster than men european men have been getting taller , but american men have been shrinking since the median dutch woman of today is taller than the median dutch man of years ago but the median u s woman is only a couple millimeters taller today than the u s woman of years ago women in the u s have come full circle note a quick back of the envelope calculation shows that about of the gender pay differential in the u s can be explained by height alone women in the u s are now about inches shorter than men the height advantage in pay is per year per inch that 's almost less , per year , for women the median per capita income difference between u s men and women is about k per year qed a huge amount of research has been done correlating height with income i wo n't repeat it here and lately it 's become fashionable to do all kinds of research on income inequality i'm reading piketty 's capital now an essential book for understanding inequality , so i naturally assumed that someone , by now , has surely looked at height versus income inequality but surprisingly , i could find nothing in the recent literature however , i did stumble onto a fantastic bit of citizen science on this subject a blogger at bbninja com has obtained height data for about countries , and income inequality data for those same countries , and plotted the data the graph for men looks like this male height y axis versus gini coefficient x axis for various countries a high gini value means high income inequality what we see is just what i would have predicted , which is that there is a definite inverse correlation r between body height and income inequality wherever income inequality is greater , men tend to be shorter the graph for females is virtually identical this is somewhat counterintuitive inasmuch as high gini countries tend , also , to be rich countries we know that rich countries have taller people but that only makes the above graph more believable , in my opinion inequality is not simply a proxy for income the correlation is not super strong , because so many factors go into determining how tall you become we would n't expect gini coefficient to explain very much of a person 's height , and indeed it does n't the r squared value above means it explains , at most , about of height differences still , it 's a superb result and deserves to be published or made into a dissertation some enterprising grad student should seize on these results and pursue the matter further , perhaps for example determining , numerically , the degree to which income inequality or other factors account for the height difference between men and women it 's likely to be a small degree , obviously , because we know the gender height differential is biological but do we know that ? no specific biochemical or molecular genetic mechanism has ever been offered for the height difference between males and females we know of one gene on the x chromosome that when overexpressed , in females accounts for of the height difference between the sexes , in humans aside from that , it 's not known how women end up shorter since they have essentially the same genes as men , differing only in having two copies of the x chromosome tip it 's not a simple matter of hormones women actually make several times more pituitary growth hormone than men so if you 're a grad student in biology , please work on explaining in detailed molecular terms how women end up shorter this is still very much an open question and if you 're a grad student in sociology , please work on explaining the degree to which sociological factors access to health care , access to nutrition , access to wealth , exposure to poverty , etc make women end up shorter let me know when you 're done , so i can blog the results here tired of lies and half truths about mental illness ? arm yourself with some facts check out my free book mental health myths debunked tons of info , tons of live links , lots of straight talk about depression , suicide , meds , therapy , psychiatry , mental health trends , statistics , and more and you know me , i call bullshit on bogus ideas then give urls to the actual data , so you can weigh the evidence for yourself the idea that antidepressants take weeks to do anything ? myth most people benefit from antidepressants ? myth antidepressants separate from placebo in clinical trials ? largely myth half the trials show separation half do n't electroshock therapy is safe and effective ? bigtime myth ect is dangerous and consent forms are based on obsolete data but do n't take my word for it read the science for yourself it 's all laid out with references in the book download epub or pdf now at noisetrade tell a friend i want to thank the following great folks who retweeted me yesterday on twitter my advice ?
