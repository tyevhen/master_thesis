last thursday i attended a legal afternoon tea in canary wharf , london a few months back , i attended a legal networking dinner as part of my university one of the attendees was from aspiring solicitors , whom ultimately provided this opportunity to go to canary wharf and i luckily got chosen ! one of my goals to rid myself of my anxiety is to keep pushing myself outside of comfort zone , and as a result i went to barclays in canary wharf as many of you know , i love london it 's my favourite place , and so to get a chance to go and take part in something to do with hopefully my future law career , was amazing i really enjoyed the experience and ca n't quite believe that i was there , when i think about the mental health journey i have been on we were all treated with such respect , everyone was so professional , the buildings were massive and the view from the th floor was amazing i had never been to a building like that before , with scanners , huge lifts , and so much glass it 's a world away from anything i have experienced before i am so glad i went , as it 's one more step in my recovery journey overall my anxiety was n't too bad i was more excited than nervous i have included some pictures below amy xx
