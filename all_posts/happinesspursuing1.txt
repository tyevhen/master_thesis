this is n't a real post , just a follow up on the last one that post was incredibly cathartic for me writing it was the last time i wept uncontrollably over the situation i 've squished out a few tears since but nothing like before clearly , i was angry at my wife over the situation and i still think that we had other options but , that 's in the past and i have to balance that against everything else dan savage , who i think is incredibly wise in these things , talks about the price of admission that is those things about your mate that you overlook or just get past in order to maintain the relationship this has to be one of those for me i'm not an easy person but , i 've found a person who is easy with me i need to accept this price of admission actually , things have improved for me since i posted that last entry like i said , it was cathartic for me my relationship with my wife has improved and i feel our bond is strengthening death happens life sucks
