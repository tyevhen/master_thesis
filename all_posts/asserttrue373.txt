it 's a mystery why should the geography of cancer be different for men than for women ? maybe you can think of an answer if so , be sure to leave a comment here 's the graph for cancer mortality rates among all u s women , by county , courtesy of http ratecalc cancer gov ratecalc notably , cancer in women seems to be higher along the mississippi and ohio rivers as well as the hudson river there is also a lot of red in coastal new england , the gulf states except southern texas and southern florida , and northern california compare the above graph to the graph for u s men the map for men shows an extraordinary concentration of cancer mortality in the south note the huge difference between southern florida and northern florida , and also between west texas and east texas a thin strip of reduced cancer geography follows the appalachian trail it should be noted that the numbers for men are much higher than for women in the graph for women , the darkest reds start at , which is only light pink on the men 's graph nevertheless , the key point is that the geographical distribution of mortality is qualitatively much different for men the highest death rates for men are clearly in the southern states it was n't always this way the two graphs above are for the years to the graph below shows what cancer mortality for u s men looked like using statistics from to this graph shows a pattern much more similar to the women 's graph somehow , between the s and the s , cancer in men migrated to the southern states but why ? one clue might be found in the country 's changing demographics the u s had a much younger population in than in in , barely of the country was age or over today about of u s citizens are or over the cancers of old age , in men , are lung no and prostate no and it does appear that cancer mortalities from those two categories map disproportionately to the southern states i 'll show the prostate map in my next post but still , cancer knows nothing about geography why should it be more pronounced in the south ? especially since a map of u s population by age shows no accumulation of older americans in the south ? this is , in my opinion , a rather large open question in epidemiology it would be nice if someone could provide an answer
