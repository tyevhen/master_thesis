are the telltale signs of burnout ? many people come to therapy when they get to the point where they feel they just ca n't cope any more the following fictional vignette illustrates how a lack of self care can lead to bigger problems , and how therapy can help nina nina came to therapy after she developed stress related health problems , including debilitating headaches , chest pains related to anxiety as well as insomnia self care taking time out to take care of yourself at her doctor 's recommendation , she took off a month from work , which she had resisted doing for a long time but when her doctor warned her that her symptoms would get worse unless she took time off to relax and regroup , she knew she had to do it during that time , she stopped having headaches and panic attacks , but she began to feel depressed at home without her usual demanding work schedule when she consulted with her doctor again , she told her to get help in therapy , so she started therapy a week after she began her break from work nina was a perfectionist since she was a child if she did n't do things perfectly at school and at home , she felt she was a failure there was no in between she was a straight a student , but she derived no joy or satisfaction from her accomplishments because she felt this was what was expected of her she had to be perfect both of her parents were perfectionists as well before they retired , both of them were rewarded in their fields for their perfectionism her mother was a well respected lawyer and her father was a top surgeon in his field so , nina grew up in a household where there was a lot of pressure to be the best nina did very well in college and in graduate school she found it relatively easy to be at the top of her class then , she came to nyc and

competition she felt like she had to always be on her toes to stay on top she was rewarded with the respect of her superiors as well as monetarily for her long hours at work but , as previously mentioned , the pace was taking its toll on her health self care taking time out to take care of yourself when her therapist mentioned self care , nina was n't even sure what her therapist meant she was n't even sure where to begin her therapist taught nina breathing exercises and how to meditate , and she recommended that nina practice for a short time everyday to get into the habit of taking care of herself initially , this felt so unfamiliar to nina that she felt guilty taking the time to de stress instead of working or doing something productive when she felt her mind wandering , her sense of perfectionism got in her way because she was sure that she was n't doing it right , which almost felt unbearable to her it took a lot of practice and a lot of encouragement from her therapist for her to stay on track with her self care practices once she was able to practice meditation and breathing with less difficulty , her therapist helped nina to work on her perfectionism nina learned that underneath the perfectionism there was core shame working on her shame was more challenging because it was uncomfortable for her but her therapist helped nina to see that this is a common problem and shame is often at the core of emotional problems for many people self care taking time out to take care of yourself when nina went back to work , she got into the habit of taking time each morning to do her breathing exercises and meditation , even if she only did it for minutes nina also made a conscious decision that her health was more important to her than her next promotion and that if getting that promotion meant compromising her health , it was n't worth it so , she reduced the hours that she put in at work nina and her therapist continued to work on nina 's longstanding sense of shame that fueled her perfectionism her therapist used a combination of emdr eye movement desensitization and reprocessing and somatic experiencing over time , nina was able to work through her feelings of shame eventually , she decided that her current profession no longer suited her and she began to train for a less stressful profession she continued to engage in the self care techniques
