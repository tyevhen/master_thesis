have you forgotten , the deep , timbre voice gets my attention i ca n't help the grin that twists my lips is that even possible i mused , having to pretend i was n't surprised to see him i did n't want to risk scaring him off his eyes flick to the screen of my laptop , i would assume so i'm not replacing you if that is what your worried about i said giving him a smug smile he gives me a sideways glance , really i roll my eyes , it 's not what you think it 's been six months , how much more time has to pass before you will admit it he sneered down at me i sucked in a breath , had it really been that long i have n't forgotten you william , okay your story has just been postponed i did n't look him in the eye when i said it , i had never been able to lie to him you what 's been postponed a haughty voice asked from the door rachel , you ca n't just interrupt it 's rude a young , but deep voice chided the couple stepped in the room , the girl 's chin held high , and proud the poor light turned the boy 's naturally green skin , a pukish yellow they eyed william 's lithe form , with a mixture of caution and curiosity william crossed his arms , are these the children who took my place children rachel echoed with unchecked disgust william please , it 's not like that he fix his sharp gaze on me , his eyes accusing a small hand tugged my arm , i stared with sympathy and surprise , at the dirty tutu clad girl a gas mask covered her face what the hell is that ! william exclaimed stepping back from her she is a little girl , a pale , corpse like sixteen year old admonished , pointing the barrel of his shot gun at williams chest walter ! i yelled , shaking my head at the gun he lowered it slowly , and pulled the girl to his side i blew out an exasperated breath , honestly ! is this a party ? a accented voice cut in , the owner stepped in wearing an outrageous hat and suit the colors clashed immensely with his streaked hair his black lined eyes took in the ragtag group before him with a cheeky grin anyone can see this is n't a party charlie , there is n't even a cake the snippy tone seemed to match the overbearing shade of red that was her hair she pulled at her patchwork dress , and took hold of charlie 's right arm he did n't seemed to mind william gave them a sickened glance they all looked each other over with confusion you missed the costume party , johnny depp walter said , with a bark of laughter say 's the dirt coated urchin , isabella spat , pulling charlie behind her she stomped up to walter is that blood ? charlie whispered once they were face to face walter smiled , his teeth bone white against his dirty skin his pupils dilated , would you like to find out william smirked , and aden and rachel exchanged concerned glances charlie held isabella back from physically attacking the teen aged zombie stop it ! i shouted uselessly , my laptop almost slipped from my lap , as i straightened to admonish them all this is n't right , your not supposed to be here all at once i got blank stares in return there is something odd here charlie observed , easing his grip on isabella mummers of agreement , followed , as they all looked around the white , mostly empty room we 've moved william observed again walter offered that 's it ! isabella said , her anger forgotten , why , we 're are where it all began charlie finished it 's rather small rachel scoffed homey , aden said i thought we had moved walter said , looking unimpressed with the familiar surroundings we had i stuttered out , my face flushed with heat yet here we are william said , with his typical mocking tone so i changed my mind , i growled , i do n't have to explain myself lest of all to you lot touchy , walter mumbled they all agreed , making more rude remarks as a group all of their voices blended together , like an un tuned violin she has seem rather out of sorts stressed i would say straight up bad tempered moody they all said this in half whispers , as if i was n't sitting two feet from them i'm right here ! i shouted , the crowd of them together , was trying my patience they all looked at me , some with fake pity and smiles william and walter looked unapologetic oi , your a loud one , a heavily accented voice spoke coming out of the shadows by the door a bottle was clenched in his pale fingers he sported an un zipped leather jacket , that revealed his pale skin beneath loud enough to wake the dead walter had the audacity to smirk he choked down another drink , bloody humans charlie and isabella crept over to him , where have you been peter ? apparently uninvited , along with this dodgy guy in the hall he brushed a piece of hair out of his face , he has some messed up eyes petty words from a simpleton , came the disgusted response , from a tall , white haired being see , he ai n't very friendly peter said with hasty look behind him , no , offense mate how would you like to see your death his voice was velvety yet threatening his violet eyes fixed on the peter peter shrugged , already have , thank you the goblin king looked perturbed who 's this now isabella looked up at a tall , treeish man who had appeared on the bed he had a hat , that seemed to have a point but was bent and flattened he tugged at his long beard , as he regarding the room with a look of bewilderment twigdorwth , you nosy girl he scolded , holding out a long bony finger , i told you saber , the young have no respect for there elders she is proof see here , isabella exclaimed where are we , twig ? questioned a young man , with rather shaggy black hair and pointed ears his unearthly blue eyes scanned each of the strangers in turn i seem to have made an error , twigdorwth said , pulling at his leaf filled robes , shaking loads of dirt and leaves onto the clean bed i have no idea who these ruffians are , nor where this insipid place is just who exactly do you think you are talking to , grandpa someone yelled out other insults followed the chorus of angry voices rising i am nobody 's grandfather , twigdorwth bellowed , pushing saber behind him , as he brandished his staff that 's when someone took advantage of the angry throng , and decided to hit someone , what had been a rather verbal group of confused people , became a riot madness ensued curses , and punches were exchanged , peter rolled his head and bared his fangs before joining the melee screams , hair pulling , magic sparked some left , fleeing the fight i caught william 's smiling face , as he went in swinging i do n't like this party charlie called out from somewhere in the thick of it it 's not a party ! was the breathless answer walter fired a warning shot , taking the last of my patience go away all of you ! i screamed , throwing my hands over my ears , and flinging myself onto my computer i lied there , willing the noise to stop it did i raised my head looking around my room in relief to find it empty once more i let out a small cry of relief collapsing back onto my pillow that 's when i saw him , my dad , standing in the doorway his mouth quirked in a half smile and his face somewhere between humored and concerned he strode in , coming to a stop behind my bed it 's not i can i stumbled on my words , how does one even begin to explain he smiles at me , it 's full of pity he places his warm , giant hand on my forehead your definitely not okay he says with a laugh then he leaves if you made it through this you are an amazing person , and i salute you based on a true story mostly
