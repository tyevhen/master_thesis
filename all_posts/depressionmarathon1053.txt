it was a cold , sunny day today i got up early but could n't get out the door for over hours after watching sportscenter times in a row , i finally had the moment i was waiting for that magical window of energetic readiness i ran to the bedroom and donned the requisite gear again , it was the tights that brought puck to his feet we slogged through the first mile of a loosely planned miler in the colder than anticipated air it felt like a long day was in store actually , the mileage lengthened , while the run shortened the magical energy must have returned , for i realized i was running comfortably at a quicker than normal pace eight miles later , puck was lagging behind while i was finishing up with my fastest mile of the day it was one of those runs it must have been the beautiful steak i was served last night it could have resulted from the speedwork i 've done the past three weeks whatever the reason , it was one of those easy days when everything clicked it was one of those runs nice now , if only my mood would get easy , too oh well , we ca n't have everything can we ?
