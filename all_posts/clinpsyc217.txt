wyeth 's attempt at an antipsychotic bifeprunox was rejected by the fda today liz spikol has a post on the topic that i found immensely entertaining daniel carlat points out why the drug was rejected because it does not work very well yes , some doses showed a bit of improvement over placebo , yet bifeprunox did not impress when tried head to head against risperidone or olanzapine adding this drug to an already crowded antipsychotic market would seemingly do little for people with schizophrenia but would help wyeth , which is looking a little desperate these days considering it has little to replace its flagship antidepressant effexor what about pristiq , the son of effexor , well , that ai n't looking so promising , , good luck , wyeth it appears you 're going to need it !
