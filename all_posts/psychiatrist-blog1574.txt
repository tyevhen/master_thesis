written by clinkshrink she 's having computer issues and asked me to post this for her periodically i like to check the search terms that people use to find shrink rap today i found one that just had to be blogged about what medication will make me a nice person ? my first thought was , how do you know you 're not a nice person ? are you embezzling funds from the company expense account ? do you kick puppies and kittens ? do you park in handicapped parking spaces ? are there bodies hidden under your floorboards if so , please let roy out we miss him there are a lot of ways that someone could be not nice , but i have to say that the majority of seriously un nice people i 've met either do n't care that they 're not nice or do n't have enough insight to even ask the question if you 're willing to recognize you might be having interpersonal problems you ca n't be all bad that being said , the next question is to figure out why someone might think this is an issue that is medication responsive there certainly are psychiatric illnesses that could make someone episodically irritable recurrent clinical depression , premenstrual syndrome late luteal phase disorder in modern parlance , hypomania or mania , the list goes on medication can be helpful for these conditions other conditions would n't necessarily require medication but could be responsive to lifestyle or environmental changes caffeinism how much coffee am i drinking every day nowadays ? do n't ask ! , sleep deprivation , alcohol abuse or other substance issues finally , there are issues that are n't really your issues at all i immigrated to maryland from the land of terminally nice people it took me a little while to realize that people who change lanes without signalling , who honk for no apparent reason , are n't necessarily being rude they 're just being baltimoreans it 's how people live out here there are people who constantly accept and make allowances for impositions that most people would never tolerate you know the type they say yes to everything that anybody ever asks them to do , they stay late at work because no one else volunteers to help out , they 're usually the ones who finally end up cleaning out the office refrigerator because they just ca n't take it anymore they work in prison because no one else will when someone like that grows a backbone and starts saying 'no' and setting limits , they might get accused of being 'not nice' anymore good for them i have no idea if the googling not nice searcher found what they were looking for on our blog , but i wanted to leave something behind that might be useful in case they come back good luck
