for those who follow my blog , you know that the above comment is a favorite of mine the meaning behind it is twofold whatever is happening will disappear go away whether it is good or bad or , my negative feelings or perceptions will pass and life will go on this last sunday i woke up with severe weakness and discomfort in my neck i found it difficult to hold my head up while doing most anything for example , eating , brushing my teeth and drinking we went out to lunch with friends on monday and it was difficult and uncomfortable the weakness was difficult to handle , but the pain exacerbated the issue it was then i decided to do something about it the first thing i did was evaluate my routines was i doing anything that was different or possibly contributing to the weakness and pain ? i realized i have been spending a lot more time writing this last couple of weeks in the process , i was leaning down and more to my left to work the mouse okay , i corrected the posture i also applied heat to the neck muscles twice a day for the next two days that helped with the stiffness and pain and , i began performing several neck exercises every hours throughout the day i normally do them only in the morning and evenings finally , every time i wanted to complain , i told myself , this too shall pass for some reason the statement seems to ease the attitude portion of the problem so i can focus on the physical aspects of it the results tuesday , the neck wasn t any better , but it also wasn t worse wednesday , i had less pain and the neck was not quite as weak today , the pain is almost gone and the weakness is even less pronounced having a problem ? give this too shall pass a try and see if it helps picture pinterest and astrid terese
