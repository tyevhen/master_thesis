after the frippery of the last two posts , here is a hefty new year analysis of community treatment orders , complete with references and tasty statistics don t forget to put me in your references , amhp trainees ! the mental health act introduced a new role for amhp s functions relating to the new powers of community treatment orders these functions were to agree or not to the making of a community treatment order cto s a the extension of a cto sa conditions to be included in a cto sb and revocation of a ctosf mental health act new roles , nimhe , october previously , the nearest equivalent had been sec a , relating to aftercare under supervision sec a , inserted into the mha in , had been intended to provide a legal framework to ensure that patients who had been detained under sec could be treated in the community however , sec a never really had any legal teeth to enforce this essentially , the patient had to agree to the imposition of aftercare under supervision if they disagreed , then no order could be made , and they would just have to be discharged anyway when they were well enough even if they did agree , they could change their mind at any time , and not much could practically be done about it i was only ever involved in one discharge under sec a the patient , who had been in hospital under sec for several years , willingly agreed to a comprehensive plan for aftercare in the predischarge meetings however , the instant he had been formally discharged from sec , he changed his mind about it all within a fortnight , he had stopped his medication and began to hide from his care coordinator , and two weeks later he turned up at his parents house in the middle of the night , beside himself with fear because everyone in charwood was listening to his thoughts on their tv s and the cia had tracker drones scanning his every move within a month of being on sec a he was back in hospital under sec sec a never really caught on community treatment orders , however , are something different they were also quite controversial , since various human rights organisations had concerns about the proposed powers , which could compel patients to have treatment in the community on pain of being recalled to hospital if they refused there are certainly ethical issues with cto s can it ever be right to force people who are not detained in hospital to take medication against their will ? but then what is the alternative ? the stated purpose of cto s is to allow suitable patients to be safely treated in the community rather than under detention in hospital , and to provide a way to help prevent relapse and any harm to the patient or to others that this might cause it is intended to help patients to maintain stable mental health outside hospital and to promote recovery mha code of practice that sounds pretty good , doesn t it ? in addition , the power is designed only to be used with severely mentally disordered people who are at high risk of relapse , often referred to as revolving door patients people like jenny , about whom i wrote in july god told me not to answer the door ! , who are having to be repeatedly admitted to hospital , often under the mha those frequent relapses and admissions , when the person may take many months in hospital to recover , are likely to be far more harmful to their quality of life than the imposition of controls that may actually allow them to function normally and live a fulfilled life in their own homes there is an odd thing , though , about cto s this is the role of the amhp in the whole process asw s , amhp s predecessors , had specific and extensive powers in relation to the detention of patients under the mha as i have often described on this blog , the asw amhp has the power , and the responsibility , to arrange for the detention and admission of a mentally disordered patient doctors can recommend , but it is the asw amhp who makes the final decision and who takes the consequences for that decision the asw amhp is acting independently of the local authority that approves them despite the opinions of some patients that amhp s enjoy exerting their power , the reality is that it is an onerous and stressful task that is never taken lightly but cto s put the amhp in the position of merely recommending and endorsing the decision of the responsible clinician rc , the psychiatrist in charge of the patient their role , although essential to the legal process , is comparatively minor in practice , it consists of little more than signing a brief , preprinted statement on a piece of paper the amhp becomes involved in the cto process in three ways in the case of the making of the cto in the first place , the amhp is presented with a form cto already largely filled out by the rc the amhp then has to sign that he or she agrees that the patient meets the legal criteria , that the cto is appropriate , and that any conditions that the rc has made are necessary or appropriate in the case of the extension of a cto beyond the initial months cto the amhp again has to agree that the patient meets the criteria and that extension is appropriate when a patient has been recalled to hospital by the rc under the powers of the cto and it appears they will need to remain in hospital for more than hours , the rc will then reinvoke the original sec by revoking the cto then the amhp simply has to agree on form cto that the patient meets the criteria for detention in hospital , and that it is appropriate to revoke the cto however , a funny thing about cto s is the remarkable lack of rules or guidance relating to the discharge of the amhp s role amhp s are subject to all sorts of requirements relating to the detention of patients , laid down either in the act itself , or in guidance in the form of the reference guide and the code of practice these include having to interview the patient in a suitable manner before making a decision , the correct identification of the nearest relative , notifying the patient and their nearest relative of their rights under the act , having to write a detailed report explaining and justifying their decisions , and ensuring that all other the legal requirements have been met failure to do any of these things may lead to accusations that the amhp has acted in bad faith or even illegally but when it comes to cto s , there is no requirement to write a report unless you disagree with the psychiatrist department of health guidance published in states only in making these judgements , the amhp is expected to bring knowledge of the patient s social situation into the discussion this may require discussion with the patient s care co ordinator or key worker so that information about the patient s home , family , informal support networks , cultural background , and so on can all form part of the decisions which are taken about sct supervised community treatment a guide for practitioners , dh , sep there is no actual requirement even to interview the patient or consult with the nearest relative there also seems to be no guidance as to what would constitute grounds to disagree with the consultant s view somehow , that doesn t feel right although cto s have been in force since the end of , it wasn t until a few months ago that i was actually called upon to discharge my amhp functions i have now signed a cto making a cto and a cto revoking a cto so that now makes me an expert , of course although i am sure that many amhp s , after two years of the new powers , will have been involved in plenty of cto s , especially if they are hospital based , and can therefore easily pop down the corridor to fill in a form , it came as something of a surprise to me to suddenly be exercising a new function so i consulted with other colleagues as to how to go about making the assessment and the decision that was when i fully realised the lack of guidance and procedural protocols the other amhp s , even those who had been involved in many cto s , all seemed somehow uncomfortable with the whole process , all approaching the task in their own ways , and as much in the dark about it all as i was the first request i received was for a cto on a year old girl who had been in hospital for over a year under sec that in itself put me outside my comfort zone in my day to day work i only work with adults she had a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder this made me even more uncomfortable it had always been my belief that the usual age of onset for bipolar affective disorder was somewhere in the mid s to mid s could a child therefore even receive this diagnosis ? child and adolescent psychiatry was even more mysterious than i had thought however , it was not my role as amhp to question a diagnosis i simply had to decide whether to agree with the patient s responsible clinician that the patient meets the criteria for sct , and if so whether sct is appropriate , mha code of practice i also had to consider the wider social context for the patient relevant factors may include any support networks the patient may have , the potential impact on the rest of the patient s family , and employment issues the amhp should consider how the patient s social and cultural background may influence the family environment in which they will be living and the support structures potentially available , code of practice so i consulted with the hospital rc who was actually making the cto , as well as the community rc who would be managing the cto i spoke to the care coordinator i interviewed the patient , who was on s home leave in charwood , and her mother i read the girl s psychiatric notes then i wrote a report , simply using as headings the factors to be taken into account then the hospital rc posted the cto to me i wasn t going to drive miles to fill in a form when i received it , i filled in my part , then posted it back and when he received it a couple of days later , it was completed and she became subject to supervised community treatment and that was the end of my involvement , although i suppose i may be called on to be involved in any renewal process after the first months the other piece of work i have so far done was a revocation of a cto following a recall to hospital this related to leroy , who i wrote about in this blog in may leroy had been on a cto for over a year , but on christmas day he was found naked by police in charwood town centre , stopping cars and kissing the windows ill advised use of amphetamine was believed to be implicated he had been informally admitted to bluebell ward , but it was clear , despite the amphetamine wearing off , that he was unwell and would need to remain in hospital for more than hours i felt more comfortable with this i knew leroy well , i knew his relapse signature , and it seemed likely that it would be appropriate for him to remain in hospital for treatment it also seemed that the cto seemed to be having some positive effect , as in the months since he had been subject to supervised community treatment , acute admissions to hospital had gone down a bit and the length of time he then spent in hospital had also reduced so i interviewed him , wrote a report , and signed my bit of the cto there s one other thing that leaves me feeling a little uncomfortable about cto s that is , that they are very popular often , it takes quite a while for mental health professionals get used to legal changes like this not so with cto s in a document published in october in patients formally detained in hospitals under the mental health act and patients subject to supervised community treatment , annual figures , england the total number of patients placed on cto s in was , in it had virtually doubled to , over the same period , the number of patients detained under sec only people detained under sec and some forensic sections can be placed on a cto was completely static , at , for and , in this means that within two years of the introduction of cto s nearly of patients detained in hospital under sec were discharged on a cto and since cto s are often being kept in place for a year or more , this could mean a growing accumulation of patient in the community on cto s it may take some convincing that this constitutes the least restrictive option
