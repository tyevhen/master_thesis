recently , an old vice article popped up on my facebook newsfeed , loudly proclaiming all the things that the author believes people are far too old for once they blow out the candles on their th birthday if you 're too lazy to read the article , or if you 're adverse to vice 's how hard can we appeal to that sweet , sweet , something year old college kid demographic brand of journalism , the article basically says that once you 've hit that quarter century mark , you 're too old for fun , friends , fast food , and any recreational activity that is n't enjoying a carefully portioned bowl of bran buds while watching a reasonable political debate and the comments went crazy this is life after , apparently deal with it outraged people over the age of took to the comments section with their torches and pitchforks out , loudly proclaiming that the author was a humourless old fart , and that they themselves were still armpit deep in cocaine and lengthy text messages , thank you very much so while the original author of the vice article plans to live out the rest of his s parked on a rocking chair with shotgun in hand , waiting for children to venture onto his lawn , i 've decided to write my own list of things that my peers and i are far too old for , now that we 're so let 's all agree that we 're too old for huggies pull ups in addition to being bad at literally everything they attempt , small children are terrible at , shall we say , bodily control that 's why we force them to spend part of their formative years in huggies pull ups , which , as far as i can tell , are just diapers that they are n't actually supposed to pee in the design fades like your parents' hopes for your future huggies come in a range of sizes , but it 's not that wide a range if you want the freedom to pee yourself on the go , you 'll have to forego the princess and pixar designs and pick up some plain old adult incontinence diapers totally not worth it those bucket swing seats almost every swing set of your childhood had two types of swing seats regular ones , and those weird bucket ones where you could stash your baby for a bit while you tried to coax your dog into going down the slide these fucking things look , there 's no easy way to say this , so i'm just going to come right out and say it , okay ? you do n't fucking fit in these any more here 's how this is going to go down your friends are going to stand around laughing while you struggle to climb up on top of it and it struggles to get away from you like a childhood pet escaping your overzealous love best case scenario , you fall off of it and sprain your back worst case scenario , you actually succeed at jamming your legs into the tiny leg holes , get stuck , and have to call the fire department to cut you out of the plastic diaper on chains that you 're suddenly entombed in ordering a kids' meal remember happy meals ? i do n't , because my parents loved me enough to cook me real food but i hear that happy meals were just the shit ba da da da daaaaa well , i 've got sad news for you , friend you ca n't order happy meals anymore i mean , you can , if you really want to , but trust me when i say that you 've outgrown children 's menu options at this point in your life , you 're a ravenous wolverine of a human being , bemoaning the fact that the piece nugget bucket is only offered in japan you are n't going to be satisfied with a skant nuggets and a plastic bottle of drinkable yogurt save yourself the embarrassment of ordering four of them and just get adult food plus , they come with apple slices now gross riding public transit for free in most major cities in the world , children under the age of about five do n't have to pay to ride the bus or light rail , confirming my long held suspicions that small children are n't actually people your chariot awaits in all likelihood , you rode the bus for free until you were eight and a half , while your unscrupulous mother shamelessly declared to the bus driver that 'he 's so big for his age ! ' and she got away with it back then but now you 're ' with a five o' clock shadow and you smell like sadness and failure no one is going to believe that you 're under the age of six pay the in bus fare not filing income tax if you 're over and you make money somehow , you have to file income tax like , legally you have to it 's not a choice welcome to adulthood , fucker i mean , sure , tax evasion is a thing but if federal tax agencies can take down al capone , they can sure as hell nail you for setting your t on fire on the lawn just send all your tax forms to your dad , and whine until he files them for you i said you had to file taxes , i did n't say you had to be an adult about it playing in the ball pit at fast food restaurants when you were a kid , you probably remember having a blast in the ball pit every time your mom was too overwhelmed to cook and packed you into the car to get some nugget shaped chicken parts for dinner since you lacked the emotional maturity to handle soda and ketchup dispensers , you were banished to the ball pit to play while she wrestled all of your paper containers of cholesterol to a table as a child , you could frolic in one of these things with reckless abandon , safe in the childlike knowledge that a large corporation had your health and safety as their priority today , your cynical or older self knows full well that the average ball pit is comprised of used band aids and urine of all missing children are actually stuck to a piece of chewed gum at the bottom of a ball pit your well honed adult instincts for disease wo n't let you go near one of these things also you 're pretty sure a concerned parent will call the police if you do asking your parents before going online you ever seen a commercial for a children 's website , or some toy with an online component ? you 're going to hear the phrase ask your parents' permission before going online , because the legal departments of large companies need to give themselves plausible deniability , just in case they accidentally lure a child into interacting with club penguin 's thriving pedophile underground although , let 's be real , you 're definitely already banned from club penguin now you 're too old for pedophiles to want you they 're not interested you do n't need to ask your mom 's permission to go online , because if she was worried you 'd get snatched up by a balding stranger in an unmarked minivan , she would n't have forced you to move out three years ago enrolling in the second grade when you were or years old or an year old half asser , someone enrolled you in the second grade you might have done it at a public school , a private school , or a private school that taught you nothing but yoga poses and chanting regardless , you legally had to do it it was n't an option pictured you in a second grade class today today , that 's just not an option for you even if you half assed your way through school so hard that you are n't finished the second grade by age , there 's no way the parents are going to let you sit in class with their kids while your seven year old classmates are learning the proper names for their private parts , you 'll be squirming in your seat from the wicked case of gonorrhea you refuse to get checked out it 's weird , man thinking audiocassettes are cool audio cassettes were the shit back in , mostly because cds were expensive back then and your parents did n't trust you not to get your fingerprints all over the shiny side but it was okay , because you had your tapes you could use them to record off the radio you could take them with you in your awesome walkman man , tapes were cool all the gradually worsening quality of a cd , with the added fun of rewinding ! yeah , it 's now audio cassettes are bullshit approximately of my early childhood was spent rewinding these things to the exact spot where my favourite song actually started , and another was spent standing over them with a screwdriver , trying frantically to stuff all eight feet of snarled plastic tape back on the little wheels half my songs started with a four second clip of some idiot radio jockey reminding me that i'm listening to a radio station that no longer exists youtube exists now be thankful measuring your self worth by comparing yourself to a bratz doll every year , millions of little girls will wake up on christmas morning to find bratz dolls nestled under the tree , despite the fact that parents and teachers agree that these things give young girls crippling self esteem issues at least three or four years earlier than we would like i have seen the face of god , and he was weeping at age , it 's easy to look at a bratz doll and think that that 's what a human woman should look like , because year olds are stupid at , your reaction to this grotesque plastic abomination is one of utmost disgust look at that thing her eyes say i come to this planet in peace , but her lips say anaphylactic shock if you witnessed a human bratz doll tottering down the street on inch heels with a inch waistline , you 'd keep a priest on speed dial for the rest of your life not comprehending the ever looming spectre of death that hangs over us all when you were a kid , nothing really died spot went off to live on a farm grandma took a long vacation to heaven unless you grew up in a tragic lifetime movie , your family and friends were immortal just as immortal as you honestly , the first five years of your life were just one long attempt to kill and or maim yourself ha , guess again , fucker everything you love is fleeting and doomed to die you 're always just one tiny misstep away from being run down by a drunken ambulance driver rushing to the scene of an auto erotic asphyxiation now , every time you forget to text your mother back , a little voice in the back of your head says she 's going to die someday , and you 'll never get to talk to her again every time your partner is late coming home , you 'll immediately worry that they 've been killed in a freak accident , and the last words you ever said to them were by the way , we 're out of toilet paper you 're old enough to know that death is never far away , and there 's nothing you can do to get rid of that knowledge you 're just going to think about it every now and then until you die being sentenced as a juvenile getting charged as a juvenile is awesome , as far as the whole facing criminal charges things go your name gets kept out of the press in most cases , your record gets sealed when you 're you 're a whole lot less likely to go to prison in the first place , and even if you do end up there , you 're still less likely to have to share a cell with a year old serial child molester named bubba or perhaps this upstanding gentleman but the thing about facing charges as a juvenile is that you have to be , well , a juvenile which you are n't , and have n't been for at least five years if you get drunk and rob a with a can of axe body spray and a barbeque lighter , you 're going to big boy prison bubba is waiting holding your mom 's hand when you cross the street when you were little , you probably had to hold on to an adult 's hand to cross the street no one actually enjoyed coming into contact with your grubby little fingers , but this was a necessary practice to prevent you from hurling yourself under the wheels of an oncoming semi truck because , as we previously discussed , kids suck at keeping themselves alive now , there 's no way you can hold your mother 's hand in public no , not because it 'd embarass you , you dumbass you embarass her are those the sweatpants she bought you in the th grade that you 're wearing ? how do you even still have those ? and when was the last time you showered ? did you really think that side shaved haircut was a good idea ? nope , cross the street by yourself if you get hit by a car , it 'll serve you right flying as an unaccompanied minor when you were a kid , if you had to take an airplane trip by yourself , the stewards , stewardesses and airline staff were instructed to check on you once in a while , just to make sure you got on the right plane and were n't accidentally stabbing yourself to death with the airline issued cutlery that came with your dinner now you 're on your own , fucker if you somehow manage to accidentally board a flight to zimbabwe and open up your jugular with a badly executed fork manoeuvre , that 's your own damn problem , because the lady in the third row needs another tiny glass of wine and you are a goddamned adult your days of unaccompanied minorhood are over , because the airlines literally wo n't give you that designation anymore gleaning safety from sitting in rear facing car seats when you were a small child , the safest way for you to travel was in a rear facing car seat i think it has something to do with cushioning the impact on your tiny neck in a head on collision i do n't know , i do n't study baby physics what i do know is that rear facing carseats are no longer a safe option for the over pictured a human who requires much less legroom than you do for real , it 's not safe you do n't even fit in that thing anymore if you get in an accident , you 're just going to get launched out the front windshield and probably kick the driver in the face on the way by all your friends will die , because you could n't let go of the fact that being strapped to a baby seat is no longer your safest option sit in your big boy seat yes , with the seatbelt on not catching the sex jokes in cartoons the cartoons you watched as a child were magical , flawless paragons of wholesome entertainment the good guys won , the bad guys lost , the hero got the girl , and you played that lion king vhs tape over and over again until your parents wanted to abandon you in the middle of the actual serengeti every so often , in the middle of your cartoons , your parents would chuckle at a comment you did n't think was a joke , but you never really thought much of it adults are strange also known as jokes you stumbled across while stoned out of your gourd in your dorm room at am adults are also gross , and it was a whole bunch of gross adults who wrote , directed and animated all those childrens' shows you used to watch apparently , working on a kids' show in the s was an endless slog of monotonous pandering to children that could only be relieved by tossing in a reference to the eight year old protagonists boning long gone are the days when those jokes sailed right over your head , and no longer will cartoons be your safe haven from the depravity of the world singing taylor swift 's '' and really meaning those lyrics i do n't know about you but i'm feeling everything will be alright if you keep me next to you you do n't know about me but i 'll bet you want to everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we 're , ooh ooh , ooh ooh you know who really means the shit out of those lyrics ? year olds or the year old who recorded them sure , you can still sing along to this song but deep down , in your heart of hearts , you know it just felt a lot more authentic last year , when you were actually years old and it 'll never quite feel right to you ever again believing that santa brings your christmas gifts believing in santa claus was awesome all you had to do was be less of a little shit than usual every december because let 's face it , santa 's performance reviews were less than comprehensive , and bam , a magical fat bearded man would break into your house and leave you a bunch of shit it was great best home invasion ever but now that you 're older , it 's time to realize that santa is not a literal being , but a role that adults have to play during the holidays there 's no way that one man could deliver gifts to every christian ish house on earth in a single night , because it 's going to take you all of december to purchase , wrap and deliver gift for the three or so people on your list leaving the work to santa at this stage of your life is just going to lead to a whole lot of disappointment all around sitting in your uncle 's lap you spent most of your early childhood seated in the laps of various relatives this was partly because you were still adorable back then , and partly because your parents did n't want to spend money on teeny tiny chairs for you and in every family , there was one uncle in particular who enjoyed having you in his lap this uncle it was this one today , there 's no way that would fly for one , your microwaved burrito and pizza pop diet has long since caught up to you , and you ca n't sit on anyone 's lap without cutting off circulation to their lower legs and for two , it 's weird now you 'd shift around to get comfortable he 'd clear his throat you 'd avoid eye contact at family events for the rest of your lives not being able to buy alcohol remember high school ? when you could n't get into a bar , and the only way you could get your much needed underage drinking done was to go to befriend that one kid with rich parents who liked to go out of town waaaay too often and leave the liquor cabinet unlocked it was that , or wait for somebody 's cool mom to just buy it for you unless you live in select areas of rural india , those days are long over if you want to get shitfaced on vodka , just go to a liquor store and buy some you have id and you smell like a student loan you can do it expecting your every achievement to be posted on your parents' fridge childhood achievements did n't really matter unless they made it onto the fridge door your parents told you that your macaroni picture was good , but if your parents did n't post it in a place of honour on the fridge , you knew it was a piece of shit garbage but at your age , it 's not reasonable to expect your parents to display your achievements on their fridge , mostly because you have n't achieved anything in years yeah , okay , that diploma in art history looks nice on the office wall , but what have you done since then ? you expect them to hang up that one visa bill you actually managed to pay on time ? pathetic peeing your pants in public we already established at the beginning of this list that you 're physically too large for huggies pull ups so what 's the year old or older to do when he wants to void himself in public ? nope nope nope nope nope nope you ca n't i'm sorry that 's the hard truth of it unless you 're battling some rare and awful bladder condition , the public will have no sympathy for you when you wet yourself at the movie theatre when a four year old does it , it 's almost kind of cute when a year old does it , it 's reason to call the police taking life advice from goddamn lists look , at the end of the day , you 're an adult you can have skittles for dinner if you want to you can marry a year old sex offender you 've only met through prison correspondence you can invest your entire life savings in stockpiling cans of spray cheese none of these things are good idea , but you can do them if you want to , because you 're an adult and no one can stop you tastes like sweet , sweet freedom so if you want to say 'screw you' and hold your mother 's hand while you cross the street to your nearest elementary school to drop off a registration form for mrs applewood 's second grade class , you do you , you magnificent animal do n't let me stop you because taking advice from online lists is dumb
