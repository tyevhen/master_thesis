it was november i had been trying for a baby since my previous incident an abortion when i first met my children 's dad i fell pregnant months into the relationship i most definitely was not ready for a baby i worked full time in a job i loved which i studied for years i had just got my brand new first car , life was good for me then i missed my period i took a test and i was pregnant i was in severe shock i did n't know what to do i felt sick numb and scared ! i was i did n't want to tell my mum as i was scared and i was not about that life i did n't want kids till i was almost if you ask anyone that knew me including family they would tell you straight paris would be the last person i 'd thought would have kids ! and it was true anyway long story short i thought through with the decision for a few weeks and being young nd confused still then i do n't think i thought through well enough i just knew the time was not right because i was n't with my children 's dad for long enough time to start a family it was all new in the relationship and a baby is for life i do n't want to just be a failure and rush into things because you cannot predict the future and nothing lasts for ever literally so i aborted my baby at the time in my head i thought it was for the best i had so much going for me i did n't want to start that sort of life just yet i wanted to be engaged , married have a house all that malarkey before i have kids too late now and i went ahead and had the surgery being caught up in all these emotions i came out balling my eyes out i began to fall into deep depression i hated life i hated myself i did n't want to live anymore i could n't believe i did what i did for weeks i beat myself up over it i quit my dream job i did n't eat sleep drink nothing my mum took me away on holiday to egypt and still i was suicidal i was a wreck all i wanted was my baby back i never knew once it was gone i 'd feel the way i did i never even met it before and i was completely heartbroken i knew i was n't ready but i did n't think i 'd ever feel the way i did i grieved for weeks and then months later i fell pregnant with my daughter mona we both grieved so much and talked about everything , planned everything and it was november exactly months after the abortion i had the chance to fall pregnant again i was so happy i could 've ran a mile i was blooming ! could not stop smiling as soon as i found out i was pregnant i booked my appointment in the doctors i went baby shopping i looked and what i'm going to buy him her i did all what normal first mums do i was sent my first scan at weeks i was so excited , i went to that saw my baby first time on the screen and i was just amazed my tiny little size body has a baby inside it 's a crazy feeling i never had morning sickness with mona i never had nothing i just had bizarre cravings like hot peppers and fizzy coke from mcdonald 's i'm a beautician and worked in salons and spa 's doing intense work so i had to go part time up until months because it literally killed me and i did n't want anything happening to my baby i worked my ass of for her to have the nicest things and at months i had to leave my job and get a job in an office because i kept bleeding due to so much stress and over working myself and all the strain of my job i was in and out of hospital and she was fine thank god i just had to take it easy it got to nearer the end of my pregnancy and i came on maternity leave at the very last month of my pregnancy i hated it i hated sitting around being bored and not active i always worked from the age of so for me to not be working it was weird so i pampered myself got my hair done nails done rested for time was just being pure lazy i left all my big buys to the very end i did n't buy the buggy , cot etc till the very end of my pregnancy and as i slowly went on in the pregnancy i would buy all the clothes and baby grows etc throughout and i left the buggy etc all till the very end so then by the time she was due i had it all delivered in time to be put up within having the whole month of no work and on maternity leave i just tried so much to sleep and enjoy my very last days of me being alone because once the baby is here that 's it , sleepless nights start and you never get rest and you 'll never get to do the things you could re being a mum the main thing to do is to rest and take things easy i worked so hard and was continuously stressed throughout my pregnancy that she came days early i worked my ass of to give her the best but in reality you do n't need to buy all these expensive things because they grow so quick and they end up wearing it a few times and then all the money is wasted i got mona a i ca n't which came to and she only had it a year which was not worth the money at all it 's all for fashion and competition but if i could have done it again i would have spent the money on something else or saved it in a bank for her , because all the money i spent on mona she had it for less than a month if that !
