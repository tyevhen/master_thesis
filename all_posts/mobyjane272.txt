in my struggle with anxiety since my back injury i have been faithfully saying the coue phrase over and over i start out with everyday in every way i'm getting better and better and it morphs into day by day in every way i'm getting better and better i not only say the phrase times in the morning before i get up and at night before i go to sleep but anytime i think of it during the day it 's sure better than some of the anxious thoughts that pop up on their own as soon as i get one i switch to the affirmation it 's the simple process of thought choice replacing a wrong thought with a right thought here 's how i get from beta level to alpha level at night when i go to sleep i did pick up one helpful coue hint which was easy to add to my technique because it is to be used at the very beginning so i now start with staring above my head , as far back as i can until my eyes get heavy then i close my eyes , relax the muscles around my eyes , let that relaxation go to the rest of my my body by starting with my toes and going through my feet , my legs etc , saying relax , relax and relaxing each body part then i take a deep breath and count down , then then then i say deeper and deeper i say these things in my mind , not aloud then i count down from , , deeper and deeper , , deeper and deeper , deeper and deeper then sometimes i count really fast several times to block any intruding thoughts taking deep breaths and then i start to say in a barely audible voice the repeats day by day in every way i am getting better and better and one small triumph i noticed the other day that my feet were always sweaty lately when i took off my socks for any reason they were just wet this is not usual so i figured it was part of the anxiety i noticed last night that my feet were no longer sweating
