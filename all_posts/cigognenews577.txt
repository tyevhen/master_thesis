we have all met them they are the conscience free , manipulative , unfeeling and uncaring humans if i may say thatthat leave a well of destruction wherever they go they know nothing of love or helping and above all , of gratitude once you give they want more and only see you as a sucker and pigeon who can be worked for more how did that happen ? i could quote statistics you know that a recent study of psychopaths found that they have damage in their feeling centers no surprise there see a brain gone wrong scientific american mind , sept but we get that they cannot feel and they cannot empathize they do not seem to have the capacity for it they have the shell of a human without the internal mechanisms that gives us our humanity they have learned how to act charming , the better to manipulate others by obtaining their trust first but it is short lived and then the truth comes out they care about no one there are partial psychopaths who have some of these traits but manage to care once in a while , sporadically and with no depth of feeling nevertheless , they seem to be human they do not scam or cheat others but they are not against it if they have to look at the driving business man or politician for examples they raise prices , the rent , anything , because they care about themselves and profits and not others they need to get return not matter what it means to others they don t hate others but they love themselves more that is not exactly true since they really have little love to give even to themselves the politicians care about votes and staying in power we all know that they will say anything to stay in office they are master manipulators and are able to twist other s needs to make them vote against themselves and their needs they all care not about others it is no doubt the sine qua non of going into politics there are some exceptions and you know who they are they tell the truth , which is why they cannot stay in office this damage to the limbic feeling structures can happen during womblife and is highly exacerbated right afterward when there is an absence of close human contact perhaps weeks in an incubator with little or not human warmth then to compound matters there is indifferent unloving parents who never touch the child i say that there is an emotional band missing they seem to be short on feelings it can begin when the mother is chronically anxious or depressed while carrying they baby suffers and is already damaged before coming onto this planet so what about morality ? psychopaths seem to be immoral , but they are unfeeling that is what the research evidence shows they cannot feel or empathize with others so they , as clinton said in reverse , cannot feel their pain so anything goes they cheat their closest friends , a la bernard madoff they don t feel bad about this immoral behavior because they cannot feel the pain they are causing cheating people out of their life s savings without a hint of caring their feeling band is missing and nothing anyone can do can put it back that is why when they are caught they can never confess to their crimes it is always someone else s fault we in primal therapy cannot treat them because they incorporate the therapy into their psychopathy and often decide to become therapists with no training they harm many people and advertise so well that they con many they scream and yell we have taken them out of prison for the court but never feel they go through the motions of being human without being human we cannot give them back a full brain the damage is too early and too severe a research study at king s college , in london , came out explaining the origins of the psychopath he remains as i have described him and psychopaths are mostly males but the origin of the personality disorder needs to be pushed back a few weeks in the study , the investigators used an imaging scan mri , on psychopaths killers , rapists , etc , and concluded that there were differences in their brains from those in the general population two of the culprits were the prefrontal area of the cortex , and aspects of the amygdala there was an impairment between the connections in those two areas in a normal brain , when there are emotionally stimulating events , the amygala responds but in psychopaths there is a breakdown in this response the grounds for this condition , set up before birth , are exacerbated by birth trauma and lack of human contact right after birth it would seem that in psychopaths the neural circuitry that connects feelings to higher level brain processes is deficient another way to put it is that feelings are not part of the conceptual , day to day cortical functioning so while the person can be charming on the exterior , there are no sincere feelings underlying this facade it is all a dumb show perhaps if the trauma did not exist before birth to damage the connection between nerve cells responsible for feelings and those in charge of comprehension the lack of touch after birth would not have such disastrous effects however , when there is a pre birth impairment of the connections between feelings and thoughts , the lack of physical contact right after birth is catastrophic the result can be someone who not only has no control over his impulses but also has no means to experience his feelings there may be learning but not emotionally integrated learning the implications of the study were that psychopathy , in fact , could be a brain disease i think it is more likely explained by epigenetic trauma the important lesson , though , is that psychopathy , much like other aberrations in development , bears the signature of what went wrong earlier in our lives memories are made indelible in our biology because they form guides to our future , instructions on how to behave in order to survive that is , they become part of our apperceptive mass always ready to serve our interest for survival here is what one of my students wrote psychopaths shed light on a crucial subset of decision making that 's referred to as morality morality can be a squishy , vague concept , and yet , at its simplest level , it 's nothing but a series of choices about how we treat other people when you act in a moral manner when you recoil from violence , treat others fairly , and help strangers in need you are making decisions that take people besides yourself into account you are thinking about the eelings of others , sympathizing with their states of mind this is what psychopaths ca n't do they are missing the primal emotional cues that the rest of us use as guides when making moral decisions the psychopath 's brain is bored by expressions of terror the main problem seems to be a broken amygdala , a brain area responsible for propagating aversive emotions such as fear and anxiety as a result , psychopaths never feel bad when they make other people feel bad hurting someone else is just another way of getting what he wants , a perfectly reasonable way to satisfy desires the absence of emotion makes the most basic moral concepts incomprehensible g k chesterton was right the madman is not the man who has lost his reason the madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason reported in science daily , august , d murphy , marco catani and michael craig aug , see also , michael craig , altered connections on the road to psychopath in molecular psychiatry , doi pg
