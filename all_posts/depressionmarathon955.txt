i had a day interrupted by intrusive thoughts intrusive thoughts are disturbing , aggressive , repetitive thoughts which barge into one 's mind that 's my definition , anyway my intrusive thoughts are n't necessarily based in reality , and sometimes they do n't even make sense today , my disturbing thoughts were about puck over and over i had visions of someone arbitrarily entering my yard and shooting him , or of someone driving over him while he struggled to get out of the way why puck ? why today ? my best guess ? i'm still traumatized by last week 's attack i do find it odd that i had scary , intrusive thoughts today i 've been feeling better i do n't think i 've ever had intrusive thoughts while my symptoms have essentially been in remission this was a new day and that 's why i'm noting it here i was surprised by the disturbing thoughts i did n't realize i would or could have these damn thoughts while feeling well apparently , i was wrong i guess i 'll have to refine my definition of intrusive thoughts intrusive thoughts are disturbing , aggressive , repetitive thoughts which barge into one 's mind , and they can occur at any time
