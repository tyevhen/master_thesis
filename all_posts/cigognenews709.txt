in the early nineteenth century a french scientist named jean baptiste lamarck decided that we acquired characteristics from experiences that our parents underwent russian communists applied this to agriculture but , no matter , it was a widely discredited theory until recently now this avowed marxist position may have been resurrected a bit there is a new field called epigenetics that states pretty much what lamarck believed so what is the evidence ? and what exactly is it ? what lamarck said was that individuals acquire characteristics as a result of their environment , and now , these characteristics can be passed on to the offspring much of the work in epigenetics has to do with diet a mother s diet influences the offspring s physiology epigenetics has to do with how genes are regulated and influenced by the experience of the baby i believe it has more to do with the fetus who resides in the womb that his experience is influenced forevermore by the mother s diet but also by her moods , her anxiety and depression has the genetic switch been delayed or was it premature ? this can happen without making a radical change in the gene itself but rather in how it is expressed , whether it is shut off or on what we are discussing is how a mother s interaction with her environment can pass this on to her offspring i think we need to understand that a fetus in the womb is always trying to adapt to his environment and that how genes will evolve and be expressed depends on that adaptation for example , a mother who is anxious and who has depleted much of her serotonin supplies cannot fulfill the young fetal need for his own serotonin supplies he may well grow up deficient in inhibitory or repressive capacity and be an anxiety case forevermore this evolves into attention deficit in his youth and his continued inability to have a cohesive cognitive ability i think it is extremely important that all this occurs while the fetal brain is rapidly developing and needs proper input to evolve normally an anxious mother is so agitated that the neuronal input into the baby she is carrying is so extreme that he cannot adapt and integrate this input thereafter , this is the kind of person who cannot accept too much stimulation because the internal input is so great that anything from the outside , just two terms papers , can be overwhelming i have discussed the work of michael meaney of mcgill university who has worked with mice and found that very early neglect by the mother results in lifelong alterations in thirteen men who had committed suicide , all of whom suffered from child abuse , there were epigenetic effects abuse has many forms but to me those most deleterious is the abuse of a mother who smokes , drinks or takes drugs during pregnancy abuse means adversely affect a child s development meaney found the same changes in thirty five people who suffered from schizophrenia here , several of the genes involved with the unfurling of key neurotransmitters which ordinarily help to repress pain or noxious stimuli where affected new work has related epigenetics to the occurrence of cancer what has been called the effects on epigenetic settings i call changing the set points of many biologic states this includes the set points of the neurotransmitters that w ill later make us chronically comfortable or uncomfortable not feeling good in our skin is one way to state it what is very new is that experiences of the mother affects the sperm of the offspring , and that may affect how the grandchildren develop it may be that smoking or drug taking in while the embryo is just forming can later affect sperm production the meaning of all this is that what happens in the womb while the organism is getting organized can affect the baby for a lifetime it is so important that we not neglect this period when we attempt to understand and treat those with emotional problems the more remote the imprint the more widespread the later effects , in my opinion when a carrying mother is under stress her stress hormone level is high when the levels remain high for a long time the immune system is compromised , and that might well affect the immune status of the offspring and as i note elsewhere , a strong immune system natural killer cells is needed to stay on the lookout for newly developing cancer cells it is not that a deficient immune system can lead to cancer , it is that a weak maternal immune system does not impart a strong immune capability to the baby and the same dislocated physiology of the mother can also affect the fetus , setting the stage for later catastrophic disease womb life has largely been neglected in the psychological literature it is time to reorient ourselves small feet and small breasts cancer ? are small feet and small breasts desireable ? is it good or bad ? it s more serious than that it is neither good nor bad but whether that size has arrived at its genetic destination that is , due to heredity has the size fulfilled the genetic intention ? if not , there can be serious repercussions what it means to me , and now we leave the arena of strict science , is that repression has interceded to slow down or inhibit growth how do i know ? some of my patients have reported foot growth , chest growth , breast growth and other kinds of growth after about a year of therapy we have a letter of a former patient who reported foot growth of several sizes after therapy all that has happened in my therapy is lifting repression and liberating pain if we reason backward we might say that repression probibited proper growth from taking place that means to me constant pressure in key sites against growth against genetic destinations and that again can mean the possibility of serious illness , possibly cancer pressure on the cells to stop this unfolding can be enormous until one has seen the liberation of pain it is difficult to comprehend so we can only say that one s breasts are too small when we see if they grow as a result of this liberation and i believe that will only happen when the patient arrives at deeply implanted pain , at birth and before , when so many hormones are affected where so many set points are dislocated and fixed i think that , in this sense , the therapy may have an anti cancer effect can you imagine the pressure our biology exerts to fulfill its genetic promise ? that pressure continues against a constant pressure to hold it back the result too often can be disease as the cells become deformed and dislocated it is not only the obvious breasts and feet , which are , after all , measureable , but there my be so effects we cannot measure for example , the kidneys , heart or liver we see that wherever we have looked , serotonin impramine natural killer cells there are significant changes we would expect the same with key organ systems in other words , pain and repression are laid down as total experience , which means that just about every system is involved in the imprint of the memory so we would expect that all key organ systems would be affected that remains to be studied but we would also expect that those systems , which are inherently weak and vulnerable , would be seriously affected by that repression the answer ? have a good gestation and birth and infancy failing that , relive the key pains set down and undo the massive repression there are effects we cannot measure for example , the kidneys , heart or liver we see that wherever we have looked , serotonin impramine natural killer cells there are significant changes we would expect the same with key organ systems in other words , pain and repression are laid down as total experience , which means that just about every system is involved in the imprint of the memory so we would expect that all key organ systems would be affected that remains to be studied but we would also expect that those systems , which are inherently weak and vulnerable , would be seriously affected by that repression the answer ? have a good gestation and birth and infancy failing that , relive the key pains set down and undo the massive repression in writing about the imprint , i will note again that one way we know that very early imprinted pain endures is that many entering patients have high stress hormone levels which normalize after one year of the therapy what this may mean is that the imprint endures , is a constant danger , and must be fought against that danger is signaled by the high cortisol stress hormone levels why is it , then , that the levels come down to normal after a time ? because the imprint is no longer a force it is now simply a memory the force of the pain has been felt and integrated it is not as though there is a reliving of the memory and then we find changes in the imprint it is that the way the memory is held and engraved is through these various changes such as in stress hormone levels the danger is no longer in evidence the system can relax the battle is over as all systems normalize it means that there is no longer an irrevocable memory to deal with the imprint as a total physiologic event no longer exists can we become neurotic again ? not in the same way because the harmful memory is gone what we often cannot change are the secondary changes already in evidence due to the damage inflicted beforehand
