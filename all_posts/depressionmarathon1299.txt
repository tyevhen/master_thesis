whew ! tough week legs really tired this week many runs required hours of motivational self talk to get out the door and occassionally a fully clothed running clothes , that is nap , too ! gotta get back in the pool , i think , to give my legs a little regeneration time , but i know i may not have the energy to swim and run , so i have been hesitant to swim and potentially miss more runs it 's a game of craps , this depression i cannot know if the dice will allow another roll , or if the house will take all of my energy , leaving me broke after only the first toss ! it 's a crap shoot and with that , here 's week four of the garry bjorklund half marathon training program week four march april , ran days miles long run miles speedwork ugh ! only about mile at tempo pace found money have an energetic week everyone !
