i just returned home from my evening kettlebell weight training class , which ended three extra long , extra busy days of work and life attempting to fix myself something to eat after class , i suddenly realized i felt faint i'm not close to passing out or anything , but i am totally wiped out ! my muscles , cardiovascular system , and brain are all on empty i knew i was tired before the class began i got home from work with only about minutes to spare prior to class beginning i could feel the fatigue in my muscles and my brain as i got ready to go i actually thought about skipping class if it was a scheduled run , i probably would have skipped it , but we are expected to attend every kettlebell class i rather would have taken a nap well , not surprisingly , the class was tougher than usual i was winded from the start , but i took more time than usual transitioning between exercises , mini breaks , and made it work unfortunately , now i can barely keep myself upright i'm really pooped ! i'm a little concerned , as i sit here feeling like a wet dish rag , because i plan to run miles tomorrow typically i would run long on saturday , but i have a short race on saturday , which most of my co workers are doing , so i want to run it , too also , d is coming this weekend i do n't want to waste hours of our time together running alone it will be best if i can get the done tomorrow , but we 'll see i'm really looking forward to my day away from work tomorrow i do have plenty of things to accomplish before d 's arrival on friday , but hopefully a good night 's sleep will help me recover and energize i think it will be an early night tonight i 'll let you know how it all works out
