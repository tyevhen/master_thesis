so i'm a little older than i used to be and recently when i look in the mirror , i 've noticed some lines in my forehead when i make specific expressions i'm not so sure i like them when they show up in photos , they definitely make me look older and yet , i know that these lines are n't just from aging , they are an occupational hazard part of attentive listening in psychotherapy involves using your face to convey , in non verbal ways , obviously , feelings and expressions and interest and even questions these are my quizzical lines really ? do n't you think you 're kidding yourself there ? give me a break not a word gets uttered , but oh so much gets communicated in silence , with the movement of just a few muscles yes , clink , here and there i have a moment of silence a short moment , but still wrinkles as an occupational hazard every now and then i have the thought that maybe i should botox those lines away , but my first thought is always , will it interfere with my work ? who am i as a psychiatrist without the quizzical look ? will my patients relate to me differently ? will they have worse different better therapeutic outcomes if my facial muscles are paralyzed ? oh , and since they came from my work , can i tax deduct the cost of botox treatments ? no worries , i 'll stay wrinkled or quizzical as long as clink continues to be a nun look a like and roy remains a geek
