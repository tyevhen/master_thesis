last sunday , days ago , i ran miles under sunshine with temps in the mid seventies today , days later , i ran miles under gray skies with temps at or below zero ! yikes ! as the sub zero windchill froze my face this morning , i smiled at the divergent conditions hard to believe i was so warm only one week ago but at least i was back on the road earlier this week , i suffered a bit of let down following the austin marathon it was n't too bad , just enough to make me nervous i felt low i was eating a lot of crap , and i took one more day off than i had planned before i was able to convince myself to get back to it i'm back to training , but i'm still not happy with how i'm eating i do n't feel good about myself when i throw junk down my throat , yet i continue to do it baffling tomorrow i start a new weight watchers week , and i hope to get back to my sensible eating program then that would be the final step in reversing this let down i'm glad i'm back on the road because last night i realized boston is only weeks away for some reason , i thought there was more time between the two marathons than that it 's not a big deal it just means slightly more accelerated training than i had planned that 's why i ran , rather than , today i just wish the road was a little warmer ! and sunnier is that too much to ask ?
