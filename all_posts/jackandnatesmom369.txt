i am always talking about nate 's aba and have even posted some pics , but his home therapist came today and i thought , why not take a little video , so i did you will see that the goals we are striving toward are really very simple , it does n't make the fact that nate touched his nose on command today mean any less though ! love my little boy and i am very very proud of him here he is identifying a picture of a dog , even when moved to a different position this is kind of a prep for when they do multiple different pictures and have him point to the correct one simple imitation stacking of blocks pretty self explanatory identifying pictures of people with a second picture used as a distractor working on fitting puzzle pieces this was not his norm , he usually does this pretty easily , and unfortunately my video limit was reached on my i phone before he did it but he did get it eventually !
