back in the late s , when , was a lot of money , i scored a five figure book advance on a hard cover book with a major new york publisher the story of how that came about is kind of interesting , but i 'll save it for another day i thought , at the time , i had really hit it big the day i signed the contract was the happiest day of my young life up to that point it does n't get any better than this , i thought there would be many more happiest day of my life experiences , i hasten to add , none involving publishing but then came an educational process right there is your clue educational process being code language for painful experience , which most authors go through , wherein i learned how the publishing business actually works more code language i was disabused of certain myths like all wet behind the ears young authors , i thought my big name publisher would put some bigtime marketing resources behind my book it was a specialty book , so i was n't completely unrealistic about what might happen i did n't expect to see it in macy 's window , but still , i thought surely , they 'll promote the heck out of this thing , make it visible to my target audience with magazine ads and whatnot yeah , that 's really what i thought instead insert sound of crickets chirping what i learned , of course , is that how the world works and how you think it should work are two different things authors think okay , if you publish a thousand titles , and there 's a marketing budget of x , surely you spend roughly of x on each book maybe a little more for books with special potential , and a little less for books that sell themselves , like bestsellers completely wrong let me tell you how it works if you 're a publisher , you pump marketing money into your winners in hopes of making them even bigger winners the stragglers , the losers , the backlist stuff , the specialty items obscure titles only a few customers will buy those are the titles you do n't lavish money on , because no amount of marketing is going to make a slow seller pay for itself you 'll only make a slow seller less profitable by spending money on it what you do is promote your winners , and with any luck , they 'll make enough money to carry the rest of the catalog for the rest of the sales year i suspect the music business works pretty much the same way because really , all businesses work this way if you 're a company of any kind toy company , restaurant , shoe company , you name it and you have ten different product lines , one of which is consistently profitable , of which break even , and of which lose money , which products are you going to promote ? think of the product lines as individual businesses of their own do you invest money in a profitable company , or an unprofitable one ? turn the question around and the answer 's even easier which product line do you get rid of , if you 're forced to get rid of one ? answer the one that 's least likely to make money when you truly understand the foregoing principle in all its ramifications , you 're ready to open a lemonade stand until then , do n't go into business my book an aviation title ended up doing reasonably well for a book of its kind a specialty book it got chosen as the main selection by two aviation book clubs and went into a foreign edition it fell short of paying back the advance , however , and when the first printing finally hit an inventory level of zero , the publisher chose not to do a second printing they sold the rights to me for one dollar , and said not in these exact words here you go , you can publish it yourself now go crazy with it
