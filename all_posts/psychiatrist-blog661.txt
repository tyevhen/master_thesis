like dinah , i also was thinking of writing something i went to twitter , and saw that many people were saying what they were doing at the time of hearing about the attacks it made me think for the umpteenth time where i was and what i was doing at that time if any of you readers would like to describe what you were doing on , the day of the terrorist attacks , please feel free to do so in the comments i was in my private practice office at gbmc seeing my first patient of the day a very healthy , but very anxious older man with frequent physical complaints very nice guy we were just finishing a therapy session am and i sent him out and was writing my note my office was in a hospital office building in a suite run by a primary care physician , so there were also several exam rooms , a large front office with a receptionist and two office staff , and a waiting room with maybe a dozen chairs the first plane hit at am et detailed timeline here on wikipedia my am patient , a middle aged woman with even more anxiety problems whom i had helped with a severe benzo addiction , came back early to tell me that a plane had crashed into one of the twin towers in ny and that another one was heading to dc my initial reaction was disbelief she must have gotten that wrong i go out to the front office where everyone is crowded around a tv , listening to the news my am patient is still there she was my last patient of the day everyone else cancelled if they had n't , i would have the day was filled with fear , uncertainty , and doubt but there was a camaraderie we all grew closer with this common experience the images , burned into our collective brains the one peaceful image that equally burned into my brain for four days i gazed for long periods at the sky in amazed wonder not a single plane not a single jet entrail drifting across the sky this must be what the sky looks like in wyoming , i recall thinking beautiful ! i'm tearing up just thinking about it now i 've still never made it to wyoming but i will never forget
