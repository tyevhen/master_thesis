when the energy of an imprint is blocked , we have little access to ourselves this also suggests why depression often involves being sexless , as the system is in the energy conservation mode parasympathetic all energy is suppressed the underlying pain has demanded that so much energy be expended in repression that there is little left over for other things and the memory endures , keeping the system off balance where the parasympathetic system is dominant tranquilizers that repress pain often suppress sex drive , as well we produce those same inhibitory substances internally , and can shut ourselves down just as readily as with drugs if anything that should tell us that we react holistically which is the example of tranquilizers they suppress pain in a global way and along with it the sex drive it is not that they target sex specifically , but that when targeting a whole system it must necessarily include sex that is why the imprint is set down systemically it is why non sexual and pre sexual traumas directly affect sex we see it so clearly when patients on prozac , which is a serotonin enhancer , have diminished sex drive but find it difficult to believe that the very same chemical we produce internally can also shut off sex drive now we can begin to see the origin of some sex problems problems that will not respond to any conventional treatments a reliving of a brainstem imprint necessarily involves a brainstem reaction without the reliving there is a still a brainstem reaction going on which affects sex , yet the memory is out of awareness fortunately , resolving sex problems such as diminished libido by lifting depression can occur without one word addressed about them , per se the more we feel what caused the closure of our system , the more it becomes safe for the system to be open this occurs not all at once , but over time i discount age here clearly , an eighty year old is going to have diminished sex drive , as is someone who is very sick they have less energy available , hence less energy for sex we are captives of our biology and our imprints , not its masters once there is an imprint , once memory has become neuro physiological , we react to our history first and external reality second inner life is pre potent because it has to do with survival we then see the world through the filter of history it is why under completely calm conditions we have palpitations the imprint sculpts new circuits in the nervous system so that certain networks get grooved and are more likely to be used again and again later on , that groove may be sexual and compulsive so that each time pain comes up the excitation by pain is transformed into sexual compulsion it is in the limbic system that the compulsion takes on a sexual focus
