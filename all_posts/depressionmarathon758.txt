today was the first day of registration for the boston marathon , which is april , registration opened at am i was up at six ! unfortunately , , other people were awake , too , because the system was apparently overloaded for several hours it took me about tries , but at this afternoon , i finally got signed up i'm in ! no missed boston this year ! whew ! what a relief ! now i can forget about boston until sometime this winter when training will begin anew as for my current training , it 's going well i 've got a fairly difficult speed workout tomorrow , x meters , which i'm already thinking about but i love this three day a week training plan i'm doing none of my miles are junk every run is challenging plus , i have four days with which i can swim , bike and or lift weights so far it 's working great ! i think i'm in pretty good shape my race this weekend , i guess , will be my conditioning test i really have no idea what to expect at the same time , i do n't really want to race it all out i have another race the following weekend , and i do n't want to take too much away from my marathon training but who am i kidding ? i 'll probably run my little brains out ! at least i'm predictable you can have everything in life that you want if you will just help enough other people get what they want zig ziglar
