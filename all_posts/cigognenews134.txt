on the breakdown of our adaptive capacity some time ago i wrote about how it is the unrelenting input of pain that taxes our ability to adjust and adapt , causing a breakdown of this capacity the result is a scrambling of our brain cells and a collapse of our ability to cope it can lead to early psychosis or mental insufficiency what does this mean ? for the answer , we must look not only to our clinical experience but also to the latest in brain science in a recent study , entitled epigenetic changes in the developing brain effects on behavior , researchers from rockefeller university in new york and the university of cambridge in england looked at how methylation works to stamp in painful memory and imprint it keverne , pfaff tabansky , when you block methylation you prevent the nerve cells from adapting to changes in their environment it becomes maladaptive new learning cannot take place without successful epigenetic programming and this makes me wonder about the insidious effects of this process when so many orphan children cannot learn well , suffer from dyslexia and are slow to form sentences when there is day in day out neglect , indifference and lack of love , deep damage occurs and the ability to adapt falters the researchers noted that there are adverse effects on the feeling hippocampus areas in short , chronic unrelenting pain overtaxes the native ability to adjust , and we see the results on the feeling level the person claims , it is all too much he gives up easily and cannot try hard to succeed the schizophrenic does not explain it verbally but he lives it he needs help to navigate his daily life he cannot adapt to new circumstances this is the extreme breakdown of adaptation this is because the adaptation mechanisms help us evolve and deal with different circumstances they are crucial for our evolution we can take minor setbacks , such as being left alone for a day or two , but being isolated for long periods damages our ability to adapt if we look for confirmation of all this in hard science , it is there researchers from the dana farber cancer institute in boston discuss cancer in terms of methylation their surprising findings are described in an article entitled disorder in gene control system is a defining characteristic of cancer , posted on the website of the dana farber teaching and research center affiliated with harvard medical school their conclusion the behavior of a cancer cell is dictated not only by genetics by the particular set of mutated genes within it but also by epigenetics , the system for controlling the expression of genes , states catherine wu , m d , a lead author of the study scientists know that cancerous tumors are made up of a variety of genetic mutations within many different subgroups of cells in this study , wu explained , researchers wanted to find out if cancer s inherent genetic diversity was matched by a corresponding epigenetic diversity at first , the scientists expected to find a systematic match between the genetic and epigenetic changes in other words , they thought the genetic diversity in the tumor would be mirrored in the range of methylation patterns instead , researchers were surprised to find methylation patterns with a great deal of random disarray in fact , disorderly methylation pervades the entire tumor , stated alexander meissner of the broad institute who joined the research team the findings , published online in the journal cancer cell , revealed that this disarray in methylation is one of the defining characteristics of cancer landau et al , and counter intuitively , rather than presenting a problem for the disease , researchers theorize that the random disruption of methylation might help tumors survive and even thrive by increasing their ability to adapt to changing circumstances cancer survives through some wildly inventive ways , wu concludes methylation disorder is one of the ways it creates the conditions that enable it to adapt what i am positing is that primal imprints are heavily responsible for this epigenetic tumult and disarray , since the entire adaptation process has broken down under normal conditions , as i have noted , methylation is part of the natural order of things it is a key adaptive mechanism and what i believe is that , in some ways , it gets scrambled and can no longer do its job it has lost its cohesion further , i think the origins of so many catastrophic diseases arise from this disorganization , which is why it is so difficult to treat the boston researchers found , for example , that certain leukemia patients had shorter remissions if their tumor tissue showed signs of highly disorganized methylation , which actually benefits the tumors by rendering them less vulnerable to anti cancer drugs in other words , the random derangement of the methylation process can make the disease harder to treat one final note on this important research the researcher from the broad institute , which is associated with both harvard university and mit , helped develop the technique to measure this deregulation , using a process known as bisulfite sequencing to track the presence or absence of methyl groups at specific rungs on the dna ladder he and his colleagues also devised a simple measure they call , pdr percent discordant reads , to quantify deranged methylation i consider this a major step in epigenetic research , which suggests that soon we may be able to quantify the degree of physical and emotional damage to a human being , and ultimately , the degree of resolution we achieve in a feeling therapy we are rapidly getting the tools to achieve our aims in my opinion , the dangerous time for unceasing pain that threatens the adaptation process is in the womb during gestation here , the chronic smoking , drinking or pill taking of the mother , or her continuous depression or anxiety states , become inescapable from the fetus and he suffers it is ultimately imprinted and endures throughout life it is as if he lived in a straight jacket for nine , agonizing months and could find no way to stop the input he goes to a doctor and the doctor asks , any stress lately ? yes , there is stress , but decades before anyone , including the patient , can even remember it so he shakes his head and says , everything has been ok for some time now those imprints are shouting in the only way they can , through the physical system migraines , asthma , anxiety , depression , and on and on he just cannot get comfortable in his skin , because just below that skin is a mountain of hurt and agitation that won t let him relax why agitation ? because the pain is sending a message to awareness that there is serious trouble down below alas , there is no one to listen and even if they could , they could not translate that message because and this is all important it is not in english it is in a wholly different brain language where words do not exist we have to travel with the patient to the inner depths and see for ourselves and there it is , the agony is right before our eyes the suffocation , the shortness of breath , the misery on the face all finally observable signs that answer the question , what is wrong with me ? epigenetic science can help explain all this methylation is the agent for repression , which in turn prevents the person from putting away the pain and moving on certain switches turn on and off to accommodate the painful intrusion when it gets to a certain level there is a breakdown of its efforts and normal adaptation is no longer possible the result abnormality in physical development and psychological adjustment the person can no longer be neurotically normal there is now serious pathology which endures the imprint literally lasts a lifetime with the person all the while trying to get normal , in and out of mental hospitals , seeing this doctor or that psychiatrist , and all to no avail they will not respond to current treatment efforts because that is not where the damage lies it is locked up with the epigenetic switches that were overwhelmed early on and no longer function properly they almost don t know what to turn on or off they are as helpless as the patient because they are far out of reach of understanding alas , he is condemned but there is a way out if he can travel back in time with us toward the buried vestiges of the imprinted pain and connect with the primal feeling we can commute the sentence because then the epigenetic switches can be reversed and a salubrious state can be achieved what does this mean ? that soon , we will be able to go back down the feeling chain from current to past imprints , observe how deep the pain is by its methyl traces and know where to go for the least dangerous pains first that feeling those painful buried feelings in sequential order from current to remote past so as to finally resettle the methylation process that is , to normalize the biochemistry and allow the genetic switches to normalize so that they can do their job of adaptation disorder in gene control system is a defining characteristic of cancer , study finds dana
