attractive title , right ? anyway , i realized that i 've only really talked about unschooling for a while now , and been really quiet for me , anyway about my political or lack thereof views however , that does n't mean that i have n't been watching , reading , talking , and thinking about said lack of politics views so , i decided to share a bunch of stuff that 's been interesting to me lately i hope this is of interest to at least a few of my readers ! firstly , i absolutely love submedia tv they have a show called it 's the end of the world as we know it every week or couple of weeks , usually around minutes , that just does a wonderful job of putting current events , news , and information on green anarchist anarchist in general , but with a very definite green lean stuff in an amusing , engaging , and informative way you should definitely check it out submedia tv the newest episode next , i also enjoy watching videos by these two guys on youtube , adamhintz and meursaultbateman they both talk about issues of green anarchy , sustainability , and similar things something i'm very against is the olympics in vancouver , british columbia if you look at the sidebar of my blog , you may have noticed that i have a badge against the olympics lots of people react with surprise when i say that what 's wrong with the olympics ? , they ask well , here 's what 's wrong with the olympics why we resist taken from the website no com i 've also been looking into the g summit protests since i got home from camp , and there seems to have been the seemingly fairly normal amount of police brutality here are a couple of videos showing what i mean police state uses violence against protesters intro by howard zinn police attack students at university of pittsburgh also , i may have mentioned a while back that i really wanted to go to the rethinking education conference , especially so i could hear daniel quinn speak well , i did n't end up making it , but his speech was posted online ! thanks to both eli and josh for sending the link to me ! check out part one here oh , and here 's derrick jensen 's newest article from orion magazine side with the living finally , for a long time , i did n't like rap or hip hop music however , relatively recently i 've discovered that there 's some really good stuff out there ! the main thing i never liked was the lyrics the whole gansta hip hop thing , with ho 's and money and guns , never appealed to me radical political hip hop , on the other hand , is totally different ! so here are a couple of my favorites light it up , produced by ratatat , and as far as i can tell , lyrics and obviously sung by zzz you 're a fucking terrorist by resident anti hero you can listen to , and download , all of their music for free at their site annnd that 's all for now ! hope i did n't make this too long ! peace , idzie
