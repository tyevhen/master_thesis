i had my first ect treatment today i got home from d 's house last night , spent the evening re settling into my home , and got up early this morning to get going i arrived at the hospital around am to begin the process my least favorite part of the process is waiting after having our vitals taken , one by one , each patient is sent to a tiny room with about chairs to wait it is a tiny , box shaped room with chairs along each wall which face each other there is just barely enough space to walk between them on your way to a seat there is no music , nothing to distract your attention , and similar to an elevator , i find myself staring at the floor in order to avoid the eyes of the person directly across from me as you can imagine , this teeny room is filled with all sorts of ill characters after all , we would n't be there if we were n't ill ! i prefer to sit in silence and generally bring something to read , which is a little silly , as i can barely concentrate on reading this morning the woman next to me , so close i had to avoid touching her , kept looking over at my reading material that was annoying she was also the token patient , there 's always one , who preferred to talk out loud regardless of whether anyone responded ! that drives me crazy the poor soul across from me was so nervous he kept holding his breath every seconds , he 'd discontinue his apneic period with a long , loud , exhalation he did this over and over again ugh ! if the room was a fraction larger , and if depression did n't make me irritable , perhaps these idiosyncrasies would n't be noticed or annoying unfortunately , that 's not the case we wait in this tiny room for what feels like an eternity one by one we are called out to see a physician 's assistant there is an expectant rush about the room every time the p a opens the door to select the next person on his list my name is never called soon enough this morning , i waited in the tiny room for about minutes , but in the past i 've been there for over an hour after meeting individually with the p a for about minutes , we each get transferred onto a surgical gurney in another room this is the room where our i v 's are started , heart monitoring electrodes are placed , and the blood pressure cuff is applied there are three rolling gurneys in this room once we 're poked and set up , we wait to enter the ect suite again , i tried to read i have no idea how long i waited in this room today , but it felt like minutes finally , i got rolled into the ect suite as soon as the gurney was in place , the ect team was active the waiting was over , as the anesthesiologist almost immediately injected the medicine , and i was asleep within seconds i woke up in the recovery room some time after that more waiting ensued as i sipped on some juice and awaited the arrival of my ride home the whole process , which required a lot of patience , took about hours i spent the rest of the day lying low as usual , i slept for a couple hours after ect i had a bit of a headache , but it never became severe because of the holiday yesterday , i actually will have my second of the three weekly treatments tomorrow i 've never had back to back ect before , so i'm not sure what to expect except for the waiting , of course
