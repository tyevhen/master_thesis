it 's been a few days since i 've written sorry about that d was here for the past three days , and we were having such a nice time together , it was impossible to step away here 's the weekend re cap as i explained in my last post , on wednesday night i had barely enough energy to remain upright apparently i slept well wednesday night because i awoke thursday morning with enough energy to attempt my mile long run , and i had a very good run ! i kept my pace conservative and took frequent re fueling breaks that did the trick i had a nice run on a beautiful day , and i had energy left over to prepare for d 's friday arrival d arrived early friday evening we had a great weekend i ran a mile women 's race saturday morning he cheered me on and got to meet many of my friends and co workers as i was proudly introducing him around , i realized how entrenched i am within the local running community i was surprised at how many people i introduced him to , all of them friends , even though i may only see some of them at running related events i left that race feeling like a part of , rather than apart from , the community in which i live for someone who thinks of herself as a loner , that was surprising to me the race was great fun for several reasons three of my co workers , all of whom have had struggles with weight and are barely beginning runners , decided to join me and run the race the course was two laps around a small lake , so after i finished it was easy to go back and run to the finish with them i was so proud of all three of them i think they each performed better than they imagined they could , and we all had a great time afterward i have some very funny co workers like my co workers , i also performed better than i expected i ran the miles in , hardly my best time , but better than minutes per mile it 's been so long since i 've run a short race , i had no idea what kind of pace i could maintain to dip in under minutes per mile was quite satisfying for this aging runner i think i finished th overall , and i was st in my age group those were just bonuses , though the real fun was having d with me and watching my co workers succeed it was a great start to a lovely weekend the rest of the weekend was just for d and i we spent time playing with jet , sharing nice meals , watching baseball and movies , and running together we enjoyed the local county fair where we mingled with baby animals and ate really unhealthy deep fried food on a stick ! d , the life long city boy , even got to milk a life size , fake cow ! that may have been the highlight of the whole weekend ! it 's always difficult when d goes home , yet it is nice to get back to my routine i'm expecting a good , busy week of work and running ahead i 've got a longer race next weekend to look forward to , and in weeks d and i will be together again to race a half marathon things are going well life is good i'm feeling blessed i do n't know what i did to feel so well , but i'm sure glad i do !
