during world war i , hypnosis was used to treat victims of shell shock this once again brought it to the attention of the scientific community the experimental psychologist clark hull finally established hypnosis as an object worthy of controlled and methodical laboratory studies in hull endorsed bernheim 's view that hypnosis might be the result of suggestion and suggestibility both world war ii and the korean war contributed to renewed interest in hypnosis societies for research and training in clinical and experimental hypnosis were founded hypnosis journals published research findings and case materials specialty boards licensed practitioners and disseminated information to the public the s saw a curious development in the use of hypnosis the spread of hypnotic past life regression which had been practiced since the s , if not earlier , in europe sparked a new controversy in the field adherents of this practice most of whom lack degrees in psychology or medicine believe that events and problems in past lives can generate neurosis and other problems in this life thus , through hypnosis , one can gain access to past identities , relive past traumas , and eliminate their negative effects on one 's present functioning although professional hypnosis organizations have condemned past life regression , it has made its way into ericksonian hypnotherapy , the school based on the work of milton erickson , the pre eminent hypnotist in recent decades some hypnotists have even been able to induce age progression , in which patients conjure up themselves in the future for ostensible therapeutic benefit today , hypnosis appears to be increasing in acceptability in the scientific community erickson 's influence has extended beyond traditional hypnotherapy to family therapy and other clinical areas nonetheless , there remains no cohesive or compelling theory on the nature of hypnosis most agree that hypnotic phenomena are real people are able to dissociate from pain in their bodies , regress to earlier events in their lives , relive traumatic events and forget them moments later , and experience significant alterations in perception but what causes these changes ? is hypnosis an altered state of consciousness ? or does it merely active and channel normal processes , skills , and response preferences ? this is considered the considered the state nonstate controversy , and it leads us to the core problem of the nature of hypnosis the nature of hypnosis hypnotic trance a state in which perceptions are altered either spontaneously or as the result of suggestion and in which there is a detachment from the external world the elements of a hypnotic trance are well known ernest r hilgard , long time experimental psychologist at stanford university and a prominent researcher on hypnotic analgesia , developed a profile of a hypnotized individual with characteristics that he felt was sufficiently consistent to serve as a definition specifically , if instructed , a hypnotized person waits passively for information as to how to behave pays attention only to the hypnotist accepts distortions as reality is highly susceptible to the hypnotist 's suggestions will readily adopt a role of being someone else , and may forget the hypnotic experience let 's assume that these are all aspects of a hypnotic trance is there really something special about this state , something that distinguishes it from everyday consciousness while one is awake or asleep ? various researchers have given conflicting answers to this question see , for example , jonathan venn , hypnosis and the reincarnation hypothesis a critical review and intensive case study , the journal of the american society for psychical research vol , october , pp robert a baker , the effect of suggestion on past lives regression , american journal of clinical hypnosis , volume , number , july , pp peter b bloom , some general comments about ericksonian hypnotherapy , american journal of clinical hypnosis , volume , number , april , pp see heap , michael and dryden , windy , eds , hypnotherapy a handbook philadelphia open university press , see ernest r hilgard , richard atkinson , and rita atkinson , introduction to psychology new york harcourt brace , , fifth edition , p
