in an earlier blog article , i wrote about relationships between mothers and daughters in this blog article and in a series of upcoming articles , i 'll be focusing on fathers , including many psychotherapy clients' desire to improve their relationship with their father more men are coming to therapy now than in years past there was a time when most clients in my psychotherapy private practice in nyc were women things have changed , and men represent about half of the clients in my practice improving your relationship with your father of course , men come in for many different reasons , including problems in their relationship or career many men come in because they want to improve their relationship with their dad for other men , this issue might not have started as the presenting problem , but it will emerge as an underlying problem , often with men who are having problems with self esteem improving your relationship with your father my experience has been that , generally , people tend to come to therapy after a problem has been brewing for a while and their attempts to try to deal with it themselves have n't worked this also applies to men who have problems in their relationship with their father under a variety of circumstances wanting to improve your relationship with your father , but not knowing how even in circumstances where the father son relationship is strained , generally , clients usually say that they would like to improve the relationship , but they do n't know how often , their prior efforts to improve the relationship have n't worked out wanting to improve your relationship with your father , but not knowing how a vignette about a father son relationship it is n't possible to address every permutation of problems between fathers and sons , but i 'll address one particular problem that i often encounter with psychotherapy clients in the following fictionalized vignette , which represents a composite of many different psychotherapy cases with all identifying information changed to protect confidentiality joe joe , who was in his mid s , came to therapy because he was having problems with self esteem he also had a history of having problems with male bosses , which created problems for him in his career when he began therapy , his problems with self esteem created problems for him in his two year relationship with his girlfriend , alice although he knew there was no objective reason for feeling the way he did , he still struggled with his feelings that alice would eventually leave him for another man despite alice 's reassurance that she loved him and she did n't want to be with anyone else , joe could n't shake this feeling he knew his feelings of insecurity were creating tension in his relationship and that they might bring about what he most feared the demise of his relationship with regard to his career as a sales representative , joe was successful and he was well liked by his colleagues and his clients his boss often praised him for his work , but joe had a particular problem with his boss he had problems accepting constructive criticism his initial reaction was to tense up and become defensive later on , joe often realized that his boss had a point , and his comments were meant to help joe , not to hurt him but , try as he might , joe could n't overcome his feelings of insecurity and his initial reaction to become defensive he knew that , in the long run , this would be a problem if he wanted to move ahead in his career joe 's family history was that he was the older of two sons his mom stayed at home to raise joe and his brother and , later on , when joe was in his teens , she worked as a real estate agent joe 's father had his own construction business joe 's mother was the more nurturing parent joe described his father as being a man of few words he was n't outwardly demonstrative with his affection he was more likely to show his affection by spending time with his sons shooting hoops in the backyard or showing them how to fix things around the house joe remembered that , as a child , even though he always wanted to please his father , he felt like he continually disappointed his father his father loved all kinds of sports , but joe had little interest in sports he played hoops in the backyard with his father and brother and joined the little league to please his father joe remembered many afternoons where the family drove home in stony silence after a little league game where joe missed every pitch in the game joe could feel his father 's disappointment , and he felt deeply ashamed it was even more embarrassing for joe because his younger brother was such a good athlete and loved playing all kinds of sports joe 's father and brother bonded over sports , and it was painful to joe because he felt like such a disappointment to his father he wanted desperately to bond with his father the way his brother did , but he did n't know how the situation got worse when joe was in his teens at the time , joe and his brother would often help their father in his construction business whereas his brother really enjoyed learning about the business , joe wanted to be helpful , but he was bored his father assumed that both sons would join him in the business after they graduated college joe did n't know how to tell his father that he had no desire to become part of the family business after joe graduated college , he spoke to his mother about wanting to strike out on his own rather than becoming part of his father 's business his mother was understanding and she encouraged joe to talk to his father about it but joe could n't face seeing his father 's disappointment , so he asked his mother to talk to his father about it after his mother talked to the father , joe 's relationship with his father became even more strained he could see that his father was deeply hurt the business was passed on from joe 's paternal grandfather and joe 's father was disappointed that joe , as his older son , would n't be a part of it joe and his father never talked about it directly by the time joe came to therapy , his relationship with his father was strained and awkward joe dreaded going home to visit his parents he attended the obligatory family holidays , but he would leave soon after dinner he and his father barely spoke or even made eye contact , which was painful for joe and he was sure it was painful for his father too he wanted to be able to talk to his father , but he just did n't know how it was clear to both joe and i that his problems with his girlfriend and the problems he had at work accepting constructive criticism were linked to his history with his father using a combination of clinical hypnosis and somatic experiencing , joe was able to remember a time in his life when he and his father had a better relationship when joe was about four or five memories of that time were very poignant for joe , and being able to access the positive feelings he felt for his father allowed him to write his father a heartfelt letter about how much he loved him and wanted them to have a better father son relationship to his joe 's amazement , his father was very moved by joe 's letter and told him so this began a long process of joe and his father opening up to each and getting closer it was n't easy to overcome years of tension and joe 's father was especially awkward talking about his feelings , but they began the process of repairing their relationship as joe 's relationship with his father improved and he began to realize how much his father loved him , his self esteem improved he felt less insecure in his relationships with his girlfriend and his boss his only regret was that he was n't able to improve his relationship with his father sooner getting help if you 're struggling with your relationship with your father , you could benefit from working with a licensed mental health professional
