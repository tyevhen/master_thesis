i have n't had an alcoholic drink in years why am i giving it up ? i used to drink not a whole lot really but , i liked to get drunk i liked the feeling not knock out drunk , just a little more than tipsy but , it 's hard to maintain just a little more than tipsy when you do n't want that feeling to go away so , i ended up more than just a little more than tipsy more often than i wanted it was n't every day or even every weekend yet , i'm not sure what would have happened to me had i kept up that old lifestyle maybe i would have become an alcoholic , i do n't know it sure seemed like i was on that path alcohol , let 's just say , definitely was n't improving my life when i was hospitalized for depression , the doctors recommended that i give up alcohol i was hesitant at first and only committed to a year years later , i'm still going i do n't feel like a recovering alcoholic because i did n't give it up because i was an alcoholic the main reason why i gave up drinking was because of my depression i do n't know if this is how it works for some alcoholics or not , that there is an underlying condition i never went to aa meetings or anything like that i actually do n't feel like i would be an acceptable candidate for aa i feel like the people there would have been through far worse than me i feel like they 'd laugh me out of the room although , from time to time , it would be nice to have some comradery in not drinking i 've thought long and hard about drinking again since i'm technically cured from my clinical depression , i 've thought about adding alcohol back in my life it 's appealing , i love wine , it feels good and because everyone else is doing it , of course i 'd like to drink as well especially during this time of year , settling down on the couch after a long day with a glass of cabernet sounds so good but , i do n't think i 'll ever do it even though it 's been a while , i still feel susceptible to depression i have good days and bad days i guess everyone experiences these ups and downs however , i always have to be on the lookout for a relapse or , in reality , i never want to have a relapse , so i want to prevent one at all costs would drinking cause a relapse ? i do n't know alcohol does n't cause depression , it just exaggerates the symptoms if you are feeling depressed , alcohol might make you feel better at first , but , after a bit , you will feel more down than before alcohol also impairs your decision making skills so , if you are depressed and having thoughts of hurting yourself , drinking might make you more inclined to act on those feelings or maybe alcohol does cause depression for the alcoholic ? alcoholism is an addiction and addictions control your life if you are being controlled by an addiction , that could cause depression i'm not an expert , this is just me thinking out loud all i know for sure is that things have been better for me since giving up drinking things are n't perfect , but they 're better is not drinking alcohol a contributing factor , i do n't know , maybe but , i 'd rather not find out the hard way
