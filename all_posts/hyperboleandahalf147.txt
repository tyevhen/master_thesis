disclaimer for male readers this post may make you feel weird inside , almost like being molested i apologize in advance for alienating you please do n't go away uterus , f k you where do you get off ? and why is it so hard to insult you without making some sort of sexual innuendo ? every month , you waste my hard earned bodily resources to build a fitting environment for the godda ed baby you are so sure we are going to be having every month , you end up having to clean house and start over because , guess what ? we are not having a f king baby ! ! ! possibly not ever if you keep up your stupid shennanegans ! ! ! you seem to have figured out that i will not allow you to make a baby and are therefore continuing your obnoxious behavior just to spite me let me be very clear , uterus if you keep on making my life a living hell every month when you don t get your way , i will forgo motherhood just to piss you off i will see to it that you do not come into contact with so much as a single drop of semen for the rest of your natural life do you understand ? and being overly dramatic will not solve anything am i supposed to feel sorry for you when you are lying around bleeding like that ? that s my f king blood you are wasting ! have you ever stopped to consider how your childish tantrums affect my life ? you see , uterus , you are attached to my other organs and when you thrash around in anger , they become quite upset your little hissy fits prevent me from doing anything that cannot be accomplished while in the fetal position also , you have somehow convinced my cells that they need to stock up on water for the apocalypse this is not funny i do not enjoy having to cart around the extra pounds of water that my freaked out cells are hoarding away because of your fear mongering it makes me feel gross and unattractive i know that you want a baby i know that it is upsetting for you to go month after month un impregnated but you need to learn how to deal with your feelings in a more constructive manner you see , when you carry on like this , it makes me think that there is something wrong with you that maybe you wouldn t be able to construct a fetus properly you need to earn my trust before i can trust you with the responsibilities of building a baby a major step in the right direction would be for you to grasp the concept of punctuality you are supposed to work on a day schedule i do n't want to spend every month of the rest of my fertile life vacillating between desperately searching for emergency tampons and wondering whether you have indeed achieved your goal of harboring a baby because you are days late for your shift secondly , no more temper tantrums you are supposed to be a nurturing and gentle organ so stop acting like some strung out schizophrenic with a god complex thirdly , be nice to the other organs they are more important than you in fact , i could live without you completely if i so desired , so stop acting so godd mn important you are a floppy pouch of extremely stretchy skin big f king deal get over yourself sincerely , allie
