what a month it 's been when i started out on my resolution challenge journey , november was the month i was looking forward to the most but also secretly frightened of why i hear you ask ? four simple words national novel writing month nanowrimo for short a competition to write a , word novel in just days on the st november i sat at my laptop , opened up a fresh document and set about writing a young adult fantasy story nine days later i hit , words and celebrated with a pepperoni pizza and a bottle of wine ! i threw myself at this challenge with everything i had in me , i blocked out chunks of time in my diary , freed up my weekends and showed the kids how to work the white blob microwave and the silver blob dishwasher i attached one of my favourite quotes from barbara sher , above my desk 'as soon as you start to pursue a dream , your life wakes up and everything has meaning ' that 's what this challenge was like for me and it paid off i'm a nano winner ! i am putting down my speedy win to being an over excited newbie in the land of nano , i'm sure that next year i will relax slightly we can live in hope of course i also realise i just publicly signed up for nano better start thinking about book two then i did n't sit back and leisurely post on numerous forums for the remainder of november however , oh no , i had started something wonderful and i did n't want to stop , so i carried on writing i wrote some short stories , started on book two in my wellbeing workshop series and plotted out my blog posts for the year to come i also began the process of editing my nano novel i then received a very positive rejection letter through the post about one of my short stories , it was a 'not now' rather than a 'no' which told me i was on the right track but my timing was wrong on this occasion how very uplifting i was almost as pleased with this outcome as i had been with my nano win i was being taken seriously as a writer and an editor had taken the time to offer me feedback , pass me another winner badge i'm on a roll ! many nanoers will not have hit the k this year for numerous reasons and my positive rejection letter got me thinking about how i would have felt if i had n't managed it would i have felt like a failure ? would i have hidden myself away from all the masses of people i had told about my challenge ? hell no , i would have said , 'i gave it a go but it was a not now moment , there 's always next year ' if i have learnt anything from the challenges i set myself this year , it 's that 'failure' is a vital part of my growth i'm not going to be afraid of the word 'failure' any more , i choose to call any blip in my life a 'not now' moment everyone faces their own challenges , not necessarily a nano writing challenge , but more likely a weight loss challenge , a career change or ill health each challenge we face will be so much easier if we know , without any doubt in our minds , that those 'not now' moments may stall us , trip us up or affect other parts of our lives , but if we remember to pursue our dreams , our weight loss campaign , or work on improving our health , then life will wake up for us and we will be back on track in no time to prove my point , i would love to share with you my recent interview with the female entrepreneur association which shows how i turned my life around and started my own holistic health business take a look at the full interview here to my fellow nanoers congratulations ! whether you reached k or not , we took part and had a blast , see you all next year !
