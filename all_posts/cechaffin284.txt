because my blog is more popular when i m struggling with grief or depression , as i m told that my descriptions of these experiences are helpful to others if i post poems and speak of literary matters my readership contracts truthfully i don t blog for an audience , or at least i didn t used to now that a fair number of readers have attached themselves to me , i am more likely to try to please them every good artist must be sensitive to his audience while cognizant of the fact that an audience always changes art i finished my umpteenth re write of my book of essays , t s eliot the major poems an undergraduate primer at am last night , a great thing to have accomplished on my birthday i felt satisfied and justified as i went to bed i felt i had done my best to make eliot understandable to this generation even if no academic press takes the book , i am proud of the work here s an excerpt prufrock , in my view , is quite simply one of the greatest poems in the history of the language , as well as the first truly modern poem its appearance cannot be predicted by any antecedents in english literature although eliot was a student of literary history in a number of languages , especially french in which he published four poems in his second collection , the voice , technique and substance of prufrock are undeniably something new an original synthesis of all that had gone before while claiming vast new territories for the future the cardinal difference between prufrock and previous poetry is the fact that prufrock , though a drama , occurs almost entirely inside the head of the narrator what external human interaction the poem contains is comprised of only six lines , words of that my greatest satisfaction was in explicating four quartets , which took up half the book i have never read a lucid explication of eliot s masterwork then my ignorance is vas and i would have wanted to do it myself in any event birthday plans ? kathleen was going to fix me a special dinner but since i ll be playing music with friends around pm , we ll likely skip that maybe she ll bring some dungeness crab home they 're back in season i planned to devote today to getting kathleen s new wireless voice transcriber to work , but the engineer has failed to call me back although he has , inexplicably , been text messaging kathleen while she is driving around trying to do her job of coaching the developmentally disabled in employment situations i have seven books ready for publication three collections of poetry , a novel , a book of short stories about growing up in la , a book with five short stories and a play , and my tome on eliot , a collection of essays and a theological tome as well , but it is only half re written to date i have published but one book , elementary , in , my first collection of poems i need to get cracking on these other properties i need to stop my life and promote my writing instead of taking on new projects so i intend to do in this , my th year and if after a year i meet with no success , i will certainly consider self publishing with publishing on demand convenience i mean , there must be someone who wants to read one of these books ! or ? my rd has been a terrible year , in that i lost my oldest daughter , not to mention being clinically depressed nearly the whole time on the other hand , my youngest , sarah , graduated from high school i 've reconciled with my estranged stepson i constructed a website for my works despite being depressed i was kicked out of a local creative writing class for being too critical i have stopped and started drinking several times and i did get a ton of writing done by sheer will , also because work is the only respite for a mind dominated by depression the book on eliot is the toughest thing i ve ever written , and it took me four years altogether to polish it to my satisfaction i think it s lucid now oh , and there 's this blog another aid in preserving my sanity , and a source of much encouragement i'm glad i continued it in my month depression freud defined mental health as the ability to love and to work life is sweet when you re loved , employed and in good health i even know souls who strive to love me unconditionally how lucky can a man be ? my hope for this year is that i learn how to successfully market my writing self promotion has always been distasteful to me , why i have a backlog of seven finished books i am ready to go on the attack , which means a hell of a lot of envelope and stamp licking and typing e mails into the ether i also want to re decorate the small space we live in so that i feel better about my environment , and follow through on a landscaping plan i have for my garden happy birthday , all ! kilobunnies , craig erick
