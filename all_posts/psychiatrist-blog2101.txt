this is an interesting read in june of last year , i set out to discover scientology , an undertaking that would take nearly nine months a closed faith that has often been hostile to journalistic inquiry , the church initially offered no help on this story most of my research was done without its assistance and involved dozens of interviews with both current and former scientologists , as well as academic researchers who have studied the group ultimately , however , the church decided to cooperate and gave me unprecedented access to its officials , social programs and key religious headquarters what i found was a faith that is at once mainstream and marginal it is an insular society one that exists , to a large degree , as something of a parallel universe to the secular world , with its own nomenclature and ethical code , and , most daunting to those who break its rules , its own rigorously enforced justice system when asked what , if anything , posted by the apostates is true , mike rinder , the fifty year old director of the church of scientology international 's legal and public relations wing , known as the office of special affairs , says bluntly , it 's all bullshit , pretty much the most important , and highly anticipated , of the eight ot levels is ot iii , also known as the wall of fire it is here that scientologists are told the secrets of the universe , and , some believe , the creation story behind the entire religion it is knowledge so dangerous , they are told , any scientologist learning this material before he is ready could die on january th , , hubbard suffered a crippling stroke a week later , he died , in a blue bird motor home on his property he was seventy four years old upon hubbard 's death , his ambitious twenty five year old aide , david miscavige , who would soon succeed him as leader of the church , announced that scientology 's founder had willingly dropped his healthy body and moved on to another dimension in keeping with hubbard 's wishes , his body was cremated within twenty four hours there was no autopsy but the coroner 's report described the father of scientology as in a state of decrepitude unshaven , with long , thinning whitish red hair and unkempt fingernails and toenails in hubbard 's system was the anti anxiety drug hydroxyzine vistaril , which several of his assistants would later attest was only one of many psychiatric and pain medications hubbard ingested over the years discussion , as some academics like kent note , is n't encouraged in scientology , nor in scientology oriented schools it is seen as running counter to the teachings of scientology , which are absolute thus , debate is relegated to those in the world of wogs what scientologists call non scientologists or , as hubbard described them , common , ordinary , run of the mill , garden variety humanoid s
