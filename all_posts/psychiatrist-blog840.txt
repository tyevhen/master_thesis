paul starts with the usual he blames adele for giving him bum advice and says she is responsible for sunil 's deportation ho hum adele is in his face with how stuck his life is hmmm , did n't this guy just get divorced , move to brooklyn , have his kid , leave his kid ? i guess those do n't count paul announces he 's decided on the spot to stop practicing psychotherapy independently wealthy , i presume and yesterday he broke off with his girlfriend and felt nothing and then , in a rare moment of insight , paul tells adele he is stopping therapy , that it is just a repetition of the same patterns and he ca n't continue with this painstaking examination of transferential feelings adele implores him to stay these people seem to feel that therapy is essential to life and that no change is possible without it paul says no , he must go it seems like his first true insight in years and then he announces he is no longer her patient and so it 's fine if she tells him if she ever thought the two of them could be together some things never change ? until next year ?
