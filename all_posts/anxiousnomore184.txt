photo by colodio sorry for the delay in posts but i have been out sick for two days without a computer i have been going through reality of anxiety withdrawals so a very interesting thing has happened to me lately with my business trip and my husband now gone on a business trip and with all the overtime i have been working before the business trips , it feels like a long time since my husband and i have spent any time together and at first i was fine , in fact i love spending time alone to do whatever i want , or better yet , nothing at all however the last few days i have started feeling lonely this is not common for me at all i am finding myself calling friends and family just to talk i actually went over to a friend s house last night to hang out for no reason at all , just because i wanted to get out of my house and interact with someone it s been overwhelming i haven t broken down into tears but have felt close to it at times i just feel so alone and useless luckily ty is coming home tonight and hopefully we can put some normality back in our lives it s been years since i have felt like this i can remember wanting friends and feeling like i was lacking that in my life , but not knowing how to make them loneliness is a horrible feeling , and maybe i have somehow tried to protect myself from it with my social anxiety if i am too scared to interact with others than maybe i am too consumed with fear to feel the loneliness ? maybe i have gotten so used to my support person being there that the loss of that support is hitting me hard ? so i wanna know is there anyone else out there with social anxiety that feels lonely , and why ? it seems like such a contradiction but i am proof it can happen if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety or add it to your technorati favorites you might also like celebrate ! traveling with anxiety trip traveling with anxiety trip what to do when feeling overwhelmed my story linkwithin
