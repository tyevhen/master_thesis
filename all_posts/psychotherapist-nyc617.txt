i returned to italy for a two week visit , after not being here for eight years i spent some time in riccione , italy on the adriatic sea , where i 've never been before right now , i'm in florence , where i spent several days when i was in italy for the first time eight years ago i'm noticing how my experiences are different this time in terms of what i remember from the last time and how i'm experiencing florence now memory , which is so embued with whatever experiences we 're having at that particular point in time , is often unreliable when i returned to see santa croce , one of the major churches in florence , this time , i remembered many of the frescoes that i saw before but there were many other works of art that i do n't remember at all , which were there the last time there 's something wonderful about coming back and re experiencing what i experienced on the first visit there 's also something wonderful about making new discoveries , things that were there all along but that i did n't notice the first time for instance , i went to the duomo museum this time and was very moved to see michelangelo 's pieta , which you can see close up as compared to his pieta in rome i was amused that he used his own face for the face of nicodemus , who is holding up christ , who was just taken down from the cross before i came to florence the first time , people warned me that it can be overwhelming but i have n't experienced it this way there 's always so much more to see than you can see in a limited amount of time , but i'm happy to have seen the beautiful artwork that i 've seen i do n't worry about what i have n't seen because my sense is that i 'll be back at some point life feels very different in florence than it does in new york for one thing , i think that living in a city where there is so much beauty going back centuries gives one a feeling of being more rooted in time and tradition of course , this has it 's positive and negative aspects , as i 've learned from speaking to italians living here in general , traveling is interesting because of what we discover about ourselves in another culture how we respond to differences and similarities , the memories that it evokes in us and the longings that we discover that we , at times , did n't even realize we had until we leave our everyday lives the last time i came , it was in late october the weather was warmer this time , it 's much colder , but the beautiful christmas decorations are up although it 's close to christmas , people do n't appear harried of course , florence is much smaller than new york city with fewer people , so that 's part of it but people also seem to linger in cafes and restaurants to enjoy their food , their wine , and their family and friends many of the restaurants produce their own delicious wines from the hills in tuscany they serve it to their patrons with great pride and hospitality i leave today for a couple of days in rome i 'll be sorry to leave florence , but i definitely want to return to this charming city i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist , who works with individual adults and couples to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at
