you 'll forgive me if i'm out of breath i feel like i just ran the literary equivalent of a marathon since september , i 've written a , word memoir and a second book , a , word mental health how to book and shepherded the output through the neverending , bataan death march like book production process which i 've been writing about at author zone com , and today , finally , the results are live i'm half dead , but the books are live ! isbn order here please , if you have a moment , take a trip over to hackyourdepression com and help yourself to some of the free sample chapters from of two minds , the page memoir in which i talk about my own past problems with bipolar illness and alcohol abuse and my wife 's ongoing nightmare with schizophrenia this is an unusual book , because of how it developed i wanted to capture some of the science behind what we think we know about mental illness , drugs , treatment options , etc , but i also wanted to capture the reality of living with and trying to get help for mental illness so when i began to write , i started with no outline , no plan , no rules , no structure i just free wrote on a topic depression and let the words take me wherever i needed to go if i needed to talk about science , i talked about science if i needed to cite a scientific paper , i inserted a footnote if i needed to tell a personal story , i told a personal story it turns out , for each major topic depression , alcoholism , schizophrenia , suicide , etc my wife and i had deeply relevant personal stories to tell i wove those and the story of our meeting and marrying into the narrative before long , the manuscript was over , words with footnotes and i realized this crazy style of giving scientific background info interwoven with deeply personal , often poignant narratives was actually working this thing was really turning into a book i refused to believe it for the first six weeks it 's the kind of tome that is n't exactly smiled upon by major publishers these days , because mental illness memoirs are seen as a downer and thus to be avoided unless you won a nobel prize or made a major motion picture , or you have a famous father , or your uncle discovered gravy , or whatever i'm none of that , and this is n't a fairy tale of two minds is a gritty , real world memoir that just happens to contain a lot of interesting science you can see the index and toc , plus , words' worth of sample chapters , at hackyourdepression com right now isbn order here as i was writing of two minds , i kept kicking myself for not including more tips for maintaining wellness avoiding depression and anxiety , but the tips i had in mind and there were many just did n't fit into a chapter or an appendix of their own there was too much material , and it finally dawned on me , in a forrest gump moment , that really , the recovery tips constituted a separate book so i gathered my best anti depression anti anxiety tips into a separate work of only , words called hack your depression read about it , and get free sample chapters , right here i 'll talk more about that book some other time i wrote it because antidepressants do n't work for everyone , and therapy beyond a point does n't work for everyone yet there are things you can do to improve your recovery odds , stuff that 's not often written about that 's not to say of two minds is n't packed with practical advice for patients , care givers , and clinicians it is it 's just that the topics covered in hack your depression deserve to live under their own roof , so to speak i 've tried to keep the prices of both books low , rather than play games with pricing e g , set the price high so you can discount it later compared to an hour of therapy , the books are a bargain the , word colossus is and its smaller brother is when i regain my sanity , i 'll probably raise both of those prices , but that wo n't happen any time soon , do n't worry in the meantime please head over to hackyourdepression com to claim your free , unlocked pdf samples of the books and let me know what you think my e mail address is in the introduction to of two minds , which you can download here if you like what you see , join the mailing list no spam privacy assured infrequent e mails easy unsubscribe all gain , no pain before i forget , i want to thank the following crazy great people for retweeting me in the last hours i hope i did n't leave anyone out if so , i 'll get you next time !
