wow , there 's been a whole conversation going on over several blogs about the subject of what exactly the words teaching and learning mean is teaching a good , bad , or neutral word or can a word be good or bad ? how language is used , etc etc it started and i'm doing this in chronological order with cassi 's the role of parental instruction , i responded with some thoughts in my post teaching vs learning , cassi wrote a post entitled teaching and learning , and finally today there 's a post over at lenz on learning called the unschooling thought police be sure to read the comments if you want to get a picture of the whole discussion , because those are at least as important as the original post ! i wanted to post excerpts from some comments i made on a couple of the posts , to kind of expand on why i do n't generally use the word teach don t let words master you is one way of looking at things another way is realizing that words have incredible power they do and what word you choose to use can make a huge difference in how what you re saying is interpreted by those around you jumping on other people because of their word choices ? maybe not such a great idea however , i make a point of paying attention to the language i use , since as both an unschooler and an anarchist , i have very strong opinions about things , and i want the language i use to reflect my values , not just perpetuate all of the stale ideas of this culture so that means that sometimes i decide to use certain words carefully in context , so they mean only what i want them to and it means that sometimes i decide to stop using a word entirely , or almost entirely , if i feel that its commonly held meaning , that i strongly disagree with , is too entrenched in most peoples minds what you describe as teaching sounds a lot like what i 'd just call fascinating conversations with interesting and intelligent people ! i did n't respond before to a mini discussion on whether someone can only learn if they want to learn , but i'm going to throw out a few thoughts on that now i think this depends a lot on what exactly your definition of learning is schools generally consider learning to be synonymous with memorization , and i 'd say you can definitely be taught a list of facts but even then , memorization only occurs if the student decides they 're going to memorize stuff ! students who really do n't give a crap do n't , and fail tests , because they just do n't care so i 'd say that it really is all up to the individual and whether or not they want to learn this specific thing , and if they do n't want to learn , they 're not going to ! as for true , deep , learning , well it seems obvious to me that that type of learning can only ever happen when the student truly wants to learn about whatever it is they 're learning that felt a bit scattered , so my apologies ! not enough sleep lately peace , idzie you might also like teaching vs learning why not leave education to the experts ? learning advice from a learning life unschooling are we teaching ourselves ? linkwithin
