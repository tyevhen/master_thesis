first of all , thanks for everyone who has been commenting on my blog despite my disappearance i plan on getting back to all of your blogs soon , but i 've been concentrating on studying for the onslaught of tests at the end of my emt class i have to do well or else i wo n't pass my national exams i 'll keep you updated on how i'm doing this week was fantastic , though exhausting i celebrated my nephew 's rd birthday twice it only comes around every years , so it 's exciting to celebrate we went to rainforest cafe at the mall of america for our first celebration dinner there was terrible it took about minutes to get our drinks , and they totally forgot to bring my dad 's he had to wait another minutes for his plus , one of us accidentally ate a piece of plastic that was in the quesadillas of course we sent them back and had them taken off the tab , but that 's a huge choking hazard ! the service was terrible , the food lacking in tastiness , and the restaurant had tables crushed together way too close so that you had to bump into another table in order to get out of your own the next time i celebrated my nephew 's birthday , i took him over to a friend 's house , where we discovered horror of horrors that both netflix and hulu had stopped streaming doctor who i'm sure they announced it in advance , but we did n't notice we had to watch a couple of movies instead now i 've bought the th series so that we can watch it at our leisure i also had an ambulance ride along , which was fantastic the trip was hours , and we spent the whole of it in the ambulance there were about calls one every hours none of them were particularly exciting , though we did have to handcuff two of the patients for our own safety i was shocked how quickly hours passed i also went to a high school production of man of la mancha it was fantastic , other then the orchestra which had a fairly bad trumpet player but the acting was superb considering it was a high school performance especially don quixote amazing acting and boy could that kid sing ! currently reading completed this week watched acquired a room of one 's own and chasing the scream were both purchased on sale at audible i'm starting to pile up books in my audible queue through these sales , but how can i resist ? i thought it would be nice to add in one more virginia woolf book this year , as i'm celebrating women classic authors right now chasing the scream fits with my current interest in the state of the failing justice system here in america
