it appears that joe biederman , king of child bipolar , has been caught with his hands in the cookie jar more specifically , the new york times and bloomberg have noted that biederman has received a great deal of pharma cash like at least million dollars from and has not been very forthcoming about such funds how was such undercover money revealed ? courtesy of charles grassley , the iowa republican senator whose prior investigation unearthed a similar situation impacting another bipolar child key opinion leader , melissa delbello from the university of cincinnati here 's one example , from gardiner harris and benedict carey at the new york times in one example , dr biederman reported no income from johnson johnson for in a disclosure report filed with the university when asked to check again , he said he received , but johnson johnson told mr grassley that it paid him , in , mr grassley found so biederman is supposed to report outside income to the university , but he did n't then , his amended reports were in some instances a wild underestimate of his outside income so how well is the honor system working out for conflicts of interest , anyway ? to be fair , biederman is not alone two other harvard psychiatrists timothy wilens and thomas spencer had similar reporting problems indeed , there is nothing to say that biederman 's conflicts of interest are any more noteworthy than those of other stars in the academic psychiatry universe worry not , biederman is still interested in saving lives he is recruiting to year olds with bipolar disorder for a seroquel trial for some reason , i thought biederman 's prior comments were worth repeating here from the boston globe biederman dismisses most critics , saying that they cannot match his scientific credentials as co author of scientific papers a year and director of a major research program at the psychiatry department that is top ranked in the us news world report ratings the critics 'are not on the same level we are not debating as to whether a critic likes brownies and i like hot dogs in medicine and science , not all opinions are created equal , ' said biederman , a native of czechoslovakia who came to mass general in after medical training in argentina and israel he now lives in brookline you tell 'em , joe ! i suppose those who dare critique his conflicts of interest are not on the same level as him some say that we should n't be concerned about conflicts of interest , that we should just look at the quality of a person 's work , regardless of financial conflicts well , biederman is the undisputed king of bipolar in kids , and i'm still awaiting any impressive outcome dataon the bipolar kids being treated with antipsychotics especially the young kids year olds on seroquel i'm glad i'm not on joe 's level are we better off now that the diagnosis of bipolar has run rampant in kids ? also see and furious seasons and pharmalot update also read the carlat psychiatry blog post on the topic
