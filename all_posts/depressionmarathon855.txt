i'm very interested that 's what the interviewer said to the interviewee , me , yesterday she 's also in desperate need of two physical therapists , so she said she 'd get back to me on monday i do n't want to count my chickens before they hatch , but i'm expecting an offer i'm in the process of researching the company website , again , so i can better understand their benefits package it seems like a very solid company , and i really liked the woman who interviewed me she was direct , honest , and realistic that worked for me i'm looking forward to hearing from her on monday as always , i 'll let you know ! everything else is going well triathlon training has been intense but doable i'm definitely in the best shape i 've been in for years maybe ever ! if i was cockier , i 'd post a picture of all my new muscles , but alas that 's a bit too forward for me my coworkers and friends have noticed and commented on my changing body i have n't lost any weight , but it seems to be distributed differently differently enough for people to notice anyway my youngest brother just called it 's rare that we speak to each other my family is not very close so it 's always nice when he calls ironically , he asked if i wanted to do a triathlon with him and my other younger brother he had no idea i was training for my own triathlon ! the brother on the phone was a champion high school swimmer while my other brother was an outstanding runner i guess that puts me on the bike , which is not my strongest event , but i'm the only one with the equipment i was pleasantly surprised by the offer and immediately said yes like i said , it 's so rare for us to do anything together , i think this would be a terrific bonding opportunity my life has been full of little surprises lately , has n't it ? that 's okay i like surprises
