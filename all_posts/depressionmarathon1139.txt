i picked up puck this morning around am just like last time , when i entered the clinic i heard only his persistent bark from the back room he cannot tolerate being in a cage fortunately , he seems to have less pain this time around he 's already putting some weight on the leg , whereas last time it took him several days to just touch his foot to the floor the difference must be the fact that there was no meniscus damage in this knee puck seems comfortable , and he 's been very quiet and sleeping most of the day i'm so relieved last time he was in so much pain i did n't want him to go through that again hopefully , things will continue progressing well thanks for your thoughts and prayers !
