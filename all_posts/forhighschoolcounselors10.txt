recently , my husband and i decided to sell our house so for the last three months , i have been immersed in cleaning , staging , searching for a rental oh , did i mention cleaning so much of my time and energy has gone into selling our house , that i have not been able to write on my blog in several weeks by happenstance , i read about another school shooting that occurred a couple of weeks ago what caught my eye about the story besides the unfortunate event itself was the mention of the school counselor knowing about the apparent threat now , i do n't know if the counselor knew about the potential violence and may not have reported the information however , it really got me thinking how often these situations really occur in our schools so , i decided to take a break from the house nightmare and write a brief post about my thoughts regarding the role of the school counselor in instances of school violence here is what was reported regarding the school shooting daily news according to the daily news , a friend of the suspect reported that the student handed out notes to his friends in the beginning of the school year , saying he planned to do something stupid where he gets killed or put in jail at least one of the notes had been handed over to a school counselor , the friend said no school counselor wants a student to walk into his or her office and hand him or her a note which threatens others , but what if they do ? what if other students know about the potential violence and do n't report it ? what if the school counselor reports the situation and the administrators or sros do n't take it seriously ? what if you call the school counselor contacts the parents and they blow him or her off ?
