and so i ran into the woods despite the water streaming from the sky it was bright , and green , and shimmering in the rain only the missing lab and the bouncing cell on my hip were unusual slow at first and then too fast , as i got anxious about being out too far when they called over the second covered bridge , past the cows , through the canopy of wet , green leaves , i ran he 'll be okay he 'll be okay , i repeated , each time i missed his sprite , wet , happiness racing ahead he 'll be okay is he ready for surgery yet , i asked , as i made a brief stop at my car ? instead , another minutes to explore my former home the k loop was the natural next choice it used to be my usual route , just steps out my front door running it again for the first time in two years , it felt exactly the same that slight jefferson hill caused the same frustrating windedness , closely followed by the same thought that such a small hill should n't feel this tough , which was followed by the thought that i always have the same thought every time i run up this tiny hill ! and so i ran around the corner , i approached my former backyard and began my usual examination of what had changed i still could n't understand why they built that big shed right in the middle of the yard the home above came into view it was still yellow , but the white shutters were a nice addition looked like somebody was living upstairs , too they must have finished remodeling it i wondered what it looked like inside and so i ran the predicatable stiff wind hit my face , as i headed past the house and down the hill i was flooded with memories and emotions my former home triggered i loved that house i loved this little town the number of memories was so intense i wondered if i had made a stupid decision running this route just one hour before my dog underwent major surgery i reached the bottom of the hill and turned left the memory ticker tape whirred and so i ran , spending a moment with each memory as it ticked into consciousness the anxiety of the buying process , bidding on a home we desperately wanted but were n't sure we could afford , settled in my stomach the elation of winning the bid , and the moment walking through the door it was our first home buzzed in my head i recalled the pride of possessing a home only owned once before the original owners , both deceased , built and lived in that home for years , and their pride revealed itself in every door knob , window , and floor board behind the school i ran , ticking through moments , happy and sad , bitter and sweet , as the rain continued clearing my path first home together became first home alone when my spouse walked out the door i was suddenly as aware of that pain , disappointment , and confusion as i was the puddles beneath my feet joy , heartache and gratitude flushed quickly into my gut when i recalled our beloved german shepard , her slow decline , and the final moments of her life we were able to lovingly and comfortably end her life in our backyard because our small town vet willingly came to the house i ran past the post office difficult memories , pain , and regret swooped in the resentment caused by depression which stole my spouse , my job , my finances , and my joy at home stung my soul loneliness and pain knifed through me when i flashed back to drinking alone i was sad and pathetic sitting with my bottles in the living room i had once so proudly created suicide and then , in an instant , warmth and respect replaced the stinging the raindrops became warm tears of grace , gratitude and dignity that home and this community carried me when i could not carry myself , when i could not care less and so i ran , over the covered bridge and back into the park my heart swelled , as i splashed and remembered the local police who became familiar with my illness , yet never regarded me with shame or disrespect my neighbor , a mayo md no less , he anonymously remodeled my front entryway after the ambulance crew smashed through the old , oak , triple locked door and splintered the door jam if i had n't been told weeks later , his act would have remained selflessly unknown the pharmacist , and i smiled when i thought of him , today reminds me that homes are for sale in town and wonders when i plan to move back i missed that sense of belonging despite myself , i was part of this community the warmth of belonging enveloped me , and i smiled shyly as i slowed to a walk and so i stopped running i arrived at my car and looked at my watch it was time anxiety stirred in the pit of my stomach just a bit but it was okay i trusted it was going to be okay i was eerily , strangely , warmly calm the past years of life had just ticked by i spent moments with feelings i did n't like i had memories i regretted i had loss , after loss , after loss tumble past yet , here i was , trusting everything was going to be alright here i was , soaking wet but feeling warm , embraced , and peaceful it was as if the rain had flushed me from the inside out i was splattered with mud , but inside i was cleaned i was clean he was going to be okay i was going to be okay i could love this town again everything was going to be alright thanks , god i needed that
