hi friends ! i'm sorry i 've been away ! time goes so quickly and i do n't realize how much time has passed since the last post i 'll expand on this in my next post , but i 've eliminated the television from our daily routine as of this past tuesday a challenging task for an addict like myself just finished the second full day of no tv with paige and it 's going fine what i do want to mention now is that it is already making me notice all the beautiful little moments we have together and all the simple things that make me smile i thought i 'd comment on them from time to time so that i have a record of them treasured moment today after paige went to bed , i was in my closet and noticed chris' laundry basket sitting there filled with freshly laundered whites socks and undershirts i saw paige 's little bikini bathing suit bottoms bright pink and orange plaid , sitting on top of the clothes she had helped me do the laundry by putting her clean suit where she thought it belonged i paused and smiled as i thought of her helpful spirit wanting to contribute it 's little surprises like that during the day that make me smile a book in an unexpected place a random toy under the bed evidence that a little one was there lucky lucky lucky we are lucky i remember it and treasure it treasured moment today i was feeding paige her lunch and she only had a few bites of this and that before her head suddenly just slumped to the side with her eyes shut i panicked and thought she choked or passed out i poked her and she looked at me and smiled , babbling feverishly her eyes then sort of blinked slowly and she shut them again she fell asleep right there ! she 's never done that before and she 'd shown no signs of being tired before that i decided lunch was over for that moment , brought her up for an early ish nap and instantly and deeply fell asleep in her bed once i settled her in i guess she was tired , but she 's just never instantly sort of passed out like that before it 's like someone did the vulcan pinch thingie she went on to have a typical hour nap and woke in a happy mood i can laugh now , but sheesh ! save you might also like treasured moment treasured moments treasured moments linkwithin
