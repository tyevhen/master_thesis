most of the teens under who i know not including unschoolers , have a curfew , a time by which they must be home or face groundings , loss of computer time , or similar punishments it 's something i 've spent a bit of time thinking about during the school year , though i do n't really agree , i do understand why parents impose a curfew kids do need to be up early the next morning to go to school now , this often does n't affect how late teens go to bed anyway , since they just stay up late at home , but i do see why the parents want them in earlier but in summer ? now that , i understand less the only reason , when getting up early for school is n't an issue , that i can possibly see making sense for imposing a curfew in the summer , is worries about the safety of their kid but there are such better ways of handling it than a curfew , and groundings in some of a teens only free time in the entire year , when they miss that curfew ! here 's how my family handles things we like to know where a family member is when they are n't here we like to know how late someone will be back when emi heads out , for instance i 'll use my sister as an example , since she 's the one who 's out late most often ! , one of us will ask when do you plan on being home ? she 'll give an answer , and our policy is that whatever time is given , you should be home by , or call by , that time that is the easiest possible way whoever is at home does n't worry , and whoever is out is n't resentful because they have to be home by an externally imposed time and in case you were wondering , we 're all pretty good about calling to let hq know where we are and how we 're doing i also ask my mother and father that question when they go out at night , and i expect to get a call if they 're going to be late ! this is n't just something for the younger people in our house if a ride is needed , obviously the driver has a big say in how late the person can be out ! mum is a night owl , and she really does n't mind doing late night driving most of the time i think the latest emi and i have called to be picked up at was two in the morning maybe a bit later she 'd known and ok 'd the fact we 'd be home very late , and cheerfully arrived to bring us home ! , but when she does decide she 's too tired , or really does n't feel like it , neither emi or i are upset or put out it 's also a bonus that at this point , an increasingly large number of friends can drive , and some even have regular access to a car ! so much anger and resentment , so much fighting in so many families , over something that really should n't be a big issue at all every time i hear of a kid getting grounded for days for missing their curfew by minutes , i just shake my head there 's enough things to expend your anger and energy on in this world pick the things that are actually important ! peace , idzie you might also like teenage rebellion an unschooling , respectfully parented unschooling and trust in the adolescent years teenage teens , control , and the nature of love growing up unschooled with siblings linkwithin
