so , as i think i mentioned ages ago , we 're going to the northeast unschooling conference near boston , and leaving in two days ! ! i'm a mix of excited and nervous , which i will explain below i'm excited because i'm going to be meeting seeing a ton of cool people , some completely new , some that i know online and will be meeting in real life for the first time , and some whom i 've met previously , and am happy to see again ! i'm also excited because eli has kindly asked me to speak alongside him in his discussion entitled finding your own path , where eli and i will talk about finding meaningful work ! also , there are tons of cool presentations and funshops now , why i'm nervous is because i 'll be meeting a ton a new people , and i'm shy i usually refer to myself as a social introvert , because i love being around people and am happy being around them nearly constantly , but large new groups , new situations , and new people make me feel shy and kind of like finding a nice little corner to hide in ! even in the case of all the people i already know online , i find it slightly scary to actually be meeting them when people meet me without ever having read my blog or talked to me online , i'm usually quickly forgotten about because , as i mentioned above , i'm shy and tend to fade into the background in new groups however , when people do know me online , they 're expecting something of me in real life , so i ca n't get by by simply fading into the background , i actually have to be myself to a certain extant , to put myself out there more ! which is probably a good thing , but does n't change the fact i'm nervous annnyway , the excitement does still outweigh the nervousness , which is a good thing , and i'm really excited to be going ! peace , idzie you might also like overview of the northeast unschooling conference ! day one of neu conference it 's official we 're going to the northeast unschooling conference ! unschooling gatherings linkwithin
