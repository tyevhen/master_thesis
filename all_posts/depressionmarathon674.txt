i ran this morning ! it 's only the fourth time i 've run since the boston marathon , and i could still feel boston in my legs on those pesky downhills ! i wanted to go miles , as i need to begin training for grandma 's marathon in june , and i made it miles at a nice , quick pace it was one of those feel good runs the weather was perfect , and i felt great it was sure nice to be back out on the road i ran a hilly route i guess i learned my lesson in boston i need to train more on the hills grandma 's is a bit hilly like many marathons , there is a long , heartbreak hill right around mile i 've had to walk at least part of that hill the past couple of times i 've run grandma 's this year i 'd like to conquer it in stride i 'd like to have conquered this depression episode in stride as well , but it 's still hanging onto me i will have three more ect treatments this week to try to shake it loose i do feel better today yesterday was a long one , even though i began my day with my aa meeting , which was really nice apparently that meeting wore me out , because i slept for several hours once i returned obviously , i 've got more energy today maybe depression 's grip is loosening just a bit
