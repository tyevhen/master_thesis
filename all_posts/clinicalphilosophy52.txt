what makes for the unconsciousness of an intention , desire , affect , phantasy ? let 's leave epistemic failure of 'introspective access' or of 'self consciousness' etc etc accounts aside the point here is to provide an understanding that does n't trade in such conceptual and phenomenological futilities we might think it 's to do with a dissociation of action and self ascription , such that if a desire is unconscious someone 's behaviour will still express it in some way , but they will no longer have an ability to express it by self ascribing it finkelstein this view is important and helpful yet problematic for reasons i leave others to articulate leite , in press what i can instead get into here is my own elaboration of unconscious intentionality as loss of self possession i'm suffering a repetition compulsion i'm driven by my desires i'm acting , perhaps even when i am aware of various facts about my psychology , in such a way that still unbeknownst to me i'm even now driven by these very facts by 'am aware of' here i mean 'have true beliefs concerning' what is that ? what is it to be driven by one 's psychology , to lose self possession , to lose sovereignty even when no one other , perhaps , than oneself has set out to depose us ? we might say to someone 'are you trying right now to express envy show me anger demean yourself depress yourself etc ? ' notice that we might also say 'are you aware that right now you are expressing envy etc etc ? ' if they answer 'no' , or 'oh my god you 're right' , then assuming that this is indeed what they were doing they had indeed become non self possessed , become governed by unconscious desire intention emotion the temptation is to suppose that there is something which self possession consists in and then to suppose that lacking self possession is lacking this to turn it around , and resist the temptation , i want to say we do better to think that what is required for us are criteria not for the consciousness but for the unconsciousness , for the lost self possession , of a mental state recall wittgenstein 's try it out comment philosophical investigations on the absence of surprise as a marker of voluntary action so too with consciousness it 's the absence of the markers of unconsciousness which , i'm suggesting , make for the consciousness of an intention or desire an action or expression is unconsciously driven , i suggest , if someone is driven not by herself but by her desire , where the marker of this is that there is here room for what we call being brought to or arriving at a recognition of being thus driven someone who is non unconsciously desirous cannot be said to be brought to , or to arrive at , a recognition of her desirousness she can self ascribe it without any such bringing , arriving , realising you ca n't arrive where you already are unless you first go away the consciousness of an intention is the ontological default and has no markers other than the absence of the markers of unconsciousness unconsciousness wears the conceptual trousers austin hmm , is that a sexist metaphor ? freud got it the wrong way round he thought that all mental states were in and of themselves essentially unconscious , but that we are able to become aware of some of them we do better to almost reverse this there is a default presumption of the consciousness of mental states , but sometimes we can defeat this presumption i say 'almost' this is because i'm talking ontology , whereas he was supposedly talking psychological theory so , consciousness here is to be analysed as non un consciousness i once thought that what matters for consciousness was an absence of disavowal but this is not right someone may , on their attention being drawn to it , immediately be prepared to own their shit 'oh my god you 're right' there need be no moment of disavowal even in the person who has an unconscious desire or intention do we really want to leave it the fact or not of someone having an unconscious desire all hanging in this way on what someone may or may not say of herself ? is n't it the unconscious drivenness not itself rather more visible in the behaviour expressing the unconscious intention than this suggests ? well , the defendedness is often visible in the behaviour perhaps i 've been too dismissive of consciousness ? perhaps there is after all a kind of parity between consciousness and unconsciousness ? for might not a mark of the consciousness of a feeling or wish or intention be that it can enter into rational decision making ? geoffrey loves his wife , but let 's face it he also appears rather drawn to his secretary marjorie the way he only seems to come in to work on the days she 's there , the way he once called his wife marjorie , etc but geoffrey really is n't aware of his desire for marjorie if you ask him he wo n't say 'yes of course' , although sure he might or might not quite quickly say 'oh my god you 're right' if his desire was conscious then he could take steps to rein it in , or he 'd leave his wife , or what have you his desire can now function as a reason for and not simply as a cause of his action well , sure , that 's important but it does n't get to the significance of why it 's important to give the ontological priority to conscious intention the key claim is it 's not as if our intentions or desires are mental states to be understood as only contingently entering into rational deliberation , in which case we call them 'conscious' , otherwise we call them 'unconscious' why not ? if we take an epistemic account of the sort brusquely dismissed in the second paragraph of the conscious unconscious difference , it 's easy to take that kind of a line the desire is there , one might say , whether we 're aware of it or not or it is there whether or not it functions as a reason for action what 's wrong with the epistemic account is not simply the idea of access , but the idea of the independence of the object which talk of access inspires namely , the idea that desires are stand alone phenomena such as may or may not be accessed by us but what it means for a desire to figure or not as a reason for our action is not for us to possess an object which we may or may not be aware of and which , because of this awareness , may go on to function as a reason for action no , what it is for us to have an unconscious desire is for us to not be able to use it as a reason for action to have an unconscious desire , to 'not be aware that we have' this desire , is to be in such a position as makes meaningful talk of being brought from a state of not being able to use it as a reason for action in which case we are no longer in the driving seat , but are instead being driven by our psychology to a state in which we are able to use it as a reason for action the 'because' in the second sentence of the last paragraph was spurious and whilst not spurious , the 'it 's in the final sentence of the last paragraph may certainly be misleading misleading , that is , if we have n't already completely exorcised the misleading picture for the 'it' might once again make it look as if we had here a selfsame item which may or may not get picked up here , however , the item and the picking up are of a piece but before we now get carried away with that and start talking about , say , 'self constitution' , or pondering escher hands drawing themselves into being , let 's instead reject the whole metaphor let 's reject the whole 'it' for otherwise we may be tempted also by the 'because' otherwise we may be tempted to think that the being of the intention or wish or desire is identical in conscious and unconscious cases otherwise we may forget that the 'cannot' in 'we cannot make use of unconscious desires as reasons for actions' is a grammatical 'cannot' grammatical 'cannot 's' do not make for explanatory 'because 's' we may start to think , that is , that the reason we cannot make use of them is because they are unconscious once again we 've slipped back into the spurious freudian metapsychology we forget that our not being able to make use of them is their unconsciousness so often in philosophy it 's such a tiny , subtle , slight difference that goes on to make all the difference well , nozick has a concept of a 'philosophical explanation' , and if we allow his use of 'explanation' then we may also sanction the idea that grammatical 'cannot 's' can make for explanatory 'because 's' nozick 's concept of a 'philosophical explanation' is of an explanation as to how it is that something which we might have thought impossible is actually possible the explanation involves showing us what faulty suppositions we 'd made about the nature of the thing in question the possibility of distinguishing between explanations of this sort , and explanations of how something works , ought i believe to be obvious speaking for myself i 'd rather not follow nozick , and instead distinguish between unmuddling and explanation but , of course , one can say whatever one wants and it does n't change the facts the relevant fact here being that what an intention is when we have an unconscious intention is not the same as what an intention is when we have a conscious intention we do not need there is not even room for an explanation of how an intention becomes available to reason we need an explanation of how it might become unavailable operation of defences an intention can only be said to become available to reason if we have to do with de repression if it had never been lost from reason in the first place , there is no such thing as its becoming available to it we are own it richard i am constantly drawn to thinking of unconsciousness in terms of absence well , in a way it is it is , one might say , the absence of self possession the person who unconsciously intends is someone who does n't know under all the relevant descriptions what she is doing but this is a rather spurious conceptual turn , since someone is self possessed simply to the extent that she is not possessed by her unconscious intentions self possession is not self control , except to the extent that we can be said to 'have self control' just when we are not being controlled no , we might do better to say that unconsciousness here is a matter of presence , and consciousness a matter of absence where what is present is the possibility of being brought to or arriving at recognition of the fact that one intends something or other the possibility of one 's actions being guided by reasons which reasons include the intention in question it is so tempting to think well yes , richard , but there 's a reason why that possibility of being brought to a recognition of one 's intentions obtains namely that someone has an unconscious intention and the defences against it are challenged or vitiated ! and so there 's still a further question as to what the markers are of that unconscious intention ! this is the temptation that is so hard to resist and when we fail to resist it we end up concocting a philosophical theory of the unconscious , rather than simply sitting with and offering acknowledgement to the essential manifestations of unconscious intentionality sure , there truly is a psychological story we properly tell about why the intention is unconscious the story invokes this or that defence , this or that bit of phantasy or history etc but philosophically speaking our spade is turned sooner than we care to admit paragraph of the philosophical investigations has it that in the use of words one might distinguish surface grammar from depth grammar what immediately impresses itself upon us about the use of a word is the way it is used in the construction of the sentence , the part of its use one might say that can be taken in by ear and now compare the depth grammar , say of the word to mean , with what its surface grammar would lead us to suspect no wonder we find it difficult to know our way about that just about sums up the situation with unconscious versus conscious intentions it looks from the 'surface grammar' as if unconscious intentions ought to be conscious intentions with something lacking or that conscious intentions are unconscious intentions with something added this conception of intention merely adventitiously tacks reason onto the animal soul from the outside freud liked to do that it pricked the self image of man as rational animal in a satisfying way ! we can put it like this in the normative paradigmatic , defining case , intending something includes using what is intended as a guide to action a defeating condition for intention i e such that we would no longer speak of someone intending something is if she denies that she has the intention , or disavows it as a reason for her action however there are defeating conditions for these defeating conditions and this , finally , is where the unconscious comes into the picture it is the positive presence of these defeaters of the defeaters which makes conceptual space for unconsciousness as finkelstein notes although he provides different reasons for it infants and animals cannot have unconscious or conscious mental states i e there is yet , here , no room for that distinction in some ways , then , freud 's copernican revolution perhaps was n't quite as dramatic as envisaged ! yet at the same time freud 's concept of the unconscious was rather more distinctive and unique than he imagined the unconscious no merely inwardly unobserved yet self same mentality no , rather a different form of intentionality altogether
