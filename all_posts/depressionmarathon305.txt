i had another disappointing day running today if the race had only been miles , it would have been a great day unfortunately , marathons are miles long , and it was those last miles that really got me i felt really good through the half marathon mark i was running strong , averaging minutes , seconds per mile then , out of the blue , the wheels started coming off and they came off quickly by miles , i was walking i could not have been more frustrated the rest of the race was tough i seriously considered dropping out , as i had planned , around miles , but my brother was here cheering for me , which was great , so i kept going the weather may have had something to do with my quick drop off the temperatures were in the mid to high 's , and there was not a cloud in the sky i stripped out of my shirt , running in only my shorts and a sports bra , but it still got pretty warm out there i ended up finishing in so that 's two hour marathons in a row i'm now a little worried about grandmas coming up in june marathoning is a lot more fun when i feel relatively good throughout , or even if i feel good until later in the race , but these early descents into fatigue make for really long , not so joyful days i 'd like to get back to having a little more fun , and of course , i 'd love to re qualify for boston in the process the only difference between the last two marathons and grandmas last year , when i ran a personal best , is weight training i consistently weight trained last winter and spring but this year , after my depression relapse , and my return to running in january , i 've spent most of my time on the road and little time in the weight room over the past few weeks , i 've started to remedy that , but i obviously need to do more i do n't think i 'll be able to fix the problem in the next month , but hopefully by the chicago marathon in october , i 'll have stronger , more resilient legs that 's the plan it 's always nice to run this marathon , as i hear my name cheered from the sidelines and run with familiar faces throughout in that respect , this year was no exception and as i stated , it was great to have my younger brother here cheering he was a great support and an active spectator i think he saw me or times that was really nice i'm glad i'm coming out of this race with an action plan i function much better with a plan and it helps me be more okay with today it was hot my legs are n't in their best shape with a little work , and perhaps , hopefully , with a cooler day , i know i can do better i'm looking forward to the opportunity
