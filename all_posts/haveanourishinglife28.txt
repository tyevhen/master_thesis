i first started seeing a mental health counselor therapist my senior year of college i 've had all kinds of experiences with all kinds of professionals my last counselor was through a crisis center about two years ago , when i started to wean off my anti depressant medication , i found myself going less and less to counseling it s been more than year now that i haven t seen a mental health therapist , counselor , or psychiatrist it had been my intention to continue to go to counseling even after i was recovered i thought it would help me maintain my state of mental health and prevent any major setbacks by catching them early but i find myself here , one year later , having not been back part of my dilemma is that i don t feel like i can go back to place i did before because it was a crisis center , i don t feel like i deserve a spot there there are plenty of people who need the services more than me the center was always busy , and the staff was always overworked i would feel guilty if i went like i was taking up space space someone else needed more than me when i think about it , it s not just that place that i don t feel i can go i don t feel like i can go anywhere i continue to struggle with depression and anxiety , yet i know i m not as bad as i once was i m not nearly as bad as some people who need counseling more than me i hate feeling like i don t belong somewhere or i am wasting someone s time even if i am paying them for their services , i am keenly aware of when i am burdening someone counselors and therapists are human too how can they handle listening to people s problems day after day and not get worn out or develop a mental illness themselves ? just some of the thoughts that go through my head even though i think i need regular counseling , i talk myself out of it i don t feel like i deserve counseling the fact that i said i don t feel i deserve should raise some red flags part of the reason why i ended up in a mental hospital was because i had such a poor self worth and did n't take care of myself symptoms of my depression i need to remind myself that i am deserving , i am worthy , and i should not feel guilty for trying to take care of myself if anyone tries to make me feel bad for doing what i do , then that is their problem not mine easier said then done
