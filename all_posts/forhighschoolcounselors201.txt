the first time i met casey not his real name was in th grade when he was referred to his school counselor by one of his good friends for making statements about hurting himself casey 's counselor was not at school that day therefore , he was brought to me when he walked in my office , it was like a heavy cloud descended into my room physically , the student was a mess he was hunched over , his brow was furrowed with heavy creases , and he had a blank look on his face after delivering my normal informed consent , he immediately let me know that he hated his life and had often thought how much happier everyone would be without him clearly , this student was depressed and had suicidal ideations after giving casey a suicidal risk assessment , his parents were contacted and asked to pick him up from school to take him for an evaluation when the parents arrived , they admitted that they were not shocked by his behavior and were use to his threats apparently , casey had been depressed since he was young boy and had been seeing a physician on and off for his moodiness the parents told me that they felt he would eventually outgrow his malaise so they decided to take him out of counseling at that point , the social worker and i both insisted that the student continue mental health services and we would check up on him in a few days now , fast forward to his junior year that year , i noticed that casey came to see his school counselor regularly about his emotional outbursts in class unfortunately , the sad little freshman had now become a very ill tempered young man his jaw was always clenched , he never smiled , and if you asked him how he was doing he would often give a negative response sigh alas , there was a glimmer of hope for casey during his junior year , he started dating one of the sweetest and most positive young ladies that i knew at the time in fact , the two dated for almost a year until she was worn down by his chronic bad moods and unhappiness one day , after having taken all she could bear , she decided to break up with him in his quest to win her back , he made many promises that he would be a better man and he would treat her like she deserved however , the relationship failed a second time and she broke up with him again unable to cope with this final rejection , casey called her on the phone while the two were arguing on the phone , he decided to kill himself the news of casey 's death spread like wildfire through school and many of casey 's friends were devastated however , the saddest part of the story was that everyone predicted that casey was a young man on the verge of suicide in fact , many students and staff members said he was a ticking time bomb ready to explode truly , this was one of the saddest events that i had ever experienced at a school the story of casey is not that uncommon in our society everyday , there are thousands of young men who are just one moment away from ending their lives due to depression often we think of teen suicide as a female issue , but the reality is that males successfully complete suicide more often than girls if you take a look at the list of males who have died
