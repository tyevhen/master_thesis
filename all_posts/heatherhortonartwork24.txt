self portrait with sasha in progress , oil on canvas , x i love to write but often feel that i need to write about a new painting or some type of epic adventure this does n't need to be the case i need to use this space as more of a journalling opportunity it is rather terrifying and also quite cathartic thus the next few entries might be shorter and i apologize if they are much longer with more to wade through regardless , here goes i have been watching films like no one 's business lately recent films seen include my week with marilyn j edgar the tree of life extremely loud and incredibly close crazy stupid love the artist hugo d the descendants midnight in paris war horse i thought some of these films to be an utter waste of my time and others were sweet and charming some were poignant and a bit pat , but still very good the most overrated films i found to be 'the artist' and 'extremely loud and incredibly close' i could write a whole polemic on each but will save you the time of reading them just please , if you want to see hollywood schlock , watch 'extremely loud and incredibly close' the young actor in it is an incredibly annoying character trust me i thought 'midnight in paris' and 'crazy stupid love ' were excellent they did n't try too hard they were just lovely and hilarious do you know of terrence malick 's films ? good if not , i envy you malick should just do nova specials rather than feature films his cinematography is beautiful but please , no more with the highly paid actors wandering about in barren landscapes trying to appear to be deep , okay ? in other news i have a new addiction spin class i love it now the instructor is crucial to your class enjoyment the strangest and most idiosyncratic instructors are the best i find their quirks compelling and entertaining therefore it is their classes that i return to faithfully it 's a great opportunity for a bang up aerobic workout plus it saves your knees from all of the abuse they withstand on the road or on the treadmill i find spin classes as week combined with a yoga class , weights and running is a perfect routine to give you lots of energy and happiness plus i'm training for a km hike across the western edge of greenland next year with my friend from whitehorse so that helps motivate me as well ! goals are so important if you do n't have one , make acquiring a goal your goal my lungs need travel to breathe travel and adventure are the air that sustains me atop mount white near whitehorse , in the yukon territory last but not least i was thinking about my artistic inspirations today my first inspiration as a college student was the artist tamara de lempicka she lived and painted in my favourite decade , in one of my favourite places paris in the 's can you imagine it ? i can art deco , hemingway , anais nin , henry miller , and on and on lempicka showed me the beauty and potential of female painters frida kahlo 's inspiration came later , but that 's another blog entry i am not as drawn to tamara as much now , but it is important to give a nod to your inspirational roots i have already spoken of andrew wyeth and lucian freud as my other main influences sargent is in there too but i 'll return to them at another time i hope you like the newest painting i am working on , shown above the finished painting will be on display with my upcoming solo exhibition at abbozzo gallery in oakville , ontario this autumn my cat sasha wandered into frame as the tripod and camera did their reference collecting for me i like that sasha is very subtle and almost not discernible until you really look he is five pounds soaking wet , five years old , and one of my best friends and closest confidantes he 's patient and never tells my secrets he loves me unconditionally and is a positive reprobate when i am gone for long periods of time , let alone a couple of hours i adore him for his beauty and his beautiful flaws in fact , here is a painting of him so these are a few ramblings from me to you i hope you are having a beautiful last few days of this february as it ebbs away thank you for reading , following , supporting and believing in my painting and me best , heather p s i must suggest you acquire the official soundtrack to the social network it is amazing if you are a trent reznor fan i am sure you have it already if not get it , please it is perfect to work to , think to , write to , paint to , bathe to , fall asleep to , drive to here is a link to information about it p p s david fincher is a genius
