chapter of the su wen introduces the concept of channels opening onto the exterior or being the opening , closing onto the interior or being the door leaf and being the pivot or hinge in this chapter the order for the yang channels is as follows tai yang opens yang ming closes shao yang is the pivot the order for the yin channels is tai yin opens jue yin closes shao yin is the pivot with regard to the yin channels i personally see the jue yin as the pivot i call it hinge and the shao yin as opening onto the interior or closing there are various reasons for this firstly , if we read chapter of the su wen in full and we look at the context of the exterior interior hinge quote , we will see that things are not quite as they seem it sounds like this chapter is talking more about zangfu organs than channels and more about the trunk and abdomen than arm or leg channels secondly , the very same chapter also says the vessel behind tai yin is shao yin the vessel in front of shao yin is jue yin therefore , tai yin is in front of shao yin and jue yin is in front of shao yin this means that jue yin is in the middle between tai yin the front and shao yin the back that sounds very much like the jue yin is in between the tai yin and the shao yin , i e it is the hinge moreover , when it talks about the yang , chapter says the vessel outside the jue yin is the shao yang as the shao yang is the hinge of the yang , it being outside the jue yin would imply that the jue yin must be a hinge too of course the shao yang triple burner and gall bladder have a yin yang connection with the jue yin pericardium and liver and that is why this chapter says that the shao yang is outside the jue yin thirdly , the book great treatise of chinese acupuncture zhong guo zhen jiu da quan by wang xue tai uses similar terminology when it refers to front , middle and back of channels , which i would translate as lateral , middle and medial this book confirms that the jue yin is in the middle this is reflected all over the body in the situation of the channels with the exception of the lower leg for example , if we look at the chest , we have the spleen channel tai yin outside lateral , the kidney channel shao yin inside medial and the liver channel jue yin in between the same in the abdomen this is even clearer in the arm where we have the lung channel tai yin on the lateral side , the pericardium channel jue yin in the middle and the heart channel shao yin on the medial side only the lower leg represents an exception as the liver channel jue yin is on the lateral side initially but it crosses over in the middle of the lower leg the order of arrangement of the stages in the shang han lun also points to the jue yin being the hinge in fact , this is the order tai yang yang ming shao yang tai yin shao yin jue yin thus , if shao yang is the hinge of the yang channels , then the jue yin must also be of the yin channels because it occupies a corresponding place in the yin as that of the yang if we look at the channels during the day lu li st sp , etc we get ext int int ext hinge hinge tai yin yang ming shao yin tai yang jue yin shao yang lu li he si p tb sp st ki bl liv gb if we bear in mind the yin yang connections among channels , the triple burner shao yang is connected to the pericardium jue yin and the gall bladder shao yang to the liver jue yin therefore , if the shao yang is the hinge of the yang as it clearly is , then the jue yin must be the hinge of the yin the diagrams below illustrate this concept the two diagrams below show the position of the channels in arms and legs as indicated above the diagram below shows clearly how , if we related the concept of opening closing hinge to channel topography , the jue yin must be the hinge notice how the heart and kidney channels are both medial , both inside , both the most interior and therefore not pivot or hinge of the yin channels clinical significance what is the clinical significance of all this ? in my opinion , the clinical significance is more relevant for the yang than for the yin channels if we look at the yang channels , it is very obvious why the tai yang opens onto the exterior its channels are lateral , on the outside and cover the very yang area of back of the neck and back not by chance , the first stage of the shan han lun is the tai yang stage and not by chance this stage is marked by occipital stiffness tai yang area that the shao yang is the hinge between tai yang and yang ming is also clear from the shang han lun the shao yang syndrome is characterized by the alternation of feeling cold and feeling hot this is due to the fact that the pathogenic factor is trapped between the tai yang exterior and the yang ming interior when it floats toward the tai yang , the patient feels cold when it goes to the yang ming , the patient feels hot in my view , however , the most important clinical significance of the concept of hinge is in the field of mental emotional problems this is a view according to my experience and not according to chinese texts i see the role of hinge of the shao yang and jue yin as a metaphor of their involvement in relationships , in our relating to others all four of the shao yang and jue yin channels play a role in relating but especially so the jue yin , i e pericardium and liver the liver even more so because it houses the hun which provides the shen with the movement necessary to relate
