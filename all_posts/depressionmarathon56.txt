i'm home from the hospital my back is only slightly better i now have numbness , tingling and weakness in my left leg , which necessitates walking with a cane around the house and crutches for anything of any distance i am now two days away from missing my marathon , and more importantly , days from missing skydiving with my brother , niece and nephew an outing which was my idea and which i arranged i'm so disappointed i do n't even think i 'll be able to go watch them jump i can run more marathons , but missing my niece , nephew and brother 's first skydive is an opportunity i 'll never have again that fact has had me in tears more than once today my last day in the hospital was quite challenging throughout the day it became very clear i was being treated differently based on my mental health diagnoses i had concerns about going home as nothing had been resolved , but i was being treated like i was attention seeking my practical concerns and physical complaints were dismissed i had a nurse practitioner argue with me over my mri results , results she insisted were benign but according to a specialist i had just seen actually were far from benign and as i was leaving , members of my inpatient treatment team flat out refused to write up a referral for outpatient physical therapy no reason they stated i had to get a referral from my primary doctor instead , which is bullshit i get patients everyday from mayo clinic who are referred to me by their inpatient doctors and providers what benefit she got out of refusing to write up a referral i ca n't imagine as far as my mri , i learned there are many ways to interpret an mri depending on which slides you look at , and only the real specialists understand how to properly read them after my mri , the initial radiologist read it as benign then it was read as basically benign with a small disc bulge at l that 's the fifth lumbar vertebra by the physical medicine doctor , but since my numbness , tingling , weakness , and reflex changes all corresponded to an injury at l , that did n't really make any sense nevertheless , he ordered an epidural injection to l i was game for anything that might help but frustrated the images did not match my symptoms , and nobody seemed to care fortunately , when i arrived later in the neuroradiology department for my injection , the neuroradiology consultant correctly read my mri as having a large disc extrusion at the level of l picture a really full zit popping at full force and squirting its contents into the space where the l nerve root exits the spinal canal and a smaller disc protrusion a full zit which has not yet popped at l she showed me the pictures the extrusion and protrusion were clear as day , and more importantly , both findings were fully supported and corroborated by my physical symptoms the fabulous neuroradiologist attempted times to inject corticosteroid medication into my l space , but she could n't get the injections to work , so she attempted an injection at l , which did work my pain lessened an l symptom , but my leg numbness , tingling and weakness which are all correlated with l has , as expected , gotten worse it 's been a rough couple of days my mood has certainly taken a big hit and i'm still fuming at the way i was treated as my inpatient doctors found less and less evidence , at least in their eyes , of anything actually being physically wrong therefore , it must just be the mentally ill chick seeking attention and making things up , right ? last but not least , my discharge summary does n't open with a statement about my excruciating pain , which was the reason i was hospitalized instead it highlights my mental health diagnoses , first and foremost , before eventually mentioning i had acute back pain recurrent depression belongs in my past medical history , for sure , but it had nothing to do with my back pain , and it certainly did not need to be highlighted in the first sentence of my discharge summary the stigma of mental illness follows us everywhere anyone who thinks it does n't impact our care for a variety of conditions is either clueless or blind it 's stigma ! it sucks ! and it really pisses me off !
