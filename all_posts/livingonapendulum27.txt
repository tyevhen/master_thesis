as you know , i am on sick leave till january and have applied for ei well things are not going too well on that front i have been filing my reports , every week and two weeks fastiduously since i stopped working , even for when i knew i would not qualify eventually , work sent my roe to ei weeks later it was determined that i qualified from october th as i was paid sick leave for the th , that was declared on both my roe and my report at first they said since i was getting sick leave for the whole two weeks that i would not qualify i called to have that fixed thought it was fixed she told me that on thursday i would get the payment fot the first week and on friday i would get my payment for the second week by the end of thursday i had not gotten the money , figured it would be paid on friday friday i look at my account and see the second week but not the first so i call they say that i had gotten earnings from working plus sick day so i qualified for nothing i say i did not work or earn , they blame it on my roe call my advisor to send in a corrected roe i contact my advisor , she says the roe is correct she calls her support , spoke to carole and had it confirmed that it was correctly done , i have to call back i call back and i get a third story , seems there was a new data entry error , something was not corrected patty put me on hold to figure out how to correct it they all agree the four people i spoke to , the first day , the second time that i qualify for a little over for that week but none can get it resolved it seems mind you everytime i call i am on hold for minutes why ca n't my life be simple ? i would not need sick leave at all if my life was simple ! thanks for reading you might also like depression , pain and sick leave very sick kitten and other stuff the library another dream linkwithin
