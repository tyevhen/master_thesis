it 's been a while since i said anything things have not been good for me personally or professionally but i'm surviving i have no patience for people whining about their life 's circumstances so i wo n't bore you with mine so , here 's a quote i stumbled upon you can accept or reject the way you are treated by other people but until you heal the wounds of your past , you will continue to bleed you can bandage the bleeding with food , with alcohol , with drugs , with work , with cigarettes , with sex , but eventually , it will all ooze through and stain your life you must find the strength to open the wounds , stick your hands inside , pull out the core of the pain that is holding you in your past , the memories , and make peace with them iyanla vanzant i do n't know if i can do that but it sounds pretty good
