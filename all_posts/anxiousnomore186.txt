for me this is the best thing i did for myself on my business trip to california if renting a car , do rent a gps unit to help you navigate i have a lot of anxiety with driving it took me tries to get my license and it was only due to my parent 's pushing me i was when i finally got it i had no desire to drive sitting in the driver seat nearly gave me panic attacks i eventually got used to it , but had a hard time on the freeways so i would drive if i had to but i would avoid freeways as much as i could now i have to drive an hour to work everyday on the freeway i do n't like driving with people in the car with me , and i do n't like driving when i do n't know how to get there so anytime i have to drive with others , i actually ask someone else to drive my car so i do n't have to deal with the anxiety so for me to go to a busy city like san jose and san fransisco all by myself and drive everywhere , this caused a lot of panic for me it was probably what i was the most worried about when renting the car i added a gps unit for an addition a day does n't matter how much it would have cost , i would do it again in a heartbeat not only did it take away of my anxiety , it gave me a sense of empowerment and confidence i would be hungry and type in the kind of food i was in the mood for and it would tell me exactly how to get to the closest location the best part is if you miss a turn , no need to panic ! it will recalculate your destination and help you get to where you need to go i was able to travel to my hotel , different schools , several fast food places , etc with complete ease even though i had never been there before by far the most exhilarating day on my trip was when i had some time to go to san fransisco to do some sight seeing never before would i have dared to drive an hour away to some unknown place all by myself but with my handy garmin gps unit , i located the golden gate bridge and set off on my adventure i drove around downtown san fransisco on the unbelievable hilly roads with the beautiful scenery i drove over the golden gate bridge twice , ate clam chowder while photographing the bridge , had a wild coyote follow me around , walked along pier and saw alcatraz , ship yards , and so many other great things that i will forever remember as a liberating experience i never would had that experience without the gps unit it was so windy and cold that it made taking pictures difficult plus there was a fire burning in northern california so the sky was covered in smoke , but it was still very cool now back at home i want to buy one for my personal car to help me get around town better maybe i will be more daring to drive around salt lake and see some of the great things my home town has to offer p s for those interested in photography , i still need to edit these photos a bit but i wanted to get the post out this post is part of a series you can read some of my other do 's and do n'ts here part , part if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety or add it to your technorati favorites you might also like finding beauty in the storm do 's and do n'ts when traveling with anxiety part celebrate ! traveling with anxiety trip do 's and do n'ts when traveling with anxiety part linkwithin
