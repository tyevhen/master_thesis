i can hardly believe it has been a year since i started taking dutasteride i reviewed my dutasteride journal this week and summarized my findings by quarter st quarter i was flying high because there was an immediate improvement in strength improvement in leg strength was the most noticeable i felt stronger and had very little pain many of my muscles felt alive again tightness after exercising exercised seven days a week continued to add exercises and weight until my longer program was two hours long no apparent side effects nd quarter stabilized at the new stronger level didn t notice quite the same level of high strength that i experienced in the first quarter for a week in may i had a significant amount of neck pain continued to exercise for minutes every other day and minutes on the off days no apparent side effects rd quarter exercised for minutes every other day and minutes on the off days no apparent change in strength continue to feel i am stronger than i was six months ago no apparent side effects th quarter i felt that i was over training and was no longer enjoying my long exercise program i reduced my long program to minutes and it seemed to help i began to experience neck weakness and cramping , often severe in the th month i noticed a slight weakness in the arms in the th month my right arm was weaker no apparent side effects final thoughts this has been an interesting twelve month ride i believe that dutasteride helped initially and that i ended up being stronger than i would have been without it over the last three months i have experienced neck pain as well as arm and neck weakness that i had not experienced earlier what these means for my future only time will tell conclusion i am glad i tried dutasteride and will continue to take it for the foreseeable future
