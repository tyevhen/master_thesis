i 've made my decision i'm going to do it i'm going to follow through with my plan and swim , bike and run this sunday i know i will be absolutely terrified at the start of the race , but at least it wo n't be a surprise ! i'm relieved to have made a decision , and i feel good about giving this a try the decision was really made for me yesterday i took up a friend 's offer to swim across a local lake with a boat following us the moment i jumped into the deep water , my heart started racing things were not looking good on our first trip out and back approximately yards , i had to stop frequently i was panicky i could barely breathe , etc , etc i took a break on the dock for about ten minutes before i tried again that 's when the miracle happened miraculously , i settled down and swam for long stretches without stopping the first trip out and back took minutes the second one only took ten i was still scared when i had to stop , but i handled it my breathing was more relaxed my heart rate was slower i just swam by the time i got out of the water , i knew i had to give this thing a try i swam again today , across another lake , with some other friends today was a little tougher the lake was much rougher , and the boater was n't nearly as close to me my fear got the best of me a couple times i had to climb out for about ten minutes again , but i got back in i swam for about minutes total i feel a little less sure of my decision today , but i know i 'll feel worse if i sit this out i'm getting there i'm still afraid , but i'm facing the fear i think i 'll be able to get through it , but i'm going to be okay if i do n't i think i know i 'll give it everything i 've got on sunday if fear gets in my way , which i'm sure it will , i 'll just have to do my best to give it the boot wish me luck ! and thanks for all your support
