my passion has always been to help other people so today i am going to deviate and go back over my life way back my mother married at and soon was expecting me maybe not a great treasure for a very young mother i was born a month early and i recall my mother telling me that i was the ugliest baby she had ever seen you could see every vein in your bald head , she told me my maternal grandmother was thrilled at my birth and for some reason my mother turned me over to my grandmother after i was born fortunately my grandmother was an angel however , when i was six months old other relatives kept telling my parents they needed to get their baby back , so they did by the time i was one , i had hair and looking back at my baby pictures i do n't think i was an ugly baby then tiny , but not ugly i do n't recall much about my early childhood , except that my father was a foreman for a coal mine in kingman , arizona it was and hot and dry and i did n't like it even as a toddler treking accross a prickly patch of cactus to a small one room cabin that i shared with my parents and baby brother my mother cooked for the miners in a large tent that housed the mining machinery and smelled like greese to this day , i do n't like pancakes because they bring bake the memory and awful stenchl of those greesy machines i recall droping a toy down the mine shaft one day , and weeks later my father found it dirty and covered with black coal dust we moved to salt lake city and i soon had younger siblings born months to two years a part the frouth child was a gorgeous little blue eyed girl with blond curlys and big dimples my first sister , and i adored her and played with her like she was a doll when she was two , my girl friend and i used to dress her up in lots of layers of clothes to make her look like a fat lady she hated it and when she grew up she never let me forget it somehow she got the tan skin that i wanted and she had no freckles when i started kindergarten , i weighed a little over pounds the smallest girl in my class and still was when i was in sixth grade my face was loaded with freckles and how i hated those freckles as good fortune would have it we moved across the street from an amazing family the johnson family and we became life long friends some people come into out lives and quickly go , others stay awhile and leave footprints on our hears and we are never , ever the same shana , their youngest daughter , was nine months younger than me and we became inseparable freinds a world of holly hock dolls , wet sand sandwiches smashed between two large

intensely patriotic we had rationing coupon books sugar was among the food that was rationed now , i look back upon sugar rationing and think it would be a blessing if we had that today sugar pulls calcium from the bones , contributes to cancer , candida , heart problems , high cholesterol , alcoholism , behavior problems in children and the list goes on and on however , when i was a child i loved sugar , craved sugar and ate tons of sugar now we know that grams of sugar per day is the maximum that children should eat a day and grams per adults as a kid we had fats gas station on one corner with all the penny candy anyone could ever want on the other corner we had zissi 's root beer with cent minature iced mugs of root beer we were either at one corner or the other almost daily it
