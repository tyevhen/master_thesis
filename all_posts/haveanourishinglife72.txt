recently , there have been some difficult things in my life that i can t control so , with intentions to ease the uncertainty , i ve reverted back to my old eating disorder mindset i m unhappy if i lost some weight , i wouldn t be so unhappy because my habits are now with intuitive eating , i haven t acted on these feelings yet but i am tempted to which is frustrating to say the least again , my mind is beginning to be consumed with thoughts of diets , exercise , and smaller clothes i believe that , right now , these eating disorder temptations are acting as a distraction instead of focusing on what s really going on in my life , i am trying to control what i eat because it seems easier , because the real issues are too painful to acknowledge i ve been practicing intuitive eating for some time now when i started this new approach i was underweight i could not admit that fact for months , and i still have a difficult time saying it or writing it out loud nonetheless , since i was underweight and undernourished , part of overcoming my eating disorder meant returning to a healthy , natural weight i never really knew what my healthy , natural weight was because i constantly fluctuated up and down since high school i avoid scales like the plague , but i think i am somewhere around pounds heavier than i was a few years ago for someone with an eating disorder , pounds is a very big deal recognizing this fact , i ve had to come to terms with an important realization concerning my feelings about my weight this is the new me i am not that person i used to be i am not a person with an eating disorder i am not a person that fits into those clothes anymore this is not a phase this is not temporary until i can figure out how to lose weight again this is the new me i am no longer that size i have curvy hips in the non hollywood way , a large cup size that makes bra and shirt shopping irritating , and a some chubb around my middle that makes me cry when i see it in the mirror if i am truly and honestly going to get over this whole eating disorder thing than i have to accept the new me as i am right now more than that , i have to believe that this is the true me truer than i ve ever been in the past this is what i look like now and i have to come to terms with that fact and move on with my life something i 've been putting off is going through my closet i have to get rid of th of my clothes and start over i have to give up those old items that i used to love because they made me look skinny and those things that i took pride in because of the small number on the tag all of my favorite dresses and jeans have to say goodbye the worst part for me , ms frugal , is that i have to spend the money to get a new wardrobe i think my worst fear is that i can no longer look beautiful , or even just good , and put together for that matter stores do not sell clothes for a ft in , pound woman who is trying to be modest i know there will be tears and shame and more tears before all is said and done but i must commit to this mission being thin or losing weight will not make me happy i don t want to go back down that e d path it is all lies and deception i heard something the other day that i find myself repeat over and over in times like this it went something like this i don t remember where it s from outward beauty does not penetrate your soul , but beauty on the inside shines out through your skin if i focus on the big picture , maybe i can get through this trial there are things in life that i want more than a small waist some days i just need more reminders
