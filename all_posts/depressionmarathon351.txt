yesterday , december th , i officially hit years of sober living i have n't found it necessary to take a drink of alcohol since december , that , my friends , is a miracle ! and i am profoundly grateful today despite all the pain this journey has sometimes entailed , i would n't give up my sobriety to change a moment of it i am humbled by the assistance , guidance , and love i have received over these past eight years by my friends in recovery i would not be sober , nor alive , today without the people around me or my recovery program living in the moment , one day at a time , and taking the next right action are all recovery principals which guide me through my days , whether they be good days filled with friends and love or bad days consumed by depression and isolation by using the principals i 've learned in sobriety i 've stayed alive and functional i 'd be dead today had i not gotten sober it 's that simple i pray for those still out there , still suffering , and hope they , too , find a way to a much better life eight years i'm humbled wow
