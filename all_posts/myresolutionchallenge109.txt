life can swerve in a different direction at any point , sometimes you are ready for it but more often than not it flings you unceremoniously from a moving vehicle this is what happened to me , but as i look back i see that it was n't a sudden swerve , more of a winding road that i did n't realise i could get off getting back on track took a huge amount of patience and dedication but with the support of my family i did it for seven years i was trapped in an emotionally and physically abusive marriage i was overweight , exhausted and miserable in i found the courage to leave , packing my two , three and five year old children in the car and driving away eventually i got a part time job and slowly began to rebuild my confidence my body however , was still struggling to cope with the stress and anxiety i developed axillae hyperhidrosisexcessive sweating of the underarms , which had a detrimental impact on my confidence aluminium chloride antiperspirants did n't help and i ended up having to suffer botox injections in my armpits every twelve months i sobbed every time as the pain was horrific it was following one exceptionally painful session that i drove home , tears falling down my face , and vowed to never go through that again this is when i found reiki healing and began on my holistic journey to better health and wellbeing changing my lifestyle was n't the upheaval i had anticipated eating a healthier diet , drinking plenty of water and switching to herbal teas , all contributed to a better version of myself i still loved a glass of wine and a large pepperoni pizza , but as i delved deeper into alternative health i realised this was the path i had been looking for in , after putting myself through night school and re training , i started my own holistic health business , body soul holistics a ladies only spa offering reiki , reflexology , massage and meditation classes it was my way of helping other ladies , who were going through a tough time or a life changing event , to enjoy a time out with an understanding therapist who had 'been there , done that' more recently i developed a range of monthly workshops that i hold at a local venue these events cover topics such as facing fears , finding out who you are and visualising your future they have been well received and are great fun at the beginning of each workshop i talk about motivation , and the tools we all possess to be able to motivate ourselves and improve our lives i use these tools every day of my life and are constantly adding to them as i meet more incredible teachers these people show themselves when you are ready to learn a lesson , and their insights are of true value look and listen , be mindful and keep your thoughts positive and you too will be on the road to better wellbeing i hope you enjoyed this post and my infographic , please feel free to share it i would love to hear your thoughts and if you have any valuable self help tools that you would like to share with others photographs courtesy of freedigitalphotos net
