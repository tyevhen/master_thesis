they say hindsight is i 'd have to agree on successive days this week , thursday and friday , i had the opportunity to reflect on what might have been if only i 'd made different decisions in the past those are not nice thoughts to have , nor are they at all productive , but have them i did on thursday , i met with my orthodontist and an oral surgeon regarding my frustrating teeth if you recall , the primary reason i entered into the braces proposition two years ago was because of my year old canine baby tooth it was loose , and i feared it would decay and fall out any day the permanent tooth was stuck up under my gum tissue it never erupted , as they say in the biz , but it was there the orthodontist assured me he was sure he could pull the permanent tooth into place in years , he said , he had only had one or two instances where he was n't able to pull the permanent tooth into place two years and two oral surgeries later , and over a year without a canine tooth in the front of my mouth , my orthodontist and oral surgeon agreed the permanent tooth was not going to budge any further it is ankylosed in bone i will have my third oral surgery , to remove the permanent tooth entirely , on february th after letting the area heal for at least four months , and only after my orthodontic treatment has totally straightened my teeth , can i begin the nine month process of getting an implant this was not what i wanted to hear , and the news made me sincerely question my decision to begin this process at all my braces have already been on longer than originally planned , and we 're nowhere near done i'm going to have to practice a ton of acceptance and patience for perhaps another year or more ! the thought of it weighs me down while that frustrating news weighed on me , i nevertheless drove to work friday morning with a bit of optimism i planned to finally accept the full time job offered to me in december as soon as i arrived my supervisor informed me she needed to speak with me for a couple of minutes good , i joked , as i wanted to speak to her , too before i could tell her my big news , acceptance of the position i had been doing for several weeks as an on call employee , she told me they needed to cut back my hours she pulled the job offer out from under me they wanted to keep me on , she said , three days per week instead of four , and as an on call rather than a regular , permanent employee so no benefits , no guarantee of hours , no paid time off , no health insurance , no dental insurance , no retirement account i was stunned all the benefits of a full time position , the benefits i had been happily running through my head that very morning , were no longer an option just like that the self recrimination began immediately damn depression ! if only i had n't needed several weeks to see if i could tolerate full time hours , i thought if only i had accepted the offer sooner , i 'd very likely have all those benefits right now but it will not be i'm grateful they still want me to work for them as an on call employee i enjoy working there but as an on call employee , my work schedule is much more tenuous i do want a regular position with benefits and regularly scheduled hours and now i know i can tolerate working up to hours per week i will again have to practice patience and acceptance as i wait for something else , i hope , to come along i'm still reeling a little bit from both of these disappointments i'm probably being a bit hard on myself , too , as i feel i could have avoided both situations with different decisions in the past but thinking that way does me no good whatsoever i know that hindsight may be , but like i said , it 's also totally unproductive from this moment , all i can do is move forward , so i'm going to try my best to do just that and only that life has thrown me a few curve balls lately but if i want to keep my mental health stable , i need to focus less on the swings and misses and more on the next pitch i know that , too carry on , my friends
