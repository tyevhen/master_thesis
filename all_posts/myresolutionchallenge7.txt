march review i m continuing my monthly blog review with a recap of march i find this is the ideal way to assess the posts i ve written and the interaction they received , as well as share the links in case anyone missed one how was march ? stats it s interesting to see the difference in views this month overall , the blog received , new visits which is incredible however , this is a large dip in views based on the first two months of the year i know that my own blog viewing has slipped as real life takes a hold the initial buzz of a new year has settled down as we steam towards spring and summer at an astonishing rate is this normal ? do we all start the year with good intentions to read more and learn something new ? i believe we do my good intentions are still there even though i seem to be busier than ever at the moment , so not only is my blog reading hitting a slump , but my blog promotion is also affected only by checking my stats on a monthly basis did i flag this up , so i m glad i started doing this as bloggers , we spend so much time and energy preparing and writing our blog posts so if we don t spend an equal amount of time promoting them we aren t doing ourselves any justice the most popular post of the month was womenin business , a post i wrote after attending the women in business conference on international women s day published posts week chakras for beginners week women in business week the trials and tribulations of teenage parenting week march in review guest post i ve written a few posts for later in the year , but no guest posts were published in march goals for april i continue to work on my personal development and have come across important lessons that i believe will help others who may be struggling with their health , happiness , or goal setting i thought it would be the perfect time to blog about creativity and dreams this month , so check back every monday for a new post over to you your mission if you choose to accept it is i thought it might be a fun twist if at the end of every monthly review i set you some fun and thought provoking exercises i want you to think about the following questions , grab your journal and note down any thoughts or feelings that bubble to the surface or feel free to add your thoughts in the comments below q what did i learn last month ? q what roles do i play in my life ? mother , wife husband , manager , volunteer q what are my goals for each role ? i ll add another three questions to the april review you don t need to share your answers they re for your personal development if you can keep all your notes together in one journal then by the end of the year , you ll have a great overview of to work with when you want to do a review , set goals , or release anything that isn t serving your greater purpose until next month
