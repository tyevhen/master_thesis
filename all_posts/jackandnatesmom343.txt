excellent weekend ! i would probably say this no matter what just because of the weather , which is heavenly , but it was made extra special by a very alert , verbal nathan as usual , john and i are trying not to get too excited but we did just start him on the speak smooth this past week , so fingers crossed today was an especially good day for him we went to our favorite haunt , the airport playground this morning , and nate really enjoyed climbing all over the place he did his usual sitting on the ground and digging through the recycled tire ground cover for minutes at a time thing , but he also played with daddy quite a bit got a few good shots he conked out on the drive home at around and slept until about , which is a pretty good nap for him he woke up ready to go and more alert than we have seen him in awhile he had n't had lunch yet so i put him up in his seat he immediately started pointing around the room , saying that over and over again he has n't pointed constructively in a really long time this made us feel a little giddy then he said more cup and more bread we are noticing some more word phrases like this lately we have been the meanest parents on earth for quite awhile , refusing to get him more unless he says or at least indicates in some way exactly what he wants it seems to be paying off his mimi came for a visit , and while we were sitting there talking , he kept saying more again and again since he was n't telling us what he wanted we were studiously ignoring him all of the sudden we hear i want more ! thank god he said it in front of adults , or we would n't believe it ourselves this was really really big for him later he walked over to his school backpack , pulled on it and said go bye bye holy mother of moses ! here are a few more shots of him focused on his books so sweet , and new for him john , nate and i were hanging out in the kitchen while jack and mimi were playing and nate started in with one of his favorite games with mommy it 's kind of embarrassing , but he likes to smack my head to the side while i make this ridiculous noise and then laugh like a little maniac he also loves to shove his finger down my throat not so funny to mommy please excuse my presence in the below video i just wanted you to see natey having fun and really engaging i also wanted you to see how affectionate he can be i hear stories from other parents of children with autism about how disconnected they sometimes feel from their children how they never get hugs , or eye contact , how they feel like their kids do n't even notice when they 're not there i do n't know if i could live with that , honestly i am so so lucky that this boy is so loving
