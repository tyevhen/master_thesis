ask the masked amhp for the answers to your thorny mha related problems he might know the answer or not the masked amhp 's postbag continues to be inundated with enquiries concerning sec aftercare difficulties often arise in connection with what sec aftercare does and does not cover , and the relationship between sec aftercare and the provisions for continuing healthcare an amhp asks i am working with someone who is subject to sec and has a hour care package we pay for she has a number of physical health problems which are getting worse and is currently on a medical ward her discharge is delayed because she requires a significant increase in her care package and we are arguing about who pays if she does n't meet the criteria for continuing healthcare surely it should n't be mental health ? argument is it should be as she 's sec the masked amhp replies sec is very clearly only designed to meet aftercare needs arising from the patient 's mental disorder it is not unusual for people to have both a mental disorder and physical health problems an example was a man with schizophrenia and friedrich 's ataxia he was placed in a care home for physical disability and the cost of that was met by physical disability services , and he was expected to contribute towards this cost a relative writes to the masked amhp with a problem about the local authority s calculation of care needs under sec my father for many years had undiagnosed longstanding complex mental health issues including personality disorder hypochondria last year following a lifetime of being fairly impossible for the family to get along with he was eventually diagnosed with vascular dementia turning very nasty in the excellent nursing home he had agreed to go into , they applied for continuing healthcare funding and he was sent to a psychiatric ward for full assessment under sec when the weeks came to an end , they tried to detain him further on a dols but his behaviour was such that he had to be detained under sec the nursing home had applied for chc funding to deal with his attention seeking behaviour and to re integrate him successfully there were several weeks of arguments about this so his stay was extended it was eventually agreed to discharge him with temporary funding asked about where we would like him to go the family expressed strong preference to return him to the original nursing home though there were suggestions of placements very much further afield which would have been impossible for family friends to visit he has now been in the home for some months and is mostly calm however , the cost of the home is over per week without the nursing element which is paid by the nhs though my father is not badly off , and our main concern is to ensure he is in the right place , our mother remains in the marital home which needs to be maintained and she has needed some temporary care which may of course be needed again and more frequently we have been told verbally that the s aftercare payable for dad will be around per month it has not yet been released of course the attendance allowance was removed during his hospital stay and i assume will not be reinstated we have wondered how the amount of s funding is arrived at , as no one has been able to tell us i do not believe that there is anywhere which could offer care at that amount in the area and the staff at the present home have been very supportive to us all so a move would not really be acceptable the masked amhp replies the care act has changed some aspects of sec aftercare this includes allowing people to top up their care if they want to stay in a more expensive care home than the la calculates is needed as your father has been detained under sec , he will be entitled to free aftercare for anything connected with mental disorder , whether dementia or psychosis his needs for aftercare should not be assessed on the basis of how much the la can afford , but what his care needs are they might say that his needs can be met in care home a costing per week , but if you wanted him to go in care home b costing per week , then the la should pay the and the patient can then top up this is one of the changes in the care act they cannot state an arbitrary amount , which would not purchase the care that has been identified as needed as a relative , you should be involved in these assessments if an assessment concludes that only the care home you have chosen can provide adequate aftercare , then the la should pay taking into account any chc assessment once your father is out of hospital , he should be entitled to attendance allowance again a worker in a voluntary organisation asks a recent determination from our local community care group states that ' an individual who is funded under sec will only become eligible for nhs continuing healthcare funding following a continuing healthcare assessment when they are discharged from sec or if they develop complex physical healthcare needs ' the determination goes on to say that whilst mental health needs evidenced by challenging behaviour make the person concerned eligible for funding under sec , the person 's nursing needs due to physical health are not of a 'nature , complexity , etc to warrant nhs funding what i 've been unable to clarify in several emails to the continuing care team at said ccg is whether the person 's scoring in those domains related directly to mental health conditions was too low or whether , in fact , they were n't even considered because of a prior eligibility for sec funding i'm a little confused by the distinction that seems evident in the determination , between 'physical health needs' and 'mental health needs' used in determining eligibility for continuing care the masked amhp replies eligibility for sec aftercare is quite distinct from whether or not someone is eligible for continuing healthcare ccg 's have responsibilities for both sec aftercare and continuing healthcare under the mha , both local authorities and ccg 's have a duty to provide aftercare under sec how that aftercare is determined and paid for is a matter between the ccg and the la the health side will generally be delegated to the local mental health trust the department of health document , nhs continuous healthcare frequently asked questions , published in states arrangements under the mental health act are separate and different from nhs continuing healthcare and the two should not be confused it is preferable for a pct to have separate budgets for funding sec and nhs continuing healthcare where they are funded from the same budget they still continue to be distinct and separate legal provisions it also goes on to say it is preferable for a pct to have separate budgets for funding sec and nhs continuing healthcare where they are funded from the same budget they still continue to be distinct and separate legal provisions although that seems clear enough , things have changed since primary care trusts were abolished on march as part of the health and social care act , which created gp led community care groups to replace them these ccgs were often dismayed to discover the expensive continuing healthcare duties that were transferred to them , and many tried to limit expenditure by unfairly and arbitrarily imposing conditions on eligibility it does not necessarily mean that the ccg 's do n't have a requirement to meet these needs , whatever they may say however , the more recent document , nhs continuinghealthcare guide for health and social care practitioners , published by nhs england in states an individual subject to section should only be considered for nhs chc where they have significant healthcare needs which are not related to their mental health aftercare needs it is true that sec aftercare is only designed to meet the specific mental health needs of a patient if they also have physical health or disability needs , these will not be covered by sec the social care needs of a physical disability would be met by the la , but the nursing needs , eg in a nursing home , would be met by health , ie the ccg social care needs for a physical disability would be chargeable to the patient , whereas any specific mental health aftercare needs would not be
