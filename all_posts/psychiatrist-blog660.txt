if you 're looking for a reason to hate psychiatry , i found it for you i just finished reading my lobotomy by howard dully it 's his memoir , focused around the event of a transorbital ice pick lobotomy which he underwent at the age of twelve oy dully talks about his devastating childhood his mother died of cancer when he was five , and his father remarried to his evil step mother he spends a lot of time making the case that she was the problem and he was a normal kid at the time of the lobotomy , he was going to school and had a paper route he does describe himself as a kid who might have had behavior issues for any one of many reasons his step mother seeks the advise of psychiatrists , and dully says she was unhappy with the suggestions she got namely that she was the one with issues until she met dr walter freeman dr freeman is credited with performing over , lobotomies he traveled around the country in his own vehicle , which he dubbed the lobotomobile and performed transorbital lobotomies by inserting a sharp object through the eye sockets no open surgery required no anesthesia required he used electroshock to render his patients unconscious in , howard dully had a lobotomy he had seen dr freeman for visits he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and was offered no other form of treatment no therapy , no medication , no hospitalization he was told he would be undergoing testing and was not told about the lobotomy until after it was done it 's a chilling read , one that still lingers with me days later , and the book was written after npr did a story on howard dully you can listen to that here not one of psychiatry 's finer moments
