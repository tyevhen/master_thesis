it was an animal i did n't even know ! a bird in the middle of the road a goose it was squawking and trying to move it was clearly distressed , and hurt and there were four other geese on the other side of the road , watching , and they were squawking , too why do we get so angry when someone or something dies ? it was an anonymous goose to my dismay , i bawled my eyes out and then got pissed ! i did n't even know the animal , yet i was sad and angry ! a little background in my city , geese are more prevalent than people around one small lake right in the middle of town because of a hydro electric plant , i think , the lake rarely freezes during the winter so this is apparently as far south as some canadian geese ever get up until very recently , the city prided itself on its large goose population in the park , there were even machines where a quarter bought you a bunch of corn , which the geese devoured practically out of your hand within the last few years , however , the novelty wore off , as the goose population and the goose poop swelled ! locals are more likely to think of them as obnoxious , overgrown rats than birds they are n't friendly , not necessarily beautiful , and they wander the streets cars be damned as if they have permanent right of way i was on my way home to ready for my parents' visit my day was done it was beautiful and warm ironically , i had just taken a pleasant moment to view a family of swimming geese before rounding the corner to the horror in the middle of the road horror i quickly pulled my car over and dialed i did n't know what else to do there were cars whizzing by in both directions , some with stricken faces , others oblivious to the suffering before them i ran toward the goose as i talked with , stopping momentarily to retrieve a towel from my trunk they would send someone , to put it out of its misery , but i could n't stand there and watch i spoke gently as i picked it up having just laid its head on the pavement , apparently for the last time , the goose offered no resistance i carried it to the shade of a nearby tree where all was suddenly quiet and still both my goose and the four geese , who now turned and walked silently away it may have died in my hands i do n't know i knelt there with it for several moments , stroking its back , and telling it everything would be okay feeling self conscious , i got up and stood nearby to wait tears welled i felt dumb finally , the city animal control arrived she seemed nice enough when i pointed her toward the goose , but oh , how i wish i had turned away rather than the gentle scoop i naively expected , she yanked it up by its neck and tossed the still warm soul into her truck i cried i'm crying now i got angry i'm angry now i had no idea what happened to the goose , but i was angry at the impatient person who struck it i was angry that person did n't bother to stop did the driver hit the goose on purpose ? probably not i know i felt bad for the geese who apparently made it across witnesses to the suffering perhaps family of the deceased ? and i felt silly for feeling bad i got angry at the inhumanity of the city worker she knew i was watching she knew i was the one who had carried the victim to its resting spot and what about the other residents who were driving , running , biking and strolling by ? did she have to yank it by its neck ? it had barely just died ! and i got angry for being angry , for crying like a fool over i bird i did n't even know perhaps anger is more comfortable than sad i do n't know it bothers me to be so traumatized by this experience , and i almost wish i had n't stopped but i did feeling so traumatized worries me , but i guess i do n't need to figure my feelings out i want to , but i guess i just need to let them be i'm sad and angry about a goose i'm sad and angry about the needless suffering of a goose suffering perhaps i'm sad and angry about suffering and pain i hate suffering and pain i especially hate to witness suffering and pain i wish i had n't but i did and now , i just have to feel it i guess
