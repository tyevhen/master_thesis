source http imentalhealth net mental health disorders eating disorders different side effects of bulimia related video about different side effects of bulimia bulimia side effects bulimia side effects youtube com free yourself from bulimia former international model and bulimia sufferer julie kerr shares a step process for full bulimia different side effects of bulimia commonly question about different side effects of bulimia question what are the different effects that anorexia and bulimia have on your body ? or do they have the same side effects ? answer they aren t the same , at all also , i m guessing you aren t asking this for hmmm which one should i try ? so i won t go on that rant first hand , it s awful because i still hate myself since i let a few people get into my head if it s for a report or something , then fine with anorexia , your body goes into starvation mode you may think that not eating means fat quickly melts away but it doesn t going on a strict diet of vegetables , low carb , low fat , all that will lose more weight than anything else because we have survival instincts in us if our body isn t getting food , it goes , aw sh ! t ! i m in the desert during a famine ! i need to ration myself ! so it eats away the fat slowly , very slowly muscle is also eaten away , so those nice little muscles on your arms or stomach become sagging pieces of skin so when anorexic people think how ugly they are , they can look a bit uglier from when they started then next comes calcium and vitamins meaning bones bulimia does the same effect , but not to such a degree the body sees that the stomach is full and doesn t panic but when it realises there isn t as much food getting digested , it starts to eat away fat this is a quicker process , yes , but acid is thrown up meal after meal , sometimes three meals a day think of how much acid we have in our stomachs to eat away food the stomach lining is replaced once a week just because it s eaten away so often your teeth are rotted away and you get awful breath your enamel is gone , and that stuff doesn t grow back the act mouth wash works , but not that great and you ruin your throat , and you can pull things up further from vomiting too much i knew a girl who could eat a box of cereal in a sitting or a dozen donuts from dunkin donuts where she d work , then go home and throw it up it was because her body was so starved that her stomach had expanded and it kept wanting food her breath stunk and no one wanted her at their house as we knew she d just eat and eat so they both have their side effects as you call them they re both deadly the same things can be achieved in half the time from diet and exercise , with a lot more happiness , and no real i hate myself i can t eat food in the future question will the effects of bulimia ever go away completely ? recovered bulimics , help ? i ve been bulimic for years really , really bulimic i binge and purge in the double digits , daily i m underweight , and look gross my potassium s usually in the s , most other electrolytes are off as well i now have a heart condition my hair is disgusting , very very thin don t get me started on my teeth bottom line i ve effed up my body i know this my question is , if i could even stop , how long will it take for me to stabilize medically ? i was in inpatient treatment for months and my nutritional levels were still out of whack after being behavior free for months more important to me than the physical if i could find the willpower to stop , will i ever really be okay with not doing it ? i ve gone a pretty long time in tx without purging before , but the ed is raging the whole time i got out , and it became too much within weeks so here i am i ve been , and am currently going , to doctors i see a therapist , i ve been on and am now off antidepressants terrible side effects , tried different ones , no dice telling me to go to a doctor is pointing out the obvious i want to know if it ever really stops answer getting over an eating disorder completely is very difficult but accepting that you have one is a big step ! first you have to deal with the physical side and gain weight your doctors and therapist should be able to help you with this , finding the best way for you to do so yes i know this is a lot easier said than done , but it makes a huge difference , your mood should improve , making it easier to deal with the ed when you are at a healthier weight some problems should get better , like potassium and electrolyte levels your hair should improve over time , but will probably never return to how it used to be some of the other effects may not fade , but i can also only tell you from an anorexics point of view the mental part is the hardest to get over , and will take a long time , probably several years you just have to be really strong , and support from both professional and others does help although it may seem hard to imagine life without the ed , you will gradually break out of it , and it is the most liberating feeling ! so don t abandon hope , it is not an impossible task to get over an eating disorder even though it feels like it ! i does stop ! i hope you can get better and wish you luck ! sources experience question have you taken adderall for bulimia ? what was the effect and did it help ? what about side effects and obssessive thoughts ? i took lexapro at a very small dose and was really lethargic now my dr is thinking about adderall is that targeting a different par of the brain or something ?
