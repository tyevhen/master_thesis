working on some learnings from my time in hospital a few years ago , how you feel physically and mentally are very closely linked i have booked a deep tissue massage for lunch time in the hope it will induce a relaxing and productive weekend i am extremely tense and my shoulders are hunched up i'm looking forward to an hour of bliss ! i am working from home on easy stress free stuff this morning o but i feel awful about the stress i am causing others by not doing the most urgent stuff 'o still at least i am working !
