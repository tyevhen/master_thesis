dear a b curtiss , i am currently working through issues with my son 's depression and have urged my son to adopt many of the thinking patterns you have described he was diagnosed schizophrenic a few years ago and had never appeared depressed he has been off medication for almost a year , receiving psychotherapy , vitamin supplements and other interesting holistic interventions he now seems depressed and emotional i consider this a tremendous improvement ! we are in the middle of all this right now and sometimes it is hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel when this happens , i turn to the web for inspiration today i found it at your website i have ordered your book from amazon best regards , r a dear r a thank you for your letter my book depression is a choice is the philosophy of how you get out of depression my book brainswitch out of depression is the neuroscience of how you get out of depression and it is a bit more user friendly to read , more self helpy , if you will it continues to amaze me how doctors and psychiatrists imagine that people can get out of depression who have no idea how their own brains work , how they get from one thought to another as far as i know i am the first person to connect the process of pain perception with getting out of depression i 'll be glad to answer any questions you might have a b curtiss dear a b thanks for the extra tip i 'll also order the brainswitch book for my son he is trying hard and coming at in in different ways is very helpful he is also doing the alexander technique , which seems like it is about choices and actions i will be excited to read your books and should i have any questions , i will ask one very good point you made on your website is about how your brain reacts when you think of a lemon i was so discouraged by seeing pictures of supposedly damaged schizophrenic brains , until i thought , for heaven 's sake if i thought about sex , my brain image would look at certain way nobody is trying to make sex a brain disease a b curtiss dear r a yes , it is a shame that people are being made ill just because people say they 're ill slowly people are starting to see they have been ill served , pardon the pun , by the psychiatric community who deal with things from a pathological view when they do n't have to
