first off a big thanks to kurt harris over at panu for his props for my blog at the same time he recommended andrew 's glad to see you back into blogging , and professor gumby is certainly a fascinating fellow a bit more housecleaning there are a couple new studies out about alzheimer 's and mild cognitive impairment and ketosis that i want to cover , and i 'll probably get to that this weekend however , this morning into my mailbox tumbled a new study that has evolutionary psychiatry written all over it or maybe not , but it is cool nevertheless , human tears contain a chemosignal from pretty much the premier academic science journal in the world , science actually this one is in science express , which is the advanced online publication arm of science the paper starts out with charles darwin , and that 's always a good sign basically the evolutionary question is why do we cry ? it builds on nicely from yesterday 's post on sex emotions are troublesome , after all while some like love are typically sweet and enjoyable , others like grief are just plain painful we really do n't have much choice about feeling them if you somehow suppress anger or grief , for example , it usually pops out in other unhealthy ways , such as anxiety , substance abuse , or irritability take it from a psychiatrist the best thing to do with your powerful , driving emotions is to feel them and to act on what they are telling you in a reasonable way that would not usually include busting a beer bottle over someone 's head when you are angry for example , i'm still pretty angry about what i consider the misappropriation of medical and nutritional science to peddle cheap commodity grains at the expense of our health each time i read good calories , bad calories fats , carbs , and the controversial science of diet and health vintage , it gets thrown across the room a few times so i write a blog , and i promote the blogs of like minded folks to the right not because many of them also have me on their blogrolls , but because i like how they put their minds to the real problem of nutrition , lifestyle , and health in the st century , and i inevitably learn something from them but back to the paper these researchers started out small they took the tears of two women , ages and , who watched sad movies in isolation they also took a vial of saline that had been trickled over the skin of the women and let each of young men mean age have a sniff the men could n't tell a difference in smell between the emotional tears and the saline then another men mean age smelled the tears of three women mean age or saline and filled out some rating scales about the experience then the young men were given a pad pasted to their upper lip with microliters of tears or saline dribbled onto the pad while thus anointed , the young men were asked to rate picture 's of women 's faces for sadness and how sexually attractive the faces were , and men were given a standard questionnaire to assess empathy each subject in double blind fashion , and on different days did the tests both with a saline and tear stained pad tears or saline did n't change the men 's empathy ratings or their ratings of sadness on the women 's faces , but out of men smelling tears found the women 's faces to be less sexually attractive p the researchers at this point brought in men and used a sensory paradigm to generate negative emotions , all the while measuring heart rate , sweating , respiration rate , skin temperature , and self rating of mood and arousal salivary levels of testosterone were also measured before , during , and after smelling the tears or trickled saline of donor women after sniffing , the subjects watched sad movies one of the news reports mentioned terms of endearment once again , the subjective arousal of tear sniffing men was decreased , as was the level of arousal in general measured by sweating , respiration , etc , and , more tellingly , the levels of testosterone in saliva dropped then the researchers got very cute and this last bit is likely why the paper made it into science they took young men with saline or tear stained nose pads and had them watch sexually arousing movies and view sexy pictures then stuck them into fmris the sexual arousal signal apparently is visible in the hypothalamus and left fusiform gyrus of the brain , and within these regions , activity was significantly lower in men who were sniffing tears all in all , ladies , if you are looking to dampen the mood , take him to a tear jerker otherwise , maybe stick with an action film or comedy also , tears may be a quick way to diffuse a man 's overall emotional arousal it may be an ancient hormonal way to tell an aggressive man to back off now other animals also have tears , though it is thought humans are the only ones to shed emotional tears in any event , the lacrimal secretions of mice contain chemosignals , as do human urine and sweat chemosignals in mammalian studies have uncovered pheromones that increase receptive sexual behavior or decrease arousal as in this study , while other chemosignals trigger sexual maturation or provide information such as kinship this may be why women will tend to be most attracted to men who have the most different major histocompatibility genes i 'll let the researchers finish up the findings pose many questions what is the identity of the active compound s in tears ? moreover , could the emotional or hormonal state menstrual phase , oral contraceptives of the crier experimenter influence the outcome ? in turn , what if any are the signals in men 's tears children 's tears , and what are the effects of all these within rather than across gender ? my question is what are we doing to our behaviors by masking scents with bathing , deodorant , and perfume ? would i be a more perceptive psychiatrist if my patients stopped bathing ? hmmm
