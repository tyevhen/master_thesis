the following clip tickles me endlessly especially at around seconds when gilbert ryle is talking about a rabbit whose limited cognitive repertoire constraints the kinds of emotions he may feel e g indignation is apparently not an option although perhaps he 'could feel anger of a sorts if another rabbit was going orf with his wife or something of the sorts ' one can understand ryle 's inclination to think indignation a richer affect than anger , hence one not so readily ascribed to the not so behaviourally and culturally well endowed lowly bunny but it occurs to me , when i put my mind to the task of discerning rabbit affectivity , that i can rather more easily imagine rabbit behaviour that seemed expressive of indignation than i can of anger i can imagine a rabbit becoming aggressive , for example perhaps when fighting , but would i really think it angry ? however , without pretending to any ethological prowess , i can i think imagine something at least akin to a snooty , shunning , rabbit taking offence
