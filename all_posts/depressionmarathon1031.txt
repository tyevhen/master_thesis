we finally had the opportunity to bury my friend , stan , yesterday he died several states away a few months ago , the victim of alcoholism it was a nice service performed in the very church in which he was baptized after the service , his ashes were buried in the family plot right across the street i finally got to say goodbye the church was filled to the rafters with fellow alcoholics , which made communion interesting ! do n't worry , stan would have loved that observation stan had an impact on everyone he met he had a kind heart , a great sense of humor , and a generous soul if only he could have stayed sober burying him yesterday made his death real and reignited my sadness he 's really gone i miss him i miss him a lot rest in peace , stan
