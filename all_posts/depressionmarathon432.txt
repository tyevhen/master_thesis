my legs were protesting just a bit during my mile run this morning i'm currently in the middle of my heaviest weeks of marathon training i'm also in the th week of my kettlebell and suspension training class we are working especially hard in that class we 've learned all the moves , so our instructor has us lifting and moving non stop for the entire minutes now i came home last night feeling like a wet noodle i have my last level one class tomorrow night , and then we have one week off prior to beginning weeks of level two classes the heavier training is definitely paying off in more ways than one when running , i 've noticed i can conquer hills with less effort than i required previously the weight training has apparently helped my shape , or at least d thought so i received more than one compliment from him when he visited this past weekend that was nice the training schedule and classes are tough , but i do appreciate the benefits gaining toughness , whether through lifting weights or by increasing mileage , will improve my running speed and efficiency this weekend i will run my first of three scheduled milers prior to my marathon i'm not too worried about it , as the miler , with a mile race in the middle of it , went well last saturday i do think my legs will continue to be tired , however that 's the way it is at this point in a marathon training cycle it 's the usual fatigue getting through it means getting stronger getting stronger that 's what my training is all about i enjoy the process the journey to race day is fun for me i appreciate training 's benefits but working hard and accomplishing the smaller daily goals really satisfies me in this case , i relish the journey at least as much if not more than the destination
