before we get into the general subject of cancer i want to expand on my previous article on natural killer cells nk cells the research we did years ago showed enhanced nk production after one year of our therapy , and by that i assume better control of cancer that is what these cells do look out for developing cancer cells and attack and devour but why would reliving those early imprints increase production of nk cells ? here i have to make an assumption when we have traumas during womb life there is a deregulation of many biochemicals , hormones and neurotransmitters the whole system , in short , changes to accommodate the input and what that does is alter set points how do we know that ? because in all of our studies we have found that set points seem to change after therapy and normalize thus , for example , nk cells seem to change set points and come back to normal after one year of our therapy as do the levels of the stress hormone , cortisol so once we go back to those generating sources , those early imprints , the system appears to re regulate itself back to what it should have been before the trauma intruded itself our therapy seems to erase the input and allow the cells to normalize it is as if the trauma never happened which is why i maintain that we can go back and undo and redo our early lives the mechanism for this may well be the pattern of methylation that seals in the trauma cancer is characterized by methylation imbalance baylin , et al , there are other factors , as well , which are being sussed out anew each and every day by biochemists and other specialists we will leave that to those experts but it seems as though we are reversing those early changes that caused a detour of biochemical set points along with this was a rerouting of brain circuits as well the neurotic system changed i am painting in broad strokes for the moment , details can be found in my book life before birth so what happens when the nk cells are increased ? we have a stronger army to fight cancer , an army that was weakened by trauma occurring during our womb life and also possibly during the birth process the system has a normal amount now and can amass a greater force to fight cellular anomaly the cells seem to know when something is amiss and rush to correct it in the same way that repair cells rush in to stem the flow of blood and help in healing when we cut ourselves we are a naturally healing system when given the chance and what is wonderful is that we always have the chance in our lives to go back and restabilize the system that is why when nk cells are extracted from tumor cells , processed and reintroduced to the system there is an increase in cancer fighting ability here is the good news when the nk army is bolstered there is less cancer and when there are even metastasized cells the nk cells can fight each and every appearance of abnormal cells , no matter where they are , and stop them in their tracks it is not like chemotherapy , a poison that destroys the malignant cells and also healthy cells along with them here , it is but a matter of increasing the health of the cells in order to combat the intruders a much healthier way to go in other words , the system now has a normal amount of nk cells , which it should have had early on but did not and the same trauma that may have lowered the set points of nk cells could have also increased the likelihood of cancer for example , it can epigenetically affect the tumor suppression genes , leaving the system open to later cancer the problem is that the distance between the early trauma and the appearance of cancer at forty is so vast as to be incomprehensible it is only when we allow patients to back and relive early trauma that we see the connection and for now , it still it has to be an assumption this can never happen with a cognitive therapy that never touches deep lying imprints that deviated and deviate the system intellectual therapies never operate on the levels that set off deviations they operate on the derivatives , the effluvia of the early imprints such as deviations in perception or thought patterns or learning treating all that never makes a profound change and who suffers ? the patient baylin , s b , herman , j g , graff , j r , vertino , p m , issa , j p alterations in dna methylation a fundamental aspect of neoplasia adv cancer res
