working wipes me out ! wait , let me start again i am really enjoying , and grateful for the renewed i e normal energy i 've had lately however , working wipes me out ! just hours yesterday required an immediate minute nap today , my minute nap did n't even dent the exhaustion following a hour work day it 's hard to imagine that i used to work hours per week and run miles ! now , exercise is totally out of the question on work days , and hours slams against my upper limits of functionality i would n't be surprised if i turned into a pumpkin , or something equally useless , at hour it 's weird it 's frustrating another reminder that i am not normal anymore another cue to redefine normal so it more accurately reflects my life today how convenient unfortunately , redefining the word does not erase the memories of my previously normal life did i mention how grateful i am for the renewed energy i 've experienced lately ?
