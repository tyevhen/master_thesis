i'm going to try hard to not sound maudlin , pitiful , and pathetic , but i'm having a hard time today and need to do something drastic i'm so neurologically off i ca n't even walk well but i can sit in front of a computer and vegetate i believe i 've done enough of that today so instead of doing that for the rest of the night i'm going to write this thursday thirteen entry up , take some notes on my next article on punctuality and the punctuality police , sketch as best as i can , and watch a movie with my daughters i am sharing here , but i do not want your sympathy please do not feel sorry for me no teary eyed comments no snide comments either i am coping , albeit grumpily tomorrow will be a new day and i'm positive that this ticking episode will end soon it 's just that pulling off christmas took it 's toll on me here we go a list of things i wish i could do right now but ca n't because i'm experiencing what i call a slow tic day when messages from my mind to the rest of my body seem to be passed by carrier pigeons with adhd ca n't talk with my daughters or wife because i sound like max headroom with alzheimer 's disease ca n't walk well because my right foot insists on curling ca n't dance away the christmas pounds see above ca n't play the pennywhistle ca n't play my chromonica ca n't draw well oh , it 's baaaaad ca n't get out of my own way ca n't handle noise at all today ca n't pull myself away from my mac tucked away deep inside my studio in the basement ca n't stop snacking what is it with ticking and snacking ? especially intense flavors i almost crave those flavors , from spicy hot ramen to sour candies , when i am ticking i wonder if it 's my brain trying to fend off depression ca n't focus very well my mind is flitting from subject to subject like a strung out butterfly hooked on buttercups ca n't be productive that really bothers me this exercise is helping me cognitively and i'm kicking myself for not having thought of it earlier of course , i ca n't kick myself very well no coordination so i wave my leg at myself and call it good ca n't imagine how i'm going to post on other people 's thursday thirteens tonight i'm so out of it i know i 'll end up sticking my digital foot into my binary mouth but if i do n't post on other tts i 'll miss the swarm guess i 'll resign myself to missing the swarm and post thoughtful comments tomorrow i ca n't bring myself to leave empty happy tt comments instead i do n't feel sorry for myself just frustrated time is so precious i hate to waste it and now maybe i can go do something with my night , even if i have to hobble physically and mentally around this list made me angry i am tired of having life robbed from me because of disabilities one purpose for my blog is to reach out to others who are discouraged because of their disabilities i 've focused on ad hd , depression , and motor tic disorders , but any type of disability can be discouraging the mental ones seem to be hardest , however , because they lack sympathy and understanding in our fellow man i blogged about it two years ago when i broke my toe so i want to share with people my struggle so they become inspired they do n't have to buy into the lie that they need a psychiatrist and his medications to cope with life for the rest of their life they do n't have to buy into the lie that they are a loser and useless either we have the power in ourselves to do more than we think sometimes we forget that , as i forgot that today , because we are so busy struggling with our problems however , positive thinking wo n't make me magically stop ticking , but it will help my mindset so that i cope with the ticking better already i can sense a change inside myself and i'm anxious to act on it if you blog , please tell me thirteen things about yourself and link it here oh , and try to refrain from linking here if you do n't have a thursday thirteen post i 'll just end up removing your link links to other thursday thirteens ! blog owner please log in at blenza com if you wish to enable this widget thursday thirteen tags technorati add adhd ad hd depression disability thursday thirteen like reading the splintered mind ? share articles with your friends , link from your blog , or subscribe !
