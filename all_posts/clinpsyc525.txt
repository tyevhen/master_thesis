eighty six percent of the recent decline in u s teen pregnancy rates is the result of improved contraceptive use , while a small proportion of the decline can be attributed to teens waiting longer to start having sex , according to a report by john santelli , md , mph , department chair and professor of clinical population and family health at the mailman school of public health and published in the january issue of the american journal of public health the scientific findings indicate that abstinence promotion , in itself , is insufficient to help adolescents prevent unintended pregnancies snip the authors conclude that this study raises serious questions about the value of the federal government 's funding of abstinence only education programs that prohibit information about the benefits of condoms and contraception they suggest that public policies and programs in the united states and elsewhere should vigorously promote provision of accurate information on contraception and on sexual behavior and relationships , support increased availability and accessibility of contraceptive services and supplies for adolescents , and promote the value of responsible and protective behaviors , including condom and contraceptive use and pregnancy planning source my view researchers like santelli can do all the research they want showing that bush and company 's ludicrous push toward abstinence only education is harmful , but since the administration clearly seems to think they are taking orders from god , why would they let something as pesky as science get in the way ?
