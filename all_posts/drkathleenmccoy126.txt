shortly after a friend of mine lost his father his last parent and last parental generation family member recently , he looked at me , suddenly tearful , and said i'm stepping up to the turnstile it 's my turn now i understood his feelings of grief , vulnerability and dread i reached the turnstile nine years ago today when aunt molly , my last parental generation relative , died suddenly , a partially completed new york times crossword puzzle on her lap after your last family elder has died , you really do experience a major transition as you become the family elder or one of the elders and have a new sense of mortality and after awhile , it 's hard to imagine life being different during a dinner with several neighbors not long ago , someone mentioned a mutual friend who was in l a to visit her year old daughter who is experiencing a personal crisis my next door neighbor louise said i know how her daughter feels she feels bad and wants her mother that 's how i still am if i feel bad or if i am feeling especially good , i reach for the phone and call my mom ! i was intially startled then i remembered that louise , who is , has a mother who is and doing well for her age imagine ! there is a part of me that ca n't imagine having a mother my parents both died when i was it has been more than three decades since i heard my mother 's voice and , before i turned , i had lost every member of my family 's parental generation all of my aunts and uncles while still in my fifties , i was experiencing turnstile time what does turnstile time mean to me ? it means being more in touch with my own mortality i can imagine dying now it has happened to a lot of people i love our parents are a barrier of sorts between us and the inevitability of death when death happens to them , it takes on a whole new reality for us i think about what i want to leave behind to improve the lives of others , family members or dear friends like money or special items or simply the feeling that they were dearly loved and valued i think about what i do n't want to leave behind piles of junk and excess belongings for others to dig through , distribute or dispose bob and i spent an entire year shoveling out my parents' square foot home and then my brother spent another year making the house liveable and on most horrid day of our marriage , bob and i did a major overhauling of aunt molly 's house after her death our real estate agent had held a disastrous open house the weekend before potential buyers , one after the other , made negative comments about aunt molly 's wall of bracket and board bookcases lining the small living room and the monterey coast wallscape in her den the agent called us with a directive to remove the bookcases , patch and paint the walls and also paint over the wallscape in the den sighing deeply but with firm resolve , bob and i drove the miles to molly 's house the next saturday , expecting a very full day of work in the middle of our efforts , the agent called again , telling us in a panic that a potential buyer was coming over the next day , and that he had a special concern another complaint people had voiced during the open house was that the carpeting smelled faintly of cat pee this potential buyer was concerned that even the foundation of the house might smell of cat urine so the agent had a further directive tear up and remove all the carpeting from the house and then swab the concrete slab with bleach and then buy and install new carpeting bob and i looked at each other aghast suddenly realizing that , in order to do all this , we would have to just the two of us remove every stick of furniture from the house we did it but it was n't pretty we screamed at each other we cried we sweated we cursed we embraced and apologized but we did it the house clean , bright , newly painted and carpeted sold for an excellent price several weeks later since then , bob and i keep vowing to each other that we do n't want to put any of our survivors through such a major clean up we cut down on many of our possessions when we moved from california to arizona nearly three years ago and i am still in the process of sorting through things i personally treasure to determine what might be junk to someone else and what might best become a digital file we have completed power of attorney , medical directive and legal directives regarding our pets in the event of our disability or demise we know it 's not a question of if but when we 've made a resolution to write directive letters for immediate survivors and friends with instructions as aunt molly so thoughtfully and wisely did it is n't a matter of being morbid , but being prepared i have a friend whose spouse wo n't even consider thinking about a will or trust at ! he does n't want to think about dying but it makes sense to entertain that notion long enough to execute a will or trust , power of attorney and health directives then in a very real sense , you 're free to go on with living your life to the fullest awareness of our mortality and the fragile nature of life that comes as we step up to the turnstile is also evident in other ways thinking about how we will manage or not when we are older and need assistance with the tasks of daily living does long term care insurance make sense ? a move to a continuing care community ? if , at some point , neither of us can drive , will continuing to live here in rural arizona be feasible ? these are n't constant pre occupations but thoughts and questions that occur to us now that our elders are gone , now that we are living our retirement dream , now that is n't that far away , now that we have friends in their eighties and nineties who are experiencing some challenges and limitations while we ca n't possibly know what the future holds for us , we need to consider all the possibilities although every one of my elders on both sides of my family succumbed to sudden cardiac death with very little disability or illness preceding death i ca n't necessarily count on having the same good luck , preferably some years hence then there are moments when we consider our proximity to life 's turnstile with more positive thoughts and questions what do we still want to experience and accomplish in our lives ? which people , what places do we long to see ? now is the time to make happy plans to do the traveling we long to do , to pursue the interests and projects that mean the most to us , to tell those who matter just how much we love them there is no better time than right now
