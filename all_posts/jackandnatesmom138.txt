if you recall , a few weeks ago i was ready to pull out of the memantine study at children 's national medical center after they messed up jack 's blood draw , stuck him twice and wanted him to come back in for a third go at it http jackandnatesmom blogspot com livid html ok , so that blood draw went pretty well , i put emla on right as we left the house , no biggie they apologized and things were ok tomorrow is our next visit , just routine we had to reschedule , no big deal i just got a voice mail they forgot to add one of the tubes to the blood draw last time long story short , they need to draw his blood again ! ! ! ! honest to pete all of this for tubes of blood ? it would be one thing if he was supposed to get his blood drawn each time he was seen at least then i could have prepared him instead , they leave me this message at almost pm when the only way i convinced jack the visit would be fine tomorrow was by telling him that this time he did n't have to get a test now mommy is a liar and i am really questioning the competence of this team this kind of screw up is one thing the first time , but when it keeps happening over and over again well i'm starting to wonder grrrrrrr
