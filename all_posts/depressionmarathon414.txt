i used to really look forward to tapering for my marathons i think that must have been when i was less experienced i mean , what 's not to love about slowly decreasing my running mileage over a period of three weeks ? you 'd think i 'd feel rested and fresh by week three well , this is week three of my taper , and i feel like crud ! fortunately , i 've learned from my experience crud is normal yep , feeling like crud in the final days before a marathon is fairly normal for me , and i dislike it very much ! i feel tired , and heavy , and slow my legs ache , are as heavy as lead , and i swear i 've gained pounds despite running less , and as of this week , no longer lifting weights , my body feels fatigued even stranger , i tire easily , at work and at home i just want to take a nap it 's weird , but it 's normal i 've been through this at least times before over the last three weeks , i 've gone from running over miles a week and aggressively lifting weights to barely running and not lifting weights at all , yet i feel weary and dense thankfully , it will all be over soon in days i 'll be on the starting line i ca n't wait i ca n't wait to run it 's hard to know if i'm prepared when i feel like this certainly i do n't feel prepared right now i need to constantly reassure myself i know i 've done the training i 've run the speed workouts , the long runs , and all the miles in between i 've pressed , swung , and lifted kettlebells to condition my muscles , and i 've further strengthened my core with suspension training i put in the time needed i ca n't allow myself to fret about feeling crappy soon it will end the only thing left to do now is wait i 've packed my bag , although i'm sure i 'll check it again i 've lined up the dog sitter i 've planned my meals , my clothing , and my race nutrition i 'll leave thursday morning for the hour drive north i'm going to spend some time with my family before saturday 's race it 's always nice to run grandmas , as some of my family , including two of my young nephews , are usually able to watch hopefully , the weather will cooperate and i hope my fatigue and heaviness give way to lightness and speed on race day we shall see
