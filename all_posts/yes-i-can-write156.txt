there have been some interesting comments on my last unschooling post ! and several things said lead me to want to elaborate on a few things each post i write is fairly self contained i usually focus on one thing it 's a single post amongst a much larger body of writing to be found on this blog so i do not try and talk about absolutely everything that could be related to anything i'm saying about the main point of the post that would lead to very long , rambling , and unpleasant to read posts i also do n't tend to add disclaimers i think that much of the time , disclaimer type comments thrown in are distracting and weaken the impact of a post , so i only add that type of comment when it actually seems to make sense to do so because i did n't mention something in one post , does not mean that i 've never thought of it about it before i love hearing from readers and getting a variety of opinions ! but i do feel slightly insulted when people post comments telling me i must have never ever thought of socioeconomic factors , or that i must have never thought of the fact some families are single parent really ? i always feel bad when i get comments like that so please do bring up aspects that you feel might have been overlooked in a post , i just ask that if it 's something very obvious , like the fact that many people have a low income , you assume the best that i have considered it myself , so do n't approach it in a way that suggests i must have never thought of it ! when i say unschooling should be available to everyone , i think it 's important to note the should i also say that i believe every child is capable of being , and deserves to be , in control of their own education what i 've never said is that unschooling is currently available for every individual , because it 's not but instead of saying , as many seem to , that because it 's currently not available for every individual unschooling and freeschooling , is n't the answer not sure how that logic works , i simply see there being lots of work that needs to be done to make freedom based education available for all ! i feel like that 's what i'm working towards , both with local projects i'm involving myself in and i should point out that the local people working for educational freedom are very conscious of social factors and very involved in social justice work and the advocacy for unschooling that i do i see myself as part of a movement towards a far more egalitarian future , and since i think education is a very important part of that movement , and something i'm passionate about , that 's what i'm focusing on right now note that i say part of a movement towards an egalitarian future because i do n't talk much about my other social political views on this blog , perhaps it 's easy for people to forget about them , and maybe think that when i talk about universal unschooling i'm envisioning this exact same way of living , only with unschooling instead of school that could not be further from the truth i'm talking about entire social transformation , radical decentralization , autonomous communities , etc and within that framework , i see unschooling as naturally becoming the default and a good way of moving towards a different way of living is building creating as many positive alternatives to the current way of doing things as we can , i believe showing in as many ways as we can that other realities are possible and attainable i see unschooling and freeschooling as part of this also , i feel like i throw in the word freeschooling a lot , and i'm not even sure all of my readers know what that is , so i apologize for that , and do plan to write a post on it eventually the shortest and least complete answer i can give is that freeschooling is basically unschooling in a building , or close to it basically why i like mentioning it is because i see freeschooling as a great answer for families that are unable to stay home with their kids when they 're young , and for teens who really prefer to spend their days in a group environment i think it would be marvelous if there was a freeschool in every community ! i hope this clears up a few things , clarifies some of what i 've said in the past i always strive to be as clear in what i write on this blog as i can ! you might also like the need for schooling favorite unschooling posts on this blog of insecurities and an anniversary three years blogging and writing from the heart unschooling and freedom debate linkwithin
