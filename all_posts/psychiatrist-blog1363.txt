okay , so i'm not sure where to credit the idea for this post i read about the truman show delusion on the last psychiatrist blog , and it linked to a piece in the national post the story starts by discussing a paper in process by two psychiatrists who are brothers that in itself is weird enough and maybe someday i 'll know enough about it to blog about psychiatrist sibs i only know of one family where this actually exists the gold shrink brothers are interested in a phenomena they 've titled the truman show delusion it 's when a patient believes he is a character in a reality tv show when he is n't , obviously from the national post article while traditionalists insist that this delusion offers nothing new it is no different from , say , a deranged man who believes that the cia has planted a microchip in his tooth the gold brothers argue otherwise it 's really a question of the extent of the delusion , said joel gold , , who has been on staff at new york 's bellevue hospital center for eight years the delusions we typically treat are narrow there is capgras delusion , where someone will think his family has been replaced by doubles or the fregoli delusion , where someone believes that one person is persecuting him a doctor , mailman , butcher the truman show delusion , though , involves the entire world the last psychiatrist wants to discuss the delusion as a metaphor for maturity and fixation in adolescent developmental challenges okay i have n't examined the patients the gold shrink bros write about , and i 've never seen a patient with this particular delusional scheme , but in general , i 've found that delusional schemes happen apart from personality characteristics and developmental fixations in other words , i 've seen patients with grandiose delusional schemes who are n't otherwise narcissistic in their overall approach to the world , and i know plenty of self centered narcissistic folks who do n't seem to have any type of delusional disorders oh , i'm rambling , i just thought the idea of a truman show delusion was interesting and speaking of having one 's life broadcast to the public eye where oh where is roy today ?
