i had a dream two nights ago about a medical student who also happened to be a champion barbequer , or whatever the word would be his ribs were his specialty and had never been bested in competition people couldn t figure out what he put in his dry rub but they knew that they liked his ribs somehow , i became privy to his secret at night he would steal the ribs from cadavers from the gross anatomy class but he was facing two problems first , he was about to graduate and he was unsure where he could get ribs after he d moved on from medical school second , his ribs were becoming more and more popular and he was having trouble keeping up with demand because removing the embalming fluids was a very delicate and labor intensive process so , what does this mean ? what mysteries of my soul does this little dream unlock ? i doubt any other than the fact that i really like ribs with dry rub not too much salt and if it does i d rather not know what they are my approach to this depression thing is very simple i don t want to be depressed any more i don t care what started it i don t want to delve into my past and i certainly don t want to participate in any rebirthing therapy sessions i just want to feel better i am willing to do some self examination it wouldn t be possible to defeat depression without some reflection besides , it s just a good thing it s good to know who i am and what i want i just don t want to become a self absorbed naval gazer who looks for meaning in everything sometimes a cannibal is just a cannibal
