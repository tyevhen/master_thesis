so our psychiatric society now has a separate listserv just for cpt code issues not my idea and the cpt posts on both listservs are flying in what codes to use , what codes insurers are denying , what rates insurers are paying i'm not sure anything has caused such confusion and angst in recent years how 's it going for you ? my cpt youtube tutorials are still up if you 'd like to watch , but with so much speculation going on among the professionals , i do n't think anyone has any idea what we are supposed to be doing for one patient back in december , i requested pre authorization for psychotherapy with med management the old , i was sent authorization to see the patient for visits for minute visits and they said that i re submitted a uniform treatment plan asking for authorization for more reasonable codes , but just the idea ! so it 's been just about a month if you 're a patient , are you getting reimbursed ? if you 're a shrink are you getting paid ? i 'll ask again in a few weeks , but i'm assuming i 'll be filling out many repeat statements for patients to submit tell me your stories !
