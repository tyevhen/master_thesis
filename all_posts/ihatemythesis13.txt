back when i first quit my job to finish my thesis , the trees were bare and the women were covered it was february , a cold , dark and studious month if i 've ever heard of one yet even then , when the weather was on my side , i found it hard to study now the thermometer conspires against me it 's certainly that much harder to study when it seems like everybody else is having fun but hey , if you ca n't beat 'em , you can at least study by the pool , right ? no ? ok , well you can at least listen to today 's study anthem to imagine all the fun you 'll have post graduation ! i dreged this baby up from the funny facial hair days of the 's which leads me to ask , is there anything that youtube does n't have on file ? in the summertime by mungo jerry
