photo by mark grealish the last couple days i can feel my confidence dropping certain negative thoughts will arise and i find myself believing them rather than fighting them this may be one of my biggest downfalls , never content with myself , never feeling good enough , and not knowing how to change that another thing thats been bothering me lately i have been married for years next friday and i have been off birth control for about a year and a half we are living by the idea that if i get pregnant , thats great , if not , thats cool too just letting nature do its thing but lately the thought of actually being pregnant is very scary to me not so much the idea of having a child because i think that would be awesome not even so much of the labor and delivery but mostly i am panicky about the nine months of caring for this baby i worry that i wo n't be able to gain the needed weight to keep it healthy i worry that i will be prone to miscarriages and high risk pregnancies with my low weight i know that maybe i should wait until i am in a really good place anxiety wise but at the same time , its been over a year and i am surprised that it has n't happened yet we made plans years ago based on the idea that we would have already had children by now so i do n't want to put it off if its going to be really hard for me to have children i figure let nature take its course , and i will be able to handle it when it happens besides , is anyone ever really ready for that big step ? and maybe i will never be in a really good place with my anxiety maybe i just have to learn how to deal with anxiety and being pregnant just like i do for other triggers i am worried that i will be overly critical of myself if something were to go wrong i think i would feel like it was my fault , that i did n't eat the right things or take care of myself the way i should but then again everything could be perfectly fine so why worry about something that has n't even happened yet ? i tell myself these things and it makes sense but that does n't take the anxiety of it all away i got a really awesome raise a few weeks ago and lately i am feeling very unworthy of it i am hiring people that are definitely more technical than i am and that makes me feel a little bit worthless so i tell myself , just cause they are technical that does n't mean they would be a good leader or manager which is what i do but somehow that does n't balance the scales for me if i am honest i am really proud of what i have accomplished in my life i feel that i have an awesome career and i am making more money than i ever thought i could without a degree i have a home that we bought all by ourselves , i have a great marriage i should be really happy right ? its never enough its always so much easier to focus on the bad would a degree really make me feel all that better ? will i ever be technical enough ? will my body ever be good enough ? sorry for the pity party it 's the big mystery in my life how do you gain confidence in yourself ? if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety you might also like finding beauty in the storm celebrate ! traveling with anxiety trip they 're here traveling with anxiety trip linkwithin
