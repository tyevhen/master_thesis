all you have to do is lie down and feel it really i was reading arthur janov 's blog about mbct mindfulness whatever that is , and cognitive therapy just ignore patient 's history and treat the result of history , mix both and you have a new therapy really ? so we are going to talk forever about what ails us we are going to look at the crazy miserable person we have become we are going to talk about it for hours , days , months , years , try to understand it , forgive and move on really ? and we are never going to go to the origin of our behavior all these arcane reasons why we do what we do and how we become who we are our history all these minutes , hours , years of misery , of registering day after day that we did n't matter to the most important people in our lives , all theses instants when we needed a feeling of tenderness that told us we were ok , all these moments of silence when we needed them to be interested in us , their children , all these moments of utter despair for not being looked at with a smile , listened to with genuine interest , laughed with , accepted as a child human being , all these seconds of wretched pain for not being loved by the two most important people in our lives , day after day during all the years spent with them as we developed into adulthood and none of it mattered ? ? ? or we can ignore it for ever and just deal with the surface result ? ? ? so , the surface , who we are now , is n't the result of all these seconds of agony , of our need for love , of the agonizing pain for not being loved ? yes of course it is , but since it is all buried , covered , deeply entrenched in the past , let 's leave it there and not go back to it it is the past after all let 's deal with the present except for every pain has been buried , by and in our brain our physiology there is repression in and with every part of our bodies and we are n't going to feel it all this unconscious burying , rerouting , denying , which built us into who we are , the result of which is taken at face value and dealt with forever if we lived two thousands years it still would n't be enough to dig out every strand of the rerouting of the pain in our system , all the defenses being mostly unconscious that we had to erect in order to protect ourselves from the abject pain of not being loved so why bother , why even try ? to this day , i do n't even understand why people do n't see that and why they persist in wasting their time , their lives really , trying to figure out , talking about something they do n't have access to how can we understand something we really do n't remember ? intellectual understanding of buried feelings ! it would be funny , if it were n't not so tragic it is tragic , because we have only one life and we are going to spend it trying to figure out , trying to understand , trying to explain , trying to forgive what ? what we cannot figure out it is all buried , understand the millions of rerouted neurons in our brain , forgive our parents for not loving us etc but what about the rage and despair that they did n't love us , what about the impossible task to understand that they destroyed our real chance at our lives , the one and only one we have , and forgive yes , in most cases , it was n't their fault they were n't loved either yes we can still understand and forgive but so what ? what about the imprinted misery neurosis the rerouting of the pain into all theses automatic defenses mirrors inside mirrors , blocking our past , rerouting all our feelings and our thoughts , keeping us unaware of our original needs , our history , who we were , who we were supposed to become and who we became , unconscious , neurotic , lost , hurting , looking for something , always but looking for what ourselves ? ? this sounds like a tragedy , does n't it ? but the real tragedy is all this group of very important people , all these scholars representing a whole profession , parading onstage and telling the people , we are going to help you have a better life with mbct we have concocted a little cocktail of a bunch of theories , ideas of what ails you and we are going to fix you a little bit of this and of that if you talk enough , and understand enough , never mind the part that is unconscious your history we promise you luminous days , full of words , understanding and forgiveness and the tragedy is that all these poor lost souls , will believe it , buy it , go for it and lose their only chance at life yesterday i had a primal what is that ? feeling the hurt , the helplessness , the hopelessness of not being loved , the anger , the despair , the need to be loved by them , as a child i was in pain yesterday , so if i wanted to feel better i knew all i had to do was go lie down and feel it it and once again the miracle happened after hours of crying , becoming that hurt little girl again , being with them , looking at them as if they are with me now , talking to them , begging them to love me i understood new things , new strands of my life that have been pulling me forever in some unreal behavior , i understood a new piece of why all my life why all my life , again , another huge piece why i have been who i am , why i react in this way each time , why i get hurt so easily , why i could never do this , why i always did that , why i could n't love , why i pushed love away , why i could n't feel good , why i did n't sleep well , why life was miserable and so why i did n't care about it , why the sun on my skin left me indifferent , why beauty did n't touch me , why others misery did n't mobilize me , why , why , why my life could be so meaningless at times , , why and it is so incredibly simple really today as i am writing this , i marvel at the miracle it is i can go back there , not in thoughts , not by some exercise , not by talking a pill or chanting but having access whenever i want i can go back there , go back to the moments , the images , the sensations , the memories , the needs , the despair that little girl felt it is all there , buried in me all i have to do is let myself feel it i still marvel at how my brain , my body have kept pristine , alive and real , all these instants where i felt i was n't loved , how the memory of each second was buried but stayed in me how i had to not to feel it to be be able to go on , and so repress this unacceptable fact that the people who should have loved me most , nurture the best part of me , whose love should have made me grow , develop , allow me to feel joy and warmth , feel that all was well in this world , didn't who i was ? tragedy my one life , miserable , drugs , drinking , failed relationship , successful , so what ? a life that belonged to someone else literally so why live suicide attempt five minutes later over no , a reprieve , new york , a book we are creatures of need i have needs ? i should have been loved ? it is not all my fault ? they just could n't ? i am not bad , doomed , crazy forever i can kiss my psychoanalyst good bye ? there are no reason for anything and certainly , no more reason to try to follow the myriad of ways i have been rerouting all this pain that made me a stranger to myself ? you mean it is possible to undo all this misery , not to be stuck in my past forever ? you mean i can have a life , my life ? it is all in a book i will know who i am , i will be whom i really am , i will feel good , i will sleep well , i will be able to love really and may be to be loved i will be able to feel my life in the present because the past will be gone , i will remember it but it wo n't pull the strings all the time i will be free from it enfin , at last ? you mean , it is possible ? i left my job , my car in a street in paris , left my key with a friend , flew to los angeles and yes it is possible it all happened and it is even better that i could have imagined when i hurt , the past is always more powerful than the hurt in the present , so all i have to do is lie down and feel it each time , i go back there , that little piece of me , repressed , buried , comes alive , i feel what happened , i become that little girl hurt again , i understand one more piece of who i am i come out of this incredible trip in the past , and then i am completely in the present light , happy , alive , myself at last i still marvel at the fact that once i feel that old pain , my old needs , all the different ways i unconsciously denied them , avoided them , all this tortuous behavior to keep them away , all becomes clear how my unconscious becomes conscious , and how i know now and forever who i was , and who i had to become , and now finally who i am and i want to thank the man who figured it all and put it in a book i thank him for my life forever so what i do n't understand is why would anybody want to waste their life doing what is it called mbct ?
