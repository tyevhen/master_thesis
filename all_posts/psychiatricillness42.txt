i'm feeling much more stable at the moment i stopped taking the aripiprazole for a while and after a while i stoppedthe sertraline too i am not sure why i did it the best explanation i can think of is i was frightened of the little blue tablets they caused me to have some unpleasant side effects and i felt my concentration was very poor i blamed the tablets for me getting behind at work anyway about weeks later i went to the us for work when i got back i sleptfor nearly a week i went to see my psychiatrist to tell him i had stopped taking the tablets and heconvincedme to go back on a reduced dose he assureed me the sideeffects were due to an interaction between aripirazole and quetiapine and should not come back now i have completely stopped the quetiapine i am now on a lower dose of aripiprazole just mg and back on mg of sertraline i have changed the timing of the sertraline to take mg all at the same timerather than mg morningand night i kept forgetting the morning dose before i am feeling much better and back in control these days i hope it lasts work is much better too i have a more manageable worklod and a new boss i have also moved desks so i have peple cose by who i can talk to i am getting out more and socialisingso things are really on the up my friend had a new baby last week so i off to visit them this afteroon ! i must do some housework first tho'
