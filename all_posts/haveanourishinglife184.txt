one of the side effects of taking an anti depressant is weird , vivid dreams last night i dreamt that i could not run around the school track , even one time the scene at the track was the most normal part of the whole dream i won t tell you what was so weird about it anyway , back to not being able to run after my marathon , i took some time off from running in order to heal properly i was having some trouble with my foot and my knees you see , i want to run until i am years old , so i am in it for the long haul i don t want to ruin my knees to the point that i won t be able to run anymore instead of doing other forms of exercise , like i thought i would this winter , i really haven t been exercising at all in one sense , it has been good for me to detach my self esteem from how much i work out even if i don t work out at all , i am still worthy and deserving of life i guess my goal this winter was to exercise to enhance my life instead of exercising as a required punishment so , my subconscious is still worried about becoming out of shape , hence the dream it was a terrible dream i had no muscle power whatsoever that is a scary feeling the experience made me realize that i still want to be strong not obsessive body building strong , but strong enough to keep up with little kids at the park , strong enough to run a road race in the summer , and strong enough to lift a big pot of chili for a cook off i had an aha moment after i shook all the fuzziness out of my brain this morning i still want to exercise to be strong our culture does not require us to use our muscles as they had to in the olden days in order to survive so , in order to use some of those muscles , we have to go out of our way i thought about it for a long time it was part of my hard core staring out the window this morning in order to keep my muscles strong , i have to go out of my way how much am i willing to go out of my way to be strong ? how can i keep it in check and not get obsessive ? how can i avoid allowing weight and appearance to get all tangled up with exercise ? keep in mind that i fall in the exercise obsessive end of the spectrum i do not need more motivation when it comes to working out well , i don t know the answer i feel like keeping a positive body image will be something i will always struggle with but there are things that i can do to help myself out for starters , i think it is good for me to take frequent exercise breaks not just breaks throughout the week , but also long breaks , like taking a winter off from running the winter , at least in ohio , is an obvious time for hibernation it is too cold to be outside most days , well , too cold to run and enjoy it , for me , at least the winter is a good time to take a step back and separate my self importance from my appearance and weight the bottom line is i exercise a lot because that is how i validate my self worth i have to remind myself that i don t need to run to be happy running makes me happy , that is very true , but it is not the only thing that makes me happy this winter , i taught myself how to knit and crochet from youtube videos it was such a uniquely entertaining experience i never thought i would have been able to learn something new on my own i probably wouldn t have even tried to learn if i was too concerned about getting a workout in every single day so , yes , i had a weird dream , and i hope i forget about all the details soon but , i am glad that a good reflection came from it just because i took the winter off from running doesn t mean i will never be able to run again it will be hard to get back into it in the beginning of the spring , of course but i know i that i can do it i know that i will at least try and even if i can t run anymore , it is not the end of the world i will find some other form of exercise that i like to do do you feel like a failure if you don t exercise ? do you tie your self worth to your workouts ? where and when did that belief begin ?
