i'm back in the hospital the plan is to stay here and stabilize , get some of my intrusive thoughts settled , and then go home before i start transcranial magnetic stimulation tms treatments early next week i hate being locked up in here again , especially so soon after my last significant depression episode intellectually i know i 'd be doing well if not for my back injury , surgery , and recovery limitations but that does n't seem to help me feel less disappointed to require hospitalization again fortunately i have very smart friends to remind me i'm sick this is an illness , and sometimes i need more intensive help as she drove me to the front door , my friend heidi reminded me , if i had a cancer relapse i 'd go to the hospital without question or fight she 's right i need to quit fighting the cure and fight the illness instead i guess this is my time to do just that
