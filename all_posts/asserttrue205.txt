it 's common practice , when a patient complains of not seeing improvement on antidepressants , for the clinician to increase the dose of whatever the patient is taking , on the theory that everyone 's metabolism is slightly different , and what may be a therapeutic dose for one person may not be strong enough for someone else there is no scientific basis for upping the dose of antidepressants , however , since almost all antidepressants have a flat dose response curve if your clinician is playing around with doses , you 're dealing with someone who has n't read the literature the literature says dose does n't matter patricia berney of the unit de psychopharmacologie clinique , h pitaux universitaires de gen ve , ch ne bourg , switzerland , did a literature survey on antidepressants and doses , published in dialogues in clinical neuroscience sep her conclusion the results show that a flat dose response curve is a class phenomenon for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris , according to randomized , controlled , fixed dose clinical trials it 's worth pulling some quotations directly from her analysis of the literature for celexa , she found the short term studies with citalopram did not show significant differences when using change on the hamd and madrs total score , citalopram and mg day were no different from placebo for lexapro , she found the only fixed dose response study with escitalopram indicates that mg day was equally as effective as mg day for prozac the studies with fluoxetine did not show significant differences in terms of clinical efficacy across a dose range of to mg day therefore , for the majority of patients , there is no advantage of increasing the dose of fluoxetine above mg day it might even be the case that the higher dose of mg day is less effective in major depressive disorder also the study by dornseif et al was performed more than years ago it is of great importance because it demonstrated that there is no advantage of tripling the dose of fluoxetine to mg day in outpatients who fail to initially respond to mg day for weeks during the next weeks , patients in both groups responded to the same extent and at the same rate for luvox significant differences were not seen between fluvoxamine , , or mg day or placebo for paxil in the publication by dunner and dunbar table i , there is a short description of a study involving patients the paroxetine mg day dose was no more effective than placebo , even on the hamd depressed mood item the authors reported also on a pooled analysis from a worldwide database , involving patients who remained on a fixed dose of paroxetine or placebo for at least weeks , which showed no differences in terms of clinical efficacy across a dose range of to mg day paroxetine therefore , for the majority of patients , there is no advantage in increasing the dose of paroxetine above mg day for zoloft the ssri sertraline did not show significant differences in terms of clinical efficacy across a dose range of to mg day , according to a major study by fabre and putman table i therefore , for the majority of patients , there is no advantage to increase the dose of sertraline above mg day for the tetracyclic antidepressant maprotiline , otherwise known as deprilept , ludiomil , or psymion , versus paxil the study by benkert et al used the same protocol as dornseif et al and schweizer et al and evaluated two antidepressants , paroxetine and maprotiline this study could not demonstrate an advantage of doubling the dose of paroxetine to mg day in patients who had failed to respond initially to mg day for weeks in another group of patients not included in table iv , no advantage of increasing the dosage of maprotiline to mg day in patients who had failed to respond initially to mg day for weeks could be demonstrated no significant benefits of dose escalation were found for savella , dalcipran , toledomin the ssri milnacipran , commonly prescribed for fibromyalgia in the study by guelfi et al , milnacipran was prescribed at doses of and mg day , with a third group receiving fluoxetine mg day at the end of weeks , there were no differences between the three groups on change on the hamd items and madrs total scores on ittlocf ultimately , berney said our review of eight clinical trials at fixed doses that have evaluated the dose response relationship of ssris in the treatment of major depressive disorders suggests that the dose response curve is flat moreover , three augmentation studies could not demonstrate an advantage of doubling the dose of paroxetine , or tripling the dose of fluoxetine , in patients who had failed to respond initially to mg day for weeks table iv there was a heterogeneity of the results in that some studies did not show a significant difference between the active substance and placebo , or between the highest dosage and placebo if you read berney 's report carefully , she mentions a number of side effects for which dose response relationships were , indeed , noted thus , these are drugs for which the primary clinical effect relief from depression shows no dose response curve , whereas side effects do show a dose response curve lack of a dose response relationship is , of course , typical for placebos berney 's results are consistent with a separate meta analysis by baker et al , evidence that the ssri dose response in treating major depression should be reassessed , depression and anxiety , , it 's also the conclusion reached in yet another meta analysis by hansen et al , med decision making january february , said the hansen group dose was not a statistically significant predictor of categorical ham d response among comparative trials with nonequivalent doses , trends favored higher dose categories but generally were not statistically significant these results are consistent with a hypothesis that antidepressants of the types listed above are , in fact , basically nothing more than fancy placebos many antidepressants fail to perform better than placebo in efficacy testing , and just like a placebo they have no discernible dose response curve if your clinician has been playing around with doses , you 're both wasting your time a placebo is a placebo is a placebo dose does n't matter i'm writing a no bullshit , word book on mental illness
