this is one of those weeks in which i feel i was running around like a chicken with my head cut off , yet there 's nothing much to say about it in my update ! with my new job with strange hours ramping up , i feel over committed to family , friends , and volunteer work so that i have very little free time for myself i ended up having to borrow free time , missing two events last week but i 've now rearranged certain aspects of my schedule hopefully that will help i am sadly behind on my book reviews , but i have penciled into my calendar to write a review for the ear , the eye , and the arm on tuesday and why zebras do n't have ulcers on thursday we 'll see if proactively planning my reviews gets me caught up ! the activity my blog has seen this week is that i decided to organize a full bible group read through the year i already have a group interested on librarything , if you prefer that venue or if you would like to casually or all out join me reading blogging about the bible next year , let me know ! this week i completed to kill a mockingbird , and i loved it though the ending made me laugh because it reminded me of when my mom told me i did n't understand that book when i got to the ending i understood why lol mom so literal in light of my new plan to read the bible , i decided to read some preparatory non fiction i 've temporarily set aside the myth of sisyphus , which i started last week also , the fifth child won last week 's vote , so that 's what i 'll be reading for halloween this week i'm reading how to read the bible , by james l kugel , stiletto , by daniel o'malley , and harry potter and the chamber of secrets , by j k rowling i'm linking this post back to the sunday salon on facebook and caffeinated reviewer 's sunday post oh , and oh , so cute , i found this loving life meme too check it out ! what i love about life today is my friend charity , whom i have n't seen in months got to see her last night as a surprise hang out
