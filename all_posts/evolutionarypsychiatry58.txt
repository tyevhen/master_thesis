zz ward put the gun down right click to open in new window , ad at the beginning , my apologies , but song is rad i have n't done much on ocd for this blog , which is silly i mean , ask any psychiatrist about organic mental health disorders and ocd will top the list it is highly inherited , and there are forms of it that , like rheumatic heart disease , even start after a bacterial infection is ocd an autoimmune disease ? a fair question ocd by definition obsessive compulsive disorder ocd is an anxiety disorder characterized by unreasonable thoughts and fears obsessions that lead you to do repetitive behaviors compulsions with obsessive compulsive disorder , you may realize that your obsessions are n't reasonable , and you may try to ignore them or stop them but that only increases your distress and anxiety ultimately , you feel driven to perform compulsive acts in an effort to ease your stressful feelings clinical ocd is not the same as just liking all your stuff neat or writing notes in rainbow order with colored pens ocd is a terrible burden it means an hour long shower just so everything is done in the right order countless hidden routines and intrusive thoughts nasty , negative , sexual or homicidal intrisive thoughts that are so far from who you are that you are tortured by them the disorder tends to start in childhood , so it becomes a part of who the person is there are certain cases of ocd that begin with a strep infection these are thought to be due to pandas pediatric autoimmine neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus infection many childhood cases of ocd involve tics and other movement disorders as well david sedaris has a personal take on the experience pandas strike with obsessive compulsions and tics , also increased urinary incontinence , hyperactivity , and a deterioration in handwriting the strep autoantibodies seem to be attacking the basal ganglia straight up non pandas ocd does n't seem to have these characreristics so not every case of ocd is a panda classic therapy for ocd involves behavior therapy and ssris and i have patients with ocd on clean paleo diets who still need ssris for symptom remission a rather famous paleo character from robb wolf 's site , squatchy or chris williams came forward to me with his history of ocd he said i could share his story it was horrible for him he tried doctors , pharmaceticals , everything , for years managing his lifestyle for good sleep and exercise and a paleo diet has helped him tremendously it would make sense from a pathologic standpoint that some cases might have inflammatory dietary components that , if removed , would diminish the symptoms of ocd this fact will not be true for all cases in chris' case , multiple factors were at play i started having problems with ocd , and tourette 's in about st grade it would get especially bad during the summer i was miserable , going to bed as early as possible so i would n't have to be awake , not wanting to be alive , etc i had good number and bad numbers , and even some good and bad words , and would have to touch everything a certain number of times , usually while thinking certain thoughts when i did so at times i even had to have some people around me , like my mom , do things a certain number of times , or say a certain word a specific number of times to say that all of this was incredibly annoying would be a severe understatement with the tourette 's i had head tics where i would nod my head forward quickly , vocal tics where i would make a sound that i could feel in the back of my throat , blinking , etc after some time i ended up transitioning into a paleo diet from my previous healthy diet eventually i also stopped running as much , and started doing more strength and hiit work i noticed after a while that my ocd seemed to be a lot less prevalent than it used to eventually it got the point where it was n't even noticeable most of the time i would go through the day , touching things , closing doors , turning off light switches , and not even have ocd type thoughts now i would say it 's not a problem or even something i do most of the time in times of stress or if i'm more worried about something in particular , i notice a few ocd thoughts coming back here and there , but even then it 's less than it used to be at baseline more about the pathology of ocd in the next article
