as i mentioned in my yes you can article , i am reading an interesting book it is heroes for my son by brad meltzer copyright by forty four steps , inc all rights reserved sharing is permitted i receive a chapter every day from dailylit i am about two thirds the way through the book there have been so many inspirational stories that just tug at your heart and every one of them delivers a great message i am just amazed at some of the stories even more interesting is the background story for each selected hero i might know the name and the accomplishment , but most of the time i am not aware of what prompted the unselfish or great accomplishment how often do you find yourself saying something like , i wish i could do something about that ? we see animals covered in oil in the gulf or children starving in haiti you know the drill the sight just makes you want to do something to help then you ask yourself , but what ? i know i have been there many times and , unfortunately , after a few days i forget about it , or at best , give a donation what made the author , brad meltzer , choose these particular people as heroes , however , is that they all did something about it not just wish or write a check they made a difference today 's hero was dan west have you ever heard about him before ? not me , but after reading his abbreviated short story , i wanted to know more mr west is the founder of heifer international yes , i remember the name , but nothing more the story starts with a brief summary , after seeing the devastation brought about by the spanish civil war in the late s , indiana farmer dan west began sending livestock across the world to the poor and malnourished his project continued , growing from his small idea to become heifer international as a relief worker in the spanish civil war , dan had to choose who would go hungry each day because there was not enough powdered milk to feed everyone every day he saw the same starving children dan west looked at these starving children and compared them to his daughters back home they were well fed and healthy because their indiana farm was fairly self sufficient the adage , give a man a fish and you have fed him for today , but teach the man to fish and you have fed him for a lifetime , applies well to this story that is what dan did he gave the people cows , not just a cup of milk he started by sending seventeen cows to malnourished children in puerto rico after world war ii , more cows were sent to europe and japan as you know , everything has a catch and so did dan 's program he did not just give the cows away he made every family that received his cows promise that when each animal gave birth , the newborn animal had to go to another family he felt in this way the gift would keep on giving and help many more people that needed food dan west saw there was a need and did something about it it all started with seventeen cows , but today heifer international has fed over million people in countries at the end of every chapter , there is always one quote from the hero being profiled in all my travels around the world , the important decisions were made where people sat in a circle , facing each other as equals , dan west what a great story ! note unfortunately , in recent years there have been several scams going around using heifer international 's name it just goes to show that for every good deed , there is usually someone else standing just around the corner trying to take advantage of our generosity
