when i feel anxious , sometimes it seems the world stops you probably know the feeling i zero in on my symptoms such as blurry vision , heart palpitations , and tightness in the chest the more i think about my symptoms , the worse they become sometimes it 's hard to think of anything else which , of course , is how we get into trouble we look for ways for instant relief for people with ocd tendencies , this might mean performing a ritual for others , it might be escaping from the distressing situation either way , we do ourselves much more harm than good by not muddling through whatever troubles us for example , say you 're having a problem with doing something at work you might think you are making many mistakes , but that 's not likely the reality dr low called this thought process romanto intellectualism basically , believing that if you think it or feel it , it must be real such an attitude distorts reality for nervous people in actuality , what we think or feel usually does not reflect the true situation dr low reminds us that it is not how we feel but how we function , and in most cases we perform just fine no matter how distressing the feelings or sensations and , using this example , if you did make a mistake , better to have the courage to make a mistake than succumb to a vicious cycle of anxiety after all , making mistakes is average , and we should not focus on being exceptional true recovery comes to those who wait and practice with patience although we want instant relief , that 's not realistic for boosting our long term mental health letting go of our fears and being realistic is part of what recovery is all about
