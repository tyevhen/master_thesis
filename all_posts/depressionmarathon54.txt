i discovered one thing as a result of my recent back injury if i did n't advocate , and advocate strongly , for myself , nobody else would have , and my care would suffer i do n't want to get into all the specifics here i already delineated how inaccurate my hospital discharge summary and mri reports were in a previous post unfortunately , most of my follow up appointments were preceded by the treatment providers reading those inaccurate reports i ended up one step in the hole prior to the provider even saying hello they approached me thinking they already knew my story , and in a few cases actually tried to make my symptoms match what they read rather than looking at me objectively i felt very fortunate to be a physical therapist , as i knew what the treatment provider should have been looking at as a result , i had to advocate , and advocate strongly , for myself the trick to being my own advocate , i'm learning , is gentle , factual , and very politically correct pressure i spent the weekend reviewing my available records thank god for online medical records , and composing written messages to different providers as a result i got one specialist appointment moved up a week , got some paperwork i needed for my employer completed , and had one procedure considered which was previously deemed unnecessary oh , and prior to the weekend , through a series of messages and phone calls , i got my mri report amended so it now accurately describes my injury it was an exhausting , tense process , but it was worth it i'm relieved i'm really glad i took the initiative to be my own advocate i'm glad i have knowledge of the human body and of neurological testing and i'm grateful i have just enough communication skills to effectively communicate with each provider , presenting my case without offending or angering any of them interestingly , this is exactly the kind of energy and impetus i do not have during a depression relapse i feel like my treatment plan is now thorough and heading in the right direction as a patient , i rely on my caregivers to be skilled , thorough , and nonjudgmental i feel for patients who do not have access to some of the knowledge and resources i had during this process how do they assure effective treatment for themselves ? as a healthcare provider , i'm frustrated by the presumptions , incomplete examinations , and mistakes i experienced throughout this process i understand how some of that happens , but it happened entirely too often during my hospitalization and follow up appointments that is disheartening i guess the lesson is we all have to be patient advocates we have to be patient patients yet be unafraid to speak up , gently but decisively , when we feel more needs to be done if we do n't stand up for ourselves , who will ? lesson learned
