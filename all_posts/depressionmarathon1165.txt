big news ! ! puck 's running again ! he 's had trouble gaining full flexion in his reconstructed knee , which means he 's also had trouble re building the muscles in that leg last week , i thought he 'd finally gained enough muscle from consistent swimming that he 'd be able to handle running again he was sooooo excited when i grabbed his leash ! i could feel him smiling the entire run he was especially happy to see all the squirrels were still scampering about the neighborhood ! now , if only mom would let go of the damn leash just for a second ! we 've run together times he 's not in the shape either of us are used to , so i'm limiting him to miles for now he gets pooped , but his leg seems to be holding up just fine he 's happy i'm happy it 's so nice to be running with my boy again i am forever grateful for my vet 's skillful intervention i am grateful puck is able to resume living the life he was accustomed to living and i am grateful to all of you for your encouragement , prayers and support thank you thank you thank you
