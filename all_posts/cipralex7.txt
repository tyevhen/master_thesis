hello my friends , first of all i m truly sorry for the delay , i was busy up to my neck in all the wedding arrangements , work and my personal to do list i ve also got some bad news seems like we ve lost the baby after couple of weeks the doctors say it s a natural abortion and that sometimes it happens for unknown reasons so we will try again soon enough , but that meant that besides work , life and the wedding i also had to deal with this which was not that pleasant but i must say i kept my coolness and focus and we ve passed it ok i think my fianc was really proud of the way i handled it the wedding is approaching , mean while i don t feel too nervous about it , at least nothing i cant handle , i still take the mg cipralex and over all things are good however a thought came to my mind to increase the dosage to or just for the wedding day , it s still a lot of pressure , but i m not sure about that , would love to hear what you guys think wow , i need to read a lot of comments now take care will post more soon email this blogthis ! share to twitter share to facebook reactions
