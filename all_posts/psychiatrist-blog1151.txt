oh , not really , i'm almost never at a loss for words but this is the thing for three years now i go through my days and when i see or hear something interesting , i think i'm going to blog about that ! or i think , oh , i wish i could blog about that but i ca n't because it would reveal something about a patient so i get lots of ideas , but then i get to the computer and sometimes i 've forgotten them last night , i was with clink and roy and we were having an animated hmmm , is that the right word ? discussion about richard the internet porn fan a fictional patient in our book when one of them said something totally random and i thought what a great blog post title what ever it was , it was pretty random , but i wanted to use it , and it was gone neither of them remembered what they 'd said sometimes , i make notes about ideas i 've gotten , but and i'm twittering now half heartedly roy 's been asking me to follow him , so i started actually , i'm a total failure someone has un followed me for being snarky about twitter i do n't really get it , and being limited to characters is my idea of suffocation plus , it 's not like a blog were everyone has access to the same info i twitter about someone 's tweet and then realize he does n't follow me , i just follow him or someone else responds to a tweet i never read and there 's really not so much to say in short bursts but during dinner last night , we had a lengthy discussion on cremation and the interesting disposal of ashes one friend helped scatter his uncle on the th hole where uncle had gotten holes in one ! and i twittered that the temperature used for cremation is , degrees , per clinkshrink why does she know all these random things my brain needs more coffee
