for those of you who have kept up to date with my twitter , you 'll know that i worked in a charity shop over the summer i also did a weeks work experience in a law firm , which i will go into more detail later working in a shop was something i never thought i would do once upon a time , i got severe panic attacks any time that i went into a shop and asked for a job or i just could n't step foot into the shop to ask my body just froze but , as of recently i have grown in confidence and applied to work in the charity shop working in the shop has grown my confidence with the tasks i had to complete including serving customers , sorting out donations and organising displays i finally felt that the time had come that i felt comfortable enough to be able to control my anxiety to an extent to which was manageable it turns out that after years of panicking , i was calm and collected when applying and when working there taking everything in my stride i am proud of how far i have come in terms of my job anxiety , and i hope to continue through the stages and get a paid job next year it is completely out of my comfort zone , but i knew it was something i needed to do and i am glad and proud that i have what other people are doing at my age is not for me to compare although many of my peers have had jobs for years , they may not have dealt with the severity of a mental illness therefore if you do n't feel ready yet , that is okay you are on your own journey let 's keep kicking the anxiety ! , amy xx
