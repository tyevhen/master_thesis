there comes a time in any dating relationship when you and the person you 're dating decide if you 're going to take it to the next level making a commitment to be in a monogamous relationship or deciding that you 're not going to pursue a serious relationship are you dating someone who has problems making a commitment to a relationship ? under ideal circumstances , you and your dating partner talk about it and mutually agree either that you 're going to be in a relationship , you 're going to remain in a casual dating situation or you 're going to stop seeing each other but , often , both people do n't see eye to eye about it one person might want to remain casual while the other might want to be in a more committed relationship this can put an emotional strain on each of you as you try to work out this situation if you 're the person who wants a committed relationship and your dating partner wants to remain in a non monogamous dating situation , what do you do ? of course , there are no easy answers and it depends on many factors for instance , if the two of you have been dating for a year and you 're a woman in your late s who wants to have children soon , you might have different feelings about it compared to a woman in her early s who is not in a hurry to have children and , if you 're dating partner has a long history of avoiding making commitments to relationships , you would probably want to consider this if it has been a lifelong pattern it can be a very hurtful situation to discover that you 've fallen in love with someone and you want to take your relationship to the next level , but your dating partner is ambivalent you might decide to give the situation more time are you dating someone who has problems making a commitment to a relationship ? but if you 're someone who wants to get married and have children one day or you just want to settle down with one person , you 'll want to ask yourself some hard questions about how long you want to wait to see if the person you love wants to make a commitment to you how long are you willing to wait and what is the downside of waiting ? will it be eroding to your sense of self ? will there be increasing pressure and tension between the two of you ? are you being honest with yourself about this person and if you 're both suited for each other ? are you allowing the head over heels feeling of being in love blind you to certain problems between you ? are you staying with this person because you 're too afraid to be alone ? are you afraid you wo n't meet anyone else ? these are tough but necessary questions to confront i think many people know deep down when it 's time to end a dating relationship with someone who has problems making a commitment , but they often do n't want to break up because they do n't want to go through the heartache what 's even more heartbreaking is to look back on time that has passed and realize that , all along , the person you 're dating would never be able to make a romantic commitment no matter how long you wait if you 're in a dating relationship with someone who has problems with making a commitment , you owe it to yourself to be honest about your feelings with yourself and your dating partner you have a right to be happy and so does your dating partner you might feel that you wo n't be able to tolerate the loss , but most people are a lot more resilient than they realize and they overcome these losses i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist i work with individual adults and couples to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at also , see my article dating vs being in a relationship
