i 'd like to thank clinking by proxy for helping me post while my comcast was down i owe you chocolate and yes , dinah , i 'll babysit max he 's adorable i used to think that i would n't write about substance abuse because i was n't an official substance abuse expert , at least not on paper i did n't do an addictions fellowship and addiction per se was not usually the primary focus of treatment in my outpatient clinic then came my dose dependent post and the benzo wars podcast and all the subsequent comments , positive and negative , about the issue i discovered i had a lot to say , mainly as a result of several years of direct practical experience many doctors , as a rule , do not like patients with substance abuse problems they fill up the emergency room , they suck down psychiatric resources , they fill up the psychiatric inpatient beds looking for detox or housing , they fill up the inpatient medical wards with conditions resulting from their lifestyles they take a lot of time and work and they 're not always nice people to deal with those are the folks with the severe addictions , the ones that result in arrest and incarceration or homelessness and poverty there are lots of other addicts out there whom i never see , the middle class non criminal addicts whose addiction touches the lives of their families and loved ones but never quite sinks to the level of the streets these addictions are no less serious i think i get vocal about these folks and about things like prescription controlled substances because i can see where things are headed i know how bad they can get and the human wreckage that will be left along the way i can tell you story after story about people who have never done a thing wrong in their lives until that on the job accident and the first opiate prescription , or that first hit of cocaine or the first benzo prescription and the next thing you know the wife is gone , the job is gone , the house is gone , and they 're in prison it does happen , more often than you think doctors ca n't always tell who is or is n't an addict among these nice , educated , relatively well heeled genteel non criminal folks addiction is a hidden disease , a disease of denial , a thing that 's carried in secret and buried away even from the addict addicts can hide their problems even from people living in the same household shame is a powerful motivation for secrecy doctors are n't soothsayers or mind readers , and taking a good history or talking to relatives wo n't always turn up the problem prior to writing a prescription we want to care for people and relieve distress and a prescription is one way to do that unfortunately , it is also possible to create a new addiction in a person who never had one before and we have no way of knowing ahead of time which patient this will happen to giving a warning about addiction potential or cautions about continuous use is one way of approaching this problem , thus leaving the responsibility for the addiction back with the patient i warned you this could happen , i have it documented in the informed consent section of my progress note but this would be little comfort to me when i see these folks in prison when i read comments from people who say they 're reluctant to take more of their prescribed controlled substance , i say respect your gut if you think it may be a problem for you , it could be if your loved ones or doctor is encouraging you to take more and you 're not comfortable with that , say so repeatedly if necessary you 're the one carrying both the symptoms and the addiction risk as one of our anonymous commenters said we did n't wake up one day addicted it was one or more of your colleagues with an md after their name who started all of this for the vast majority of us so as someone else said , why do n't you take it up with them at your conferences or in professional writings or wherever it is that you all gather to talk down about us and the problem your crew created ? that 's exactly why we 're blogging and podcasting about this thank you
