this last year i wrote a couple of articles about my new wheelchair my permobil c is great and has made life much easier for me the seat lift is wonderful and makes transferring to other chairs effortless and worry free last week , however , i discovered a new use for the seat i was in the office sitting in my desk chair working on the new kda website the chair height is a little less than needed , so i use a cushion to raise it a few more inches the chair is also on wheels and this normally does not create a problem this morning , however , i was not feeling quite as strong and when i pushed off with my arms and leaned forward , the chair slid backwards i could not catch myself and ended up sitting on the floor i tried getting up , but just did not have the strength my wife was gone for the day and my options were limited i was wearing myself down quickly trying different positions and angles if i did not come up with a solution soon , i would have to dial h for help i e , call a neighbor or friend who was available as i sat there considering what else to try i looked at my wheelchair and thought , what if i crawled over to the chair and lowered the seat i then moved a folding chair so that it was near the front of the wheelchair i laid my upper torso on the wheelchair seat and pushed the up button walla ! my body rose up and up and up i reached behind , pulled the folding chair closer , and leaned back eureka ! i was sitting comfortably on the chair and could get up without a problem afterward as i wiped down the permobil , i muttered sweet nothings to it it seemed to sense how i was feeling the whirl and hum of the electric motors seemed to say it was pleased with itself mission accomplished !
