yesterday i had the pleasure of watching a klingon christmas carol performed at the historic mounds theatre in saint paul in case you 're wondering yup , that 's a thing it is the first play written and performed in klingon preceding the klingon shakespeare plays the playwrights are christopher kidder mostrom and sasha warren its translation into english , shown on a screen behind the actors , was by sasha warren squja' is a cowardly money lender who not only refuses to take place in the yearly warrior festival of kahless , refuses to donate money for orphans to be trained as warriors , and forces his assistant to work so much that he is unable to train his crippled son timhom to spar but on the eve of kahless , his friend marli' , who is as dead as a red shirt appears to squja' to warn him that he will be visited by three spirit warriors on this evening the spirit of khaless past , present , and future visit him and at the end of the night squja' has gained courage to become a generous and brave warrior himself the play was quite funny and well performed by our local klingons here in the twin cities the only thing that struck me as a little off was that marli' was as dead as a red shirt but appeared as a doorknob , like marlee of the dickens story if you remember he was as dead as a doorknob marli' should have appeared as a red shirt
