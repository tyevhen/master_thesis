very few drugs can be shown , convincingly , to be associated with a definite reduction in suicide rate people have tried to show this for antidepressants , but it is n't an easy connection to demonstrate to my knowledge , only two drugs seem to show a consistent connection with reduced suicide rate lithium widely prescribed for bipolar disorder and caffeine lithium 's tendency to prevent suicide in high risk groups like bipolar patients is fairly well known , and the literature on this is extensive i 'll save that discussion for another time or you can refer to the mania chapter in the book i'm writing on mental illness the results for caffeine are correlational they do not prove cause and effect still , the evidence is intriguing in , michel lucas et al published a study in jama internal medicine that looked at , u s women mean age years who were free of depressive symptoms at baseline in , then prospectively followed up through june , during years of follow up , , incident cases of depression were identified the researchers went back over the data for coffee consumption they found that depression risk decreases with increasing caffeinated coffee consumption what 's more , they found a clear dose response relationship the relative risk was confidence interval , for those consuming to cups per day and p for trend for those consuming cups per day or more in plain english , that means a risk reduction of for drinkers of to cups of coffee per day and risk reduction for those drinking more than that lucas followed up two years later with an expanded study that looked specifically at suicide risk among coffee drinkers in this study , lucas et al analyzed data for , men and , women , covering a period of years for men to years for women , and found a strong dose dependent inverse association between coffee consumption and suicide , with the risk of suicide reduced for drinkers of to cups per day and reduced for drinkers of more than cups of coffee a day the researchers corrected for a variety of potential confounding factors , including smoking , antidepressant use , alcohol consumption , age , gender , and marital status read the study to get the full discussion neither tea nor decaffeinated coffee conferred any risk reduction the lucas results confirm two earlier studies a study showed lower suicide risk among coffee drinkers in a longitudinal investigation of over , individuals who were followed for an average of years klatsky et al suicide risk decreased monotonically with increasing coffee consumption , and was lower in drinkers of six cups of coffee per day as compared to non coffee drinkers likewise , a study involving , female nurses found suicide risk was lower among women who drank four cups of caffeinated coffee per day as compared to non drinkers during the first years of follow up kawachi et al before you get too excited , bear in mind that a research team in finland found , in , that suicide risk is greater in people who drink eight cups or more of coffee per day one can hypothesize that agitation , anxiety , and impulsivity all of which are likelier if you ingest too much caffeine may be important effects here but there are other possible explanations , including the likelihood that people who feel the need to self medicate with cups of coffee a day are probably at high risk for suicide for other reasons certainly , the evidence is abundant that substance abuse , depression , and suicide are closely linked perhaps in a future edition of the dsm we 'll see a coffee use disorder diagnosis for people who drink cups a day the studies are n't definitive we still ca n't say for sure that coffee drinking prevents suicide but it 's starting to look as though it 's at least possible that the cheapest , most effective , most widely available suicide prevention drug in the world might well be none other than caffeine buy my books or click to find out more , at least have you added your name to our mailing list ? thank you be well
