yesterday i offered a theory for new gene creation which might be called the erroneous translation theory basically , i proposed that new proteins arise through frameshifted and or reversed translation of nucleic acids translation of antisense strands of dna erroneous translation of dna offers interesting possibilities for gain of function recall that most point mutations result in loss of function , and one of the major criticisms of darwinian theory is that evolution based on accumulation of point mutations cannot account for gain of function events wholesale mistranslation via frameshift errors and or wrong strand transcription allow for the sudden emergence of entirely new classes of proteins the unit of change is no longer the single base pair polymorphism but the functional domain or motif an important aspect of antisense strand translation has to do with stop codons in dna , the sequences tca , tta , and cta specify amino acids serine , leucine , and leucine , respectively but when these three codons are complemented , then read in ' to ' direction in other words , when they 're antisense translated they form the stop codons tga , taa , and tag , which tell the cell 's protein making machinery to terminate the production of the current polypeptide thus , if a typical gene containing codons tca , tta , and cta is translated backwards , translation will end prematurely it will end as soon as a stop codon is encountered how important a consideration is this in the real world ? consider the following dna sequence , which represents the gene for the cytidine deaminase enzyme of clostridium botulinum clostridium botulinum a strain atcc v , unmasked , name abs , clb , type cds , feature location chr , genomic location atgaatgattatatagaatatgcaataattgaagcaaaaaaagcattagcaataggagaagtacctgttggagctattatagttaaagaaaataaaattatagcaaaaagtcataatttaaaagagtcattgaaggatccaacagctcatgcagagatattagctataaaagaagcttgcaatacaatacataattggagattaaaaggatgtaagatgtatgtaacattagaaccatgtgctatgtgtgctagtgcaataattcaatctagaataagtgaattgcatataggaacctttgatccagtgggaggggcttgtggatcagtagtaaatataacaaataatagttatttaaaaaataatttaaatattaaatggttatatgatgatgaatgtagtagaataataacaaatttttttaaaaatattagataa the above sequence is the sense strand of the dna , in ' to ' direction the sequence below is the corresponding ' to ' complementary sequence in other words , what 's on the antisense strand of dna tacttactaatatatcttatacgttattaacttcgtttttttcgtaatcgttatcctcttcatggacaacctcgataatatcaatttcttttattttaatatcgtttttcagtattaaattttctcagtaacttcctaggttgtcgagtacgtctctataatcgatattttcttcgaacgttatgttatgtattaacctctaattttcctacattctacatacattgtaatcttggtacacgatacacacgatcacgttattaagttagatcttattcacttaacgtatatccttggaaactaggtcaccctccccgaacacctagtcatcatttatattgtttattatcaataaattttttattaaatttataatttaccaatatactactacttacatcatcttattattgtttaaaaaaatttttataatctatt when the antisense sequence is translated in the normal ' to ' direction , the following amino acid sequence results lsnifkkicyysttfiii pfni iif itiicyiyy stspshwikgsymqftysrlnyctsthstwf cyihltsf spimyciasffys ylcmscwilq lf imtfcynfiffnynssnryfsyc cffcfnycifyiiih this sequence of amino acids shown here using standard one letter amino acid abbreviations contains stop codons depicted as asterisks any attempt to translate the antisense strand of the c botulinum cytidine deaminase gene will result in at best a series of short oligopeptides it 's tempting to conclude that this is nature 's ingenious way of preventing the occurrence of nonsense proteins translate the wrong strand of dna by mistake , and translation quickly terminates in the above example , a stop codon occurs every amino acids , on average but before you jump to that conclusion , consider the cytidine deaminase gene of anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans strain cp c gtggacgagcgcgaggcgatgcaggaggcgctggggctggcgcgcgaggcggcggcccgcggcgaggtgccggtcggcgcggtggcgctgttcgagggccgcgtggtcggccgcggcgcgaacgcccgcgaggcggcgcgcgatcccaccgcgcacgcggagctcctcgcgatccaggaggcggcgcgcaccctcgggcgctggcgcctcaccggcgtcacgctggtggtgacgctcgagccctgcgccatgtgcgccggcgccatggtgctcgcccgcatcgaccggctcgtctacggggcgagcgatcccaaggccggctgcaccggctccctccaggacctgtcggcggacccccggctgaaccaccggttcccggtggagcgcggcctgctggccgaggagtccggcgagctcctccgggccttcttccgggcccgccggggcgccgggaacggaaacggcaacggcggcgagggttag the translation of the antisense version of this gene is ltlaavavsvpgapagpeegpeelagllgqqaalhrepvvqpgvrrqvlegagaaglgiarpvdepvdagehhgagahgaglerhhqrdageapapegarrlldreelrvrggiarrlagvraaadhaaleqrhradrhlaagrrlarqpqrllhrlalvh which contains no stop codons ! why does one version of the gene give ten stop codons when anti translated , whereas the other version gives zero stop codons ? clostridium botulinum has a genome g c content of whereas the dna of anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans has a g c content of the two organisms favor entirely different codons anaeromyxobacter uses codons tca , tta , and cta only , , and of the time , respectively clostridium uses the same codons , , and of the time over times more often than anaeromyxobacter bottom line almost any gene in anaeromyxobacter or any high gc organism , it turns out can be antisense translated without generating stop codons stop codons occur in antisense genes in inverse proportion to the amount of g c in the gene if it 's true that antisense strand translation is or has been an important source of new proteins in nature , the foregoing observation is tremendously relevant , because it means successful reverse translation has likely occurred far more often in high gc organisms than in low gc organisms it suggests that bacteria with high g c content in their genomes may , in fact , have been the incubators of early proteins it implies a gc eden scenario in which early life forms had predominantly high gc genomes low gc organisms then arose through continuous at pressure , from large numbers of accumulated gc to at transition mutations we know that gc to at transition mutations occur at a much higher rate than at to gc transitions this fact is not in dispute even so , we have to ask what is the evidence for reverse antisense strand translation having occurred in nature ? is there any such evidence ? more on this subject tomorrow
