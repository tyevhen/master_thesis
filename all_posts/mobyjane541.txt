hello my name is a and i somehow stumbled onto your website and i read just a few sentences and became extremely interested in your books you sound like you really know what you are talking about , and it seems like sort of a relief because a lot of people now a days seem to just make stuff up as they go along , especially when it comes to anxiety and depression anyways , i am going through a very difficult time in my life , i feel like my life has suddenly stopped and there is a wall in front of me that i ca n't seem to get rid of i feel out of touch with reality and every day is a major obstacle for me to get through it does n't make sense to me because , before this wall seemed to enter into my life , my life seemed somewhat a breeze and i actually enjoyed it now i m often thinking of death and feeling like my life is pointless and i would much rather give up then anything i try to tell myself things will get better and this is just a phase and i will enjoy life again but when i tell myself that , it seems like i'm lying to myself it really just does n't make sense to me it 's like my brain is telling me to not be happy , and i'm supposed to feel this way when , in reality , i know it 's all in my head or something i really do n't know my mother died in march she was and it was very unexpected she was my best friend so my life has literally been taken away from me , because she was my life in july my dad then passed away and the other part of my life was taken from me i have been feeling symptoms of anxiety , if that s what they really are ever since shortness of breath , dizzyness , hands sweating , heart pounding , head tingling , loss of concentration , being very forgetful , mind going blank , shaking and trembling etc i have been to the er twice and had an evaluation at a psychiatric hospital , but they told me i did n't need hospitalization because i was n't in danger of killing myself i do have thoughts of it but i think i would be too scared to act on them i am now seeing a therapist times a week , and i'm going to start seeing a psychiatrist for medication my family doctor has prescribed me the anti depressant generic of celexa and i have been on that for exactly one month today , and have noticed no change in my feelings or thoughts i feel hopeless , and feel like i have nothing left to look forward to i am nineteen , and feel as though my life is over it 's not fair i used to love life the constant thoughts i have in my head seem like a never ending circle and it exhausts me i am desperate to find something to relieve me from this anxious , horrible nightmare that really feels like i'm living in a bad dream well , i guess i am writing you my life story to try to see if you have any ideas that would work for me your thinking strategies really seem to make sense , but i'm not sure i quite know how to change my mindset , it seems really hard i try to but it feels like it 's never going to work , as much as i try , i still have the thought stuck in me that this will never end i also am curious where i can find your books i would love to get them thank you for your time , and i look forward to hearing from you
