a couple of years ago , one of our newer staff members came to me with some concerns about one of my students one concern was that the student was skipping and getting into fights with other peers in his classroom after speaking to the teacher , i decided to ask other staff members if they were having the same issues it was unanimous , all of the teachers were having the same issues with attendance and hostile behavior however , one teacher threw me for a loop the teacher told me that she had noticed that the student had changed her his physical appearance dressing from one gender to another and the student had confided in her that she he was pansexual i asked , um is this a real term ? the teacher just shrugged pansexual flag okay , i admit it i am not very familiar with any terminology outside of lbgtqi spectrum after speaking to the teacher , i decided to conduct my own research first , lbgtqi is the shortened version of lgbpttqqiiaa which represents lesbian , gay , bisexual , pansexual , transgender , transsexual , queer , questioning , intersex , intergender , asexual , ally so , pansexualism does exist and it is a real definition in fact , pansexualism has been a popular term trending on social media since miley cyrus declared this to be her sexual orientation in fact , pansexualism is not a new term and was originally coined by freud as someone who experiences all sexual emotions curious , i decided to look at all the different terminology regarding sexual orientation and i realized how uninformed and out of touch i am with this community which many of our students identify so , i decided to extend my research and become more informed the purpose of this post is to share information with other school counselors who may be just as confused and uninformed now a disclaimer before you read any further , please know that i am not an expert on this subject matter and i am sharing information based on my own research so here goes before i get into specific terminology , it is important to identify and define the differences between gender identity , gender expression , sex , and attraction since i needed this information broken down in simplistic terms , i discovered a video of a non gay person discussing the complexities of gender and sexuality to other non gay or cisgender that means i identify my sex to my gender persons like myself sam killerman has a very informative blog that contains lots of information regarding gender identity , attraction , expression , and sex one helpful piece of information , on his site , is the genderbread person this image gives a great visual that explains all these differences sam killerman 's explains the differences between gender identity and sexual orientation so what are the differences ? great visual to explain differences sogie is the acronym for sexual orientation , gender identity , and expression in order to really understand sexual orientation , one must know the differences between each classification first , let 's discuss gender identity gender identity is how you think of yourself in your head gender varies from country to country , state to state , and culture to culture we tend to view gender as binary or two options however , sociologists identify other types of gender gender identity gender fluid flag one person who identifies as gender fluid or non binary is ruby rose rose is an australian actress who stars in orange is the new black although she was born as a female , rose describes herself as having both male and female characteristics other celebrities who identify as gender fluid include miley cyrus , jaden smith , and the son of susan sarandon for the school counselor , it is helpful to be aware of the different terms regarding gender identifications and to ask a gender fluid person what pronoun he or she prefers gender pronouns as a school counselor , here are some terms that are helpful to know as they relate to gender identity agender person who feels like they do not have a specific gender androgyny feeling of being between male or female bigender a person who identifies as having a two gendered personality cisgender identification of a person 's gender to their birth sex demigirl demiguy a person who is born as female or male and has a slight association with their birth gender however , the person does not have physical discomfort or disassociation because of their identity gender binary person who believes there are only two types of genders male and female genderfluid a person whose gender changes with time , circumstances , or situations intergender a person whose gender identity is between genders or a combination of genders pangender a person who has a combination of genders transgender a person whose birth sex does not match their gender identity trigender may refer to people who feel they have no gender and construct their own gender or a person who moves between three genders third gendered a person who may construct his her own gender gender expression teaching tolerance identifies gender expression as the way we show our gender to the world this can include the types of games we play , the music we listen to , the clothing we wear , and our preference to certain colors there are two scales of measuring expression in gender female and male sam killerman says that the majority of peoples' gender expression aligns to their gender identity however , some people express their gender based on comfort , pleasure , or personal creativity here is an example from killerman describing the concept of gender fluidity in his own life he wakes up in the morning with his hair stuck to his head and drool dripping from his mouth while wearing his boxers masculine he jumps in the shower giving himself a quick facial , thorough body scrub , and emerges smelling like a flower feminine after getting dressed in his skinny jeans and bright colors feminine , he jumps on the bus and conducts business on his phone with words like bro , certain expletives , and other masculine terms getting off the bus , he heads to a coffee shop where sits quietly drinking his black tea feminine in essence , killerman claims we can go from feminine expressions to masculine expressions in a minutes notice marilyn mason switching his gender expression as a school counselor , it is important that we are aware of the laws that protect students who may express their gender differently from the majority of students in our schools in , the department of education reaffirmed a declaration stating that title ix does not conform to just masculinity or femininity when it comes to discrimination educating our staff and students about discrimination can be the first step to gender inclusion also , see the glsen model policy for schools regarding gender inclusion best practices some helpful terms that relate to gender expression cross dressers or transvestites although the majority are heterosexual and identify with their birth gender , they wear clothing of the opposite sex drag queens drag kings gay men and lesbians who are not transgendered and dress as the opposite sex genderqueer a person who identifies as being neither , simultaneously , or consecutively both and or other genders biological sex association psychological association defines sex as a person 's biological status organs , hormones , and chromosomes a person possesses and differs from gender attitudes , feelings , and behaviors although many believe that there are only two sexes , researchers believe this is not the case some babies are born intersex or having two sets of biological characteristics some examples of intersex individuals at birth include a baby with female characteristics who has an enlarged clitoris with no vaginal opening a baby with male characteristics with a small penis and a divided scrotum or a child with a set of xx chromosomes and xy chromosomes although some children are identified as intersex at birth , others do not know until puberty , adulthood , or they never know the intersex society of north america says that once a child is born intersex , it is common practice for the doctor make the decision of the appropriate sex of the child intersex people are most commonly confused with transgender or transsexual people because they may go through hormone therapy or surgery the difference is that transgender people have an identified set of sexual characteristics while intersex people have been identified as lacking one set of sexual characteristics last year , michael phelps was involved in a scandal when he found out that the girl he was dating had been a male while he was in and out of rehab , taylor lianne chandler revealed that she was born as a boy with a penis and a uterus during his teen years , david now taylor , went through surgery and hormone replacement to become a woman i am not sure what happened in their relationship , but michael has now moved on to another woman although we are shocked by such stories , many cultures have become more accepting of other sexes , like intersex and transgender one country , india , allows these groups to vote in national elections under their own sexual preference sexual orientation sexual orientation includes your attraction to others the science of sexual orientation is ongoing and there are some interesting theories behind the emergence of a person 's orientation check out this video from minutes about sexual orientation in , sexual orientation was an extremely hot topic in the media with the passing of gay marriage and the transition of bruce jenner to caitlyn jenner in fact , bruce , i mean caitlyn , even set the guinness book of world records for the fastest twitter account to reach million followers before caitlyn jenner brought the issue of transgender to the public , there was trans teen jazz jennings at age , jazz was coined by barbara walters as the youngest documented person to transition from one sex to another by age , jazz had starting taking hormones to stop puberty and began the transition from male to female currently , jazz has her own show on tlc which chronicles life as a trans teen and is bringing the issue of the transgender teenager into the mainstream there are many issues that come with working with transgender students and many of them will look to the school counselor for comfort , understanding , and assistance jazz jennings since many of our teens are questioning their sexual identity , it is helpful to be aware of the different classifications that students may verbalize staff , students , and parents may look to you for information although , i cannot cover all the terms related to sexual identity
