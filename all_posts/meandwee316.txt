dear little p , you turned months old today and with such zest ! you began really running today , zipping around at lightning speed you love trying to get me or maren the wonder dog to chase you you laugh and squeal with such glee it makes my heart melt and catching you is one of my most favorite things ! you 've gotten good at climbing up onto the furniture grrrr but have n't yet perfected the whole issue of getting back down i 'll be happy when that 's been mastered ! you also love to find a set of stairs to climb up you like to give me heart attacks like that since you are now climbing , it 's hard to take you to the playgrounds that have play structures because you can climb up them , but they all have openings where you can fall out so , you end up crying all the time because i take you down from them i want to encourage you to climb , but in a safe way i'm now finding new places to take you that do n't involve climbing structures that are huge and dangerous the acton arboretum nearby , is the perfect place it 's huge and filled with gardens , woods , trails , paths , bridges and just overall beauty to explore you can run completely freely and safely you love it ! there 's so much to explore , find , and touch i like it because i do n't have to be in panic mode and there 's nothing for you to climb up and fall off of yet lucky for me you are n't climbing trees at this point anyway , we spent the cooler part of the morning there just enjoying the atmosphere and spending some nice time together later in the day , after your nap , we went swimming at walden pond such a beautiful , clear and clean body of water but way too crowded ! i think the little pond and beach just across the way will be where we spend most of our water time from now on it 's got much more room for running around and much less people ! it does have a darned play structure for you to climb , but you are n't interested when we are going in the water i hope you had a fun day today i had fun with you i had a hard time getting you out of the water you kept wanting to run deeper and deeper in and you did n't even seem to mind when you accidentally went over your head and gulped too much water i tried to seem calm in front of you but i was freaking the heck out inside you make me want to be brave for your sake and my own anyway , you are in love with the water and it 's fun to watch you putter all around and flail your arms in it the joy you express is contagious to everyone around you mostly me it 's funny people always warned me about how different things were to be when you started walking there was such a negative spin on it i was practically terrified i was worried about all the trouble you 'd get into and how i would have so much more work now that it has happened , i am happy to report that i'm really enjoying myself and this time you are definitely doing a lot more , but it 's much more fun now i was always vigilant to watch over you before , so not much has changed for me in that area but now , i can take you places and plop you down and off you go ! it 's almost easier now i feel like i 've rejoined the world and you get to be part of it too it 's fun to watch you make discoveries and find out about the world on your own two feet life just got a whole lot more interesting and enriched and i'm loving every second of being with you you really helped me get back out there and smell the roses and for that i'm forever grateful i'm so proud and happy for you i'm one lucky mama love you always and forever , mama save
