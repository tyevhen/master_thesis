here is what i just posted over at the nitty gritty of anxiety i have a cat got her as a cute kitten but now she is a cat this is the first one that i have ever owned i am a big animal lover , but this cat has been testing my patience she has issues with a quiet house anytime someone is sleeping , she ca n't stand it and starts meowing she meows right outside my daughter 's door when she is napping worse is every night when the family tries to sleep and the wee hours of the morning constantly meowing , loudly she has food and water , access to the outside , access to any room she wants , lots of cat toys , two dogs to play with , but nothing keeps her quiet on top of all that she 's mean and bites or scratches you if you try to touch her i am at my wits end , willing to try anything so i do n't have to give her away today i found and interesting product in the pet aisle its called an anti stress calming collar and is designed to safely and effectively calm cats the box continues , ideal for stressful and unexpected situations the collar contains pheromones that are supposed to naturally calm your pet cat i bought it to try out for nighttime to see if it could help calm my uneasy cat so i can finally get a good night 's sleep as i was reading the box i found myself thinking , where 's my anti stress calming collar ? would n't it be great if someone invented a similar collar , like a bracelet for example to help you with anxiety ? the boxes could read the same thing , ideal for stressful and unexpected situations take it out before going to that party and tah dah ! you are anxiety free for the evening having a rough batch of morning anxiety ? slip it on when you first wake up and your day is suddenly much brighter it would be nice if there was a simple cure all for our anxiety unfortunately we as humans are very complicated creatures and our minds are not so easily fooled also unfortunate , the calming collar did nothing to stop my cats meowing problem have you ever tried a product claiming to cure anxiety only to have it not work ? if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like how stress affects the body my story what to do when feeling overwhelmed relaxation technique calming music linkwithin
