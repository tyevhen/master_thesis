someone said something rather nice to me the other day he said , you do n't deserve to be cursed at i thought that was rather sweet i have to say that after a couple decades in the profession i rather took it for granted that getting sworn at occasionally was part of the job i could be blessed in my morning clinic and cursed in my afternoon clinic and it just goes with the territory i do n't really take it personally and it rather amuses me that people could see me so differently in a single day when i am really the same person all day i mean , not having a twin like the psychiatrist in double billing oh by the way , the next installment of double celling is up too i'm not a therapist but i know in therapy the clinician expects that at various times in treatment people may become annoyed or upset or angry for reasons that may or may not be reality based being a good psychiatrist means being able to handle a patient 's strong emotions with them while remaining a stable figure in the patient 's life you just ca n't have thin skin about it so anyway , it was interesting hearing this from a non mental health professional lay person from the outside it does seem odd on the inside it 's just a way of life
