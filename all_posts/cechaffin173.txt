i just finished a whirlwind trip to southern california , where i cleaned out storage , obtained legal help regarding a certain matter , had lunch with old friends and partied with my daughters at various venues , including shooting pool in a gay bar last time we went there i was hit on by a man nearly my size but i demurely declined , having no natural urges for such trysts for my birthday present my daughter arranged a visit with my grandson jacob here 's an old picture he 's six now i ca n't believe how much he reminds me of my late daughter , rachel not only does he have her coloring , but his lanky , athletic movements and supreme distractibility make for a behavioral copy as well his mother had auditory add , and just like with her i had to tell him five times not to step on the pumpkins at the pumpkin patch we visited , whereas with my other daughters once was sufficient he 's a free spirit with boundless energy and it 's really hard to get his attention sometimes i do give credit to his father and grandmother for teaching him good manners anyway , though it had been over a year , he bolted right up into my arms and we played all day i bought him a play set of vikings and he said , oh grandpa ! i love vikings ! how did you know ? being nordic myself , i told him you are a viking we carved a ginormous pumpkin later with both a ghost and a bat design he lost interest in that project quickly and went back to play with his viking set my youngest daughter , sarah , which means princess , while i was there , never traveled with an entourage of less than five then she 's always been like that , surrounded by friends and admirers as a stage performer she has charisma , which is hard to explain given her parents' retarded social skills at the same age this only goes to show that personality is genetic , and when the dna dice roll , you get what you get , even if it does n't look like or behave like you here 's sarah at her high school graduation with a proud papa in a marathon effort i drove six hundred miles from long beach to mendocino yesterday , averaging mph including gas and food stops it amazed me since driving down i took two days but i wanted to see kathleen so badly and could n't face another econolodge for any interested in my upcoming book , a hardback for due out february , you can do me a great favor if you have any connections to literary magazines for potential reviews i 've lined up three already but hope to have ten times that amount prior to its debut cross your fingers for me , or better , direct your fingers to a friendly editor to pitch the possibility of a review and you can also write your own review and submit it are you listening , norm ? to any so inclined in either capacity , i 'd be happy to mail you a pdf copy prior to publication , with the hope that having a cyberversion will not dissuade you from buying the actual book j alfred was , of course , ecstatic to see me and he licked most of the hair off my bald head , i fear , in his excitement nice to have a pack animal around in all , the river of life pushed me with a strong current through all the affairs down south , and things went swimmingly i surprised myself my usual reaction to the polyglot concrete playground of la was held in abeyance with an assist from the grateful dead blasting as i entered the web of endless freeways did you know california roads rank second to last in the nation ? it is estimated that in la alone , maintenance for a car is increased yr by the bad roads and rather than repairing our roads , this year 's ballot has a proposition to fund a high speed rail between the bay area and la at the cost of megabillions new jobs are promised i suppose the relationship between borrowing and job creation is only par for the course in our presently upside down economy who coulda thunk , years ago , that the world would constantly borrow from the future to pay for the present ? i wonder what eliot would have thought of that certainly pound blew his mind over it nothing more to report this morning i am well i 've also lost more weight , having broken the zero of the key is eating less duh ! i mail my ballot today i may actually vote for the high speed rail as i tire of driving miles to see my daughters and grandson , though next time i expect i 'll fly and to ralph and eric thanks so much for joining me at a historic bar for a three hour , three beer lunch it was divine kilobunnies , dr chaffin
