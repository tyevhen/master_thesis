artist celeste prize empty space poem by cindy wolf i sit i stare my body sinks i slouch i sigh my eyes do n't blink i hear a noise it floats on by i want to think but cannot try i see a blur it fades away i open my mouth no words to say nothing below above around between just an empty space without a dream
