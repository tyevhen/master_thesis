sideways shrink posed a great question recently in a comment on my post when a thick skin helps the question was whether or not physicians are allowed to hit a patient who tries to assault them certainly , physical assaults on patients are not the standard of practice in psychiatry or any other medical specialty psychiatrists do undergo some training about physical management of violent patients i remember in residency we had to get trained in take down and restraint procedures as a group we practiced applying pressure point joint locks on each other in order to make a patient break a grip on us , and to do two person restraints to hold someone immobile until security could arrive none of this involved any crouching tiger , hidden dragon type kung fu moves , there was no kicking or hitting or loud kiai karate yells there was a lot of talk about the importance of being as least forceful as possible frankly , i'm not sure how much of that i would have remembered if i had ever been in a position to have to use it the few times when i was actually assaulted by patients the incidents happened so fast there really was n't anything i could have done ok , so the little manic lady who hit me with a stuffed dog really could n't count as an assault , and she was already restrained in a geri chair to begin with but the real question is will a doctor get into trouble for defending him or herself ? in situations like this it 's always best , as one of my friends and mentors regularly states , to think clinically before thinking legally safety first , then legalisms do what you must do to protect yourself learn the security procedures for your hospital or clinic or school or correctional facility , and know them so well you do n't have to even think to act on them if no one orients you to security procedures on your new job , make a point of asking free society employers are particularly bad about this , particularly in an outpatient setting even when you follow the right procedures though , it takes some time to get help by time , i mean several seconds to minutes , and in that short time a lot of damage can happen yes , doctors can and should defend themselves from attack what are the potential legal consequences ? disclaimer i'm not a lawyer , anything i say can and might be wrong from a legal standpoint , when in doubt call your hospital counsel or malpractice risk management office the consequences could be civil or criminal an assault or battery charge could be filed by a patient , or a general tort injury civil suit could be filed against a physician a malpractice claim could be made i doubt anyone could claim that a physician assault against a patient would be a standard part of psychiatric treatment ! however in states that allow contributory negligence a limitation on damages when an injury is caused in part by patient behavior the physician 's liability would be limited finally , the patient could file a board complaint against the physician so even in the absence of a criminal or civil case the physician could end up on the wrong end of a long , drawn out and painful licensure investigation there are factors that could lead to a greater risk of legal consequences if they suggest that more force was used than necessary if the patient dies or has a serious permanent injury , or if the physician has a chance to escape but chooses to stay and fight instead and yes , gender discrimination may play a role if the physician is a young twenty something , male , six foot four inch tall physician weighing pounds and the patient attacker is a five foot , pound grey haired old lady , you could be in trouble off the top of my head i'm not aware of any cases where this has been an issue , and in the heat or rather terror of the moment i doubt any doctor is going to stop and weigh out all the potential consequences and even when the doctor has a legitimate need to defend himself there could still be legal consequences , which are not fun even if the doctor ends up cleared of all allegations if i come across any relevant cases or references i 'll put them up , but that 's what i think off the top of my head
