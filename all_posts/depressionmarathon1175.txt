busy , busy , busy leads to tired , tired , tired apparently yesterday , after briefly getting up to attend to puck , i slept until noon ! i did n't get much done after getting up , either every piece of my physical being felt weighted with lead by , i needed another nap ! after more hours of sleep , i forced myself from my bed , but to no avail i may have been standing , but neither my mind nor my body was awake an entire day swallowed by fatigue i mentioned training for a marathon takes a ton of time it may seem obvious , but i failed to mention it takes a ton of energy , too i need to be very careful during this time one step too many , and more days like yesterday will descend one step that 's how it feels it 's like that old game , do n't spill the beans where each player piles a single bean on top of the precariously balanced kettle bean number might be fine , but bean number empties the pot maybe sunday 's mile was my ninth bean , but mile emptied my monday pot or maybe it was the fact that i was busier than usual over the weekend maybe those couple extra hours of work were enough to skew the balance , i do n't know with depression , life is a precarious balancing act throwing marathon training into the pot makes it even more tipsy endurance training with depression requires extra vigilance everything i do , i scrutinize how will eating that food fuel my next run ? will it help or hurt ? if i have my coffee now , will i be able to run , or should i run now , risk getting a headache , and then have coffee ? i have to do miles this weekend , should i run saturday and work sunday or the other way around ? if i run miles at , will i have enough recovery time before the meeting ? should i skip the meeting so i do n't have to worry about it ? you get the idea everything i do i filter through my training needs this scrutiny may not be any different than that of normie marathoners even normie runners are fatigued right now this point in the training program , four to six weeks prior to the goal marathon , is always fatiguing the long runs are really long i really do have to run miles this weekend and the short runs are no longer short my legs are constantly tired , and i rarely feel recovered prior to my next run motivation is difficult this seems true whether a normie runner or not the difference for me , a non normie , is a day like yesterday may have dire consequences a day of overwhelming fatigue and functional inability can drag me into the abyss depression can cause fatigue , but unfortunately fatigue can also trigger my depression that one extra bean , which upsets my balance , results in a bad run or even a bad day as happened yesterday unfortunately , that bad day may cascade into a full scale emptying of my pot barren days , weeks , or months could follow it 's tricky days like yesterday scare the crap out of me i am not a normie i must be vigilent balance is key , but training for a marathon intensifies and complicates that necessity
