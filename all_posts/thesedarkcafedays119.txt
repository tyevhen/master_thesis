all good dreamers pass this way some day hidin' behind bottles in dark cafes , dark cafes only a dark cocoon before i get my gorgeous wings and fly away only a phase , these dark cafe days joni mitchell last time i saw richard i 've known for most of my life that i am not quite right upstairs i first started being consumed with anxiety in first grade the tyranny of my type a teacher triggered the anxious tendencies i had inherited from my mom and i turned into a nervous wreck who would cry all the way to school and beg to stay home the anxiety would manifest itself again throughout my school life in fourth and fifth grade i became obsessed with the fear of getting detention , which was regularly threatened to us to prepare us for middle school when i was doled out this prison sentence in fourth grade after forgetting to do my math homework , i must have had to choke back tears , feeling thoroughly chastised in fifth grade , my mom eventually told my teacher about my terror because i remember ms w pulling me aside one day and explaining i had nothing to worry about i was a model student and she would never give me detention i remember crying while packing my bag for the first day of school every summer for the next several years of secondary school i wept every night the first week of my junior year of high school because of the complete overwhelm i felt at the thought of taking three advanced placement classes but it is an official decree of suburban high schools that if you do n't take as many ap 's as humanly possible , you wo n't get into college and so will work at mcdonald 's and die a premature death you can imagine the terror that was the first weeks of college and , well , the whole of college , for me five minutes after saying good bye to my family , i called my mom and begged her to come back an take me home here i am now after a year and a half of official treatment concoctions of pills , heart bearing sessions with stony faced psychiatrists and counselors conversations that cost a small fortune , may i add an unemployed , virtually housebound college drop out who ca n't get a job or fit into any of her favorite clothes and is sometimes gripped with inexplicable terror of leaving the house who sits dreading tomorrow because i have to possibly interact with the maids coming in to clean the house , and go to an appointment with my counselor and dreads the day after because i'm supposed to sit around the house anticipating going to the doctor go to the doctor with heart beating and stomach twisting talk to the scary receptionists who hate life and even more , hate you sit in a large napkin and talk to a stranger about all my shortcomings as a human being and than be mercilessly tickled and prodded and made to feel as uncomfortable as possible to make things brief anxiety is crippling it sucks the life out of you and it takes you unawares a month ago i was driving myself to community college four days a week and ordering bagels from panera like nobody 's business i was still a hot mess , but i was semi functional then something snapped inside of me and i found myself lying on my bed in the fetal position , whimpering like a little rescue puppy , telling my exasperated sister that i just could n't go to class i could n't i could barely get out of bed , much less venture outside of my house i know a lot of people wo n't get this story i sound pitiful and lazy and cowardly to many , no doubt i view myself that way a lot , too i have spent over a decade pushing myself to overcome this monster of fear inside of me , bullying myself for backing out when things got too overwhelming this year , i finally just fell to pieces and i seem to be stuck that way my efforts to pull myself into some kind of passable , working human being seem to just lead me to explode again it 's embarrassing it 's frustrating it 's a process of constantly going back to square one or square negative one i thought healing would be a lot easier than this i thought this failure to meet basic human standards for living would just be a phase i thought i 'd have an epiphany or a turning point or a saving grace it seems to happen to other people that i read about when i went on medication a year ago , i never guessed i 'd be one of those pitiful people you read about who has tried umpteen meds and is still a sad year old overweight tv addict on unemployment but i ca n't keep track of the opportunities that have fell through and the medications that have n't worked and , damn it i'm still waiting on a breakthrough this is my journey it is n't too nitty gritty and dark , thankfully , but it is n't the blue skies i like to portray it to be i want to honestly share my struggles in life because it has meant so much to me to hear other people do so and because i want people going through similar things to know they 're not alone i guess this may be hard to read because it 's not exactly uplifting or optimistic , but if you will bear with me , i hope this can give you some insight into what life is like for those who struggle with mental illness the song i quoted at the beginning resonates with me a lot because it has this dark , desperate undertone of trying to convince oneself that you 're on the mend and better times are just around the bend i feel stuck hiding behind bottles in a dark cafe , dreaming up schemes to break free of the dark cocoon suffocating me a cocoon i was supposed to shed as my fellow pupae have done but maybe healing , like so many things in life , is a long term process full of setbacks and pitfalls and shortcomings for some people , mental illness is not just a phase , but a lifelong battle hear joni mitchell 's last time i saw
