this post has nothing to do with kennedy s disease or exercise or coping with disease this is about survival in the world of technology i have had computers since the days of the ibm at with dos operating system , k of memory , one floppy drive and a ten megabyte hard drive when i bought my first computer i was told i would never fill up the hard drive how things change today i have a gigabyte hard drive , gigabytes of memory , a quad four processor , a read write cd dvd optical drive i think you get the point in all the years i have been computing i have never lost a hard drive okay , let me correct that until monday of this week i had never lost a hard drive fortunately , i have always backed up my entire hard drive daily to an external drive and to the cloud since my current computer is used mainly for kennedy s disease association work , i always felt redundancy was important my dell vostro has been a workhorse for three years without one problem like anything , however , it can break down as soon as i saw an error message in the acronis drive monitor program i called dell they tried several options before deciding my drive had to be replaced dell shipped the replacement drive out with one day s service great i immediately began sweating bullets thinking the worst , but hoping for the best after the new drive was installed , i really became nervous i did not have a lot of confidence that my acronis true image backup software would do what it was supposed to do i loaded the software from its cd and began to say a prayer fortunately for me , the software was designed to be intuitive and after a few clicks of the mouse , it started to restore my data a message appeared and said that it would take minutes i had breakfast and took my dog for a walk when i returned , the message on the screen said , a reboot is required reboot now ? as the program shut down my focus remained on the screen wondering and hoping that everything would work when it started back up my confidence level was still in the range , however amazing ! miraculous ! fantastic ! my entire operating system and all my data and configurations were restored without a hitch i was fully operational with one hour i cannot even begin to imagine how long it would have taken to reinstall my drivers , reconfigure my hardware and operating system , download the microsoft updates and the dozens of programs and as well as their updates , etc if i had only saved my documents i believe i paid several years ago for acronis true image and for my external hard drive those two items turned out to be one of the best investments i have ever made the message for today is backup backup backup
