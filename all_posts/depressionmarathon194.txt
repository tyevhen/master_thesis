there was a half marathon race in rochester yesterday i did n't attend it was just another in a long list of races on which i have been unable to report this year in fact , the last time i raced was late october , since i began this running thing over years ago , i do n't think i 've ever gone this long without running a race it 's weird i realized today the entire summer racing season has come and gone i missed it all and i do did miss it i volunteered a couple of times , but it was n't the same as racing i missed the buzz of race day , the nerves , and the other runners i missed the opportunity to push my body to its limit i missed the potential each race brought for a new experience , a faster time , or different competition it was a very strange summer without running or racing in my life i'm thinking about this today not only because of yesterday 's event , but also because i went for a walk for the first time today jet and i have not been on a walk since i tore my achilles in late april it 's been months since i 've even taken a walk ! no wonder i do n't feel good ! jet and i walked slowly for about miles along our familiar route through the local neighborhoods i think there was still some snow on the ground the last time we took that walk ! i was almost moved to tears just to be outside walking with jet and my achilles did not hurt ! i 'll soon have an official achilles update i see my orthopedic doctor later this week i know it 's not completely healed , but i am encouraged i was able to gently walk without pain hopefully , the doctor will have good news for me i really miss running
