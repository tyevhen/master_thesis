i truly have nothing new to report tonight i'm exhausted i 've had three long , very busy days of work in a row , with another on the horizon tomorrow work has been good , even fun , but spending so many hours with debilitated patients with multiple needs is fatiguing i 've only been home for about an hour and a half tonight , and i'm already preparing for bed i did get my mile run in before work this morning , but gi distress made it quite challenging and frustrating speaking of frustrating , my mood continues to challenge , too unfortunately , there 's been little change i apologize i feel less than inspiring tonight i'm trying to be patient everything is temporary , so i know change is on the way i'm tired , but i have yet to give up i guess that 's encouraging hopefully i 'll have more positive news in a few days thanks for listening , my friends
