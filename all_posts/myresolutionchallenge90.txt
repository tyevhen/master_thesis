normality has returned to the wilson household well , as normal as you can get with three teenagers under one roof ! we all shuffled back to school , college and work this week with as much enthusiasm as a wet mop i m not surprised about the kids that comes with the territory , but i m a different story i love my job very much and yet i returned with a melancholy aura my evenings aren t much better at the end of last year , i would finish work to do my household chores i d feed the kids , clean the fish and then settle down in front of my laptop to bash out a chapter or two and tackle an article or blog post instead , i find myself staring at the wall with a bewildered expression plastered to my face it s not writers block i know this because my head is crammed full of story and blog post ideas that scream at me with every waking moment thank goodness for post it notes ! it finally hit me at am the other morning as i tossed and turned in bed and eventually turned the light on to empty my thoughts onto paper i ve been so busy organising my blog content to help motivate my readers that i forgot all about setting my goals ! i feel like a balloon let loose in the sky and is floating aimlessly that perfect quote , a dream without a plan is just a wish is on repeat in my brain so , here i am goal free and feeling twitchy , irritable and adrift all around me i hear my friends talking about their ambitions for , and i m jealous they are so in control , and i realise with horror that my mojo has been packed away with the christmas decorations i resort to an hour of meditation , colouring in and baking and before long i begin to feel human again cake helps ! what i need to do next is give myself a damn good talking to ! so i lock myself away , not a difficult task as my three children are prone to hibernating in their bedrooms and i log on to pinterest being a visual person i need to see bright images of happy , smiling people , it never fails to lift my spirits armed with a mug of tea and a notepad i set about searching the site for inspiration before long , i stumbled across the board for art journals these are small pocket books full of painted images , watercolours and research notes the perfect tool for any artist i am not any artist , i am no artist at all , but the idea stirs a thought the thought triggers a string of ideas and before i know it i m plotting a power word journal more on this next week i m starting to feel in the zone , and a few concepts are emerging the next pinterest search pulls up one of my favourite pastimes list writing turning to my notepad , i jot down several ideas that spring to mind as i read through the variety of lists what makes you happy ?
