it started maybe close to two weeks ago and seems to have reached a crescendo today i don t know what triggered it we had slacked off a bit on his dose of the mitochondrial cocktail while we were away , and just went back up to the recommended amount he has had major sleep disturbances this week after we did that he has also been on aricept for exactly months i am talking about nate , it s almost like someone turned on a light , all right , maybe with a bit of a dimmer switch , but a light nonetheless it s his speech , and it s freaking amazing to see here are the words we have heard in the past few weeks if i can remember them all bye bye , carla , go , up , open , bath , chicken , fry , corn , juice , chip , no well duh , jack , night night for which he says da da , but he does it consistently , he said no no jack when jack was shoving his lollipop in his face after ot tonight and he has said things , like , go bye bye or carla , bye bye he waves bye bye , he claps his hands , he stomps his feet , and best of all , he gives kisses this has all developed in the last month after two years of basically more and cup and a few words gained and lost in the mix the key in all of this is one that will have every autism mama shaking her fist with joy when she reads this he is repeating sounds and words when we ask him to he has figured out what that means , and figured out that he can do it and he is doing it he is really really doing it i m not even that afraid to say it because it s such a dramatic improvement that even if he regresses again i truly don t believe he can go back to where he was once a fundamental concept like repetition is grasped , it s much harder to lose than one random word here or there so repeating is a step in this journey he doesn t necessarily know the reason he is saying all of these things although i think he knows for many of them and he requires prompting as his speech pathologist carla was telling me , we need to use these action words with him consistently now , so every single time we get to a door , i need to kneel down , make sure we establish eye contact , and say open until he says it too same at the car door , and then up before he gets in his chair we have been saying the words like this , but now that we can truly get his attention , it takes some more , well worth it , work to make sure the joint attention is there right now , it feels like i have won the lottery each and every time he says a word all parents are thrilled to hear a new word from their child right ? imagine waiting years to hear bye bye ? or up ? an average person on the street would think i am nuts the way i jump up and down , hug nate , and nearly cry each time he verbalizes something not nuts , just very very grateful so to every mom and dad of a neurotypical little one , and to my beautiful little sister who is soon going to witness these events with her own son , i say this do this for me just humor me when you hear a first word , or a new word , or see your child point , after you celebrate , which you should , repeat what i am saying now to yourself , please not out loud you might get a few looks lol this is a miracle this is magic and no matter how difficult it is sometimes , and speaking as the mom of another child who never ever stops talking i know just how difficult it can be don t let yourself take it for granted that s one issue i don t have with nate i take none of it for granted i am an emotional wreck tonight after all of the things i have heard him say today i want to go shake him awake and make him talk i want to pinch him , wake him up and make sure he will still repeat up i want to line up all of his snacks and repeat over and over again what each one is , just to see if he will say it i want jack to annoy the crap out of him just to hear him say no instead , i will just say this little prayer tonight first , thank you god this is amazing and i am in awe of what my little boy can do but , please god , please let this be it ! ! ! please don t take this away from him again his mama could n't handle it see this face ? ? ? that little look ? little stinker 's been holding out on us ! the jig is up buddy !
