it would be a relief if my motivation and mood were simply low right now instead , i am experiencing a lack of mood and no motivation have you ever heard of such a thing ? it sounds silly writing it down , but it does seem to be my current reality i can find nothing redeemable to pull me out of this funk i can find no reason to accomplish any of what needs to be accomplished i even missed work as a result of my non mood and motivation why bother ? i cannot seem to pull myself off the couch i cannot stay awake long enough even if i could i cannot wrap my mind around anything other than destructive thoughts is this depression ? it started as typical depression symptoms , the gray cloak and all , but i seem to have hit a new low or should i say a new no i 've got nothing i 've got nothing to say i 've got nothing to offer i 've got nothing to contribute what am i doing here ? i feel like a despicable speck of dead move on nothing to see or read here
