it 's shocking how much venom and bile you can stir up by criticizing darwin in public i more or less expected , when i wrote a post critical of evolutionary theory at bigthink com , there 'd be a few heated comments i did n't expect so many of the comments to be so heated quite a few of the comments were and are just plain ugly and the most vitriolic attacks came not from the religious right , but from supporters of darwin ! looks like i struck a nerve some people jumped to the conclusion that , with my post , bigthink was selling creationism under a thin veneer of science that 's just plain wrong i am not a creationist i consider creationism magical thinking it may be satisfying to others it 's not for me more than one commenter suggested i get some biology training before writing about evolution i guess i should have made clear , up front , that i have two degrees in biology a b s from uci and a master 's in microbiology summa cum laude from uc davis , where i was a regents' fellow i took and passed qualifying exams for a ph d one of the specialty areas i was examined in was molecular genetics what did i say in my bigthink blog that was so controversial ? first let 's get clear what i did not say one of the commenters claimed i said changes in dna were not responsible for evolution i never said that what i said was that point mutations of the kind the give rise to single nucleotide polymorphisms are almost certainly not a major driver of evolution we know this because it 's been demonstrated many times that the majority of non neutral point mutations are deleterious , leading to loss of function , not gain of function spend some time reading about muller 's ratchet if you do n't believe me how , then , does speciation occur ? we do n't know no one has seen it occur in the lab nature no doubt relies on a variety of tactics , some of which we know a good deal about , many of which we barely understand , no doubt others of which we have n't yet discovered we know that sexuality which is probably around a billion years old has led to an explosion of diversity and has kept muller 's ratchet from sending countless species into extinction on a molecular level , there are still many things we do n't understand about how chromatin is managed , how micro rna is regulated , when and why dna methylases come into play , the relative importance or unimportance of translocases , and much , much more to assert that we understand how speciation occurs is to assert a half truth it 's like saying we understand the weather because we can measure atmospheric pressure one of the major embarrassments of modern biology is that more than a decade after having sequenced the human genome , we still do n't know what most of our dna does we can account for , human genes which is not even ten times the number of genes in e coli meanwhile our dna has enough base pairs to encode million genes but we 're pretty sure the true number of human genes is under , what does all that dna do ? we have some hints at answers , but no more than that note when the surplus of dna in the human genome was first discovered , scientists called it junk dna it took years for that unfortunate terminology to disappear the honest answer is , we 're still not even close to understanding what all our dna is doing it 's been my experience that the best scientists are humble , rather than proud they 're willing to concede the immensity of what they do n't know arrogance and over confidence are hallmarks of immaturity , in science as well as in life if we 're humble , and honest , we have to admit that physics is unable to explain where most of the matter and energy in the universe is no one knows what dark matter is , where it came from , what its properties are , whether it 's made of particles , how long it 's been around , whether it obeys normal laws of physics , etc if we 're humble , we have to admit we do n't know what most of the human genome is doing we also have to admit we do n't know how or why the cambrian explosion happened darwin himself conceded that the cambrian explosion posed a major unanswered challenge to his theory we have to admit we have no idea how life originated on earth the list of things we do n't understand is far longer than the list of things we do understand if we do n't understand that , all is lost
