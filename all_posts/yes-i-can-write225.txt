yesterday , i asked , in a youtube video , for people to ask me questions about unschooling and i got lots of interesting questions ! i tried to do a video on this one , but i was having a lot of trouble getting my opinions on this subject across in that format so , i decided to answer it in a blog post instead ! the question is in italics , my answer in regular font let 's say children are like seeds in order to grow into good people , they do n't need to be forced to grow , because they do that naturally but that said , a seed must be planted in fertile soil , in the right climate , and must be watered , etc what if some kinds of media today threaten the minds of the young for example , television which provides immediate satisfaction but gives no decent returns in the long run may be more compelling than a book firstly , i think you re making a huge jump in saying that television gives no decent returns in the long run , and automatically assuming that a book has more value than a tv show ! i totally disagree with that ! also , what s wrong with instant satisfaction ? a life well lived is one made up of many happy moments if watching tv gives you joy , i don t really see how it s in anyway unworthy of your time i m an avid reader , and have been for many years books have enriched my life in many ways ! but , so has tv when i was young , i watched tons of science shows and history shows tons of educational shows on a variety of topics i also just watched some fictional shows i was never a particularly big tv watcher , but it was never forbidden to me , and i enjoyed what i did watch i also learned a ton ! my opinion is that if kids have less manufactured entertainment stimuli they are forced to use their imagination to invent their own games , stories , etc but because of the exponential growth of media , it is getting harder and harder to give children a world which does not numb their minds and imagination again , i totally disagree storytelling fuels imagination , and at their hearts , all types of fiction , be it novels , comic books , tv shows , movies , or oral storytelling , is just that storytelling you find similar elements in all of them , and stories , no matter the medium they re told in , can bring great joy , fuel imagination , cause you to question deeply held beliefs , ask profound questions storytelling is an amazing art , and i find it rather sad when people start passing judgments on what types of storytelling are good or bad i also want to give some real life examples of this far from squelching my very creative sister s imagination she currently writes tons of fiction , my sister would play pretend all the time based on various favourite movie characters she would also , as a young child , spend hours alone in her room just creating huge complex stories and worlds soon , that imagination was used to start writing fiction she s currently working on her first novel ! and she even plays video games , supposedly the most mind numbing things out there , and has played them for years and yet this brings up two competing ideas about freedom should we free the child in the immediate moment , by imposing no limits on how they spend their time or can we control their environment so that they are more likely to build their imaginations and judgements ? i m sure you ve gathered my opinion on this by now i do recognize that some okay , a lot of stuff on tv has messages that really aren t so great as do tons of books out there , i might add but i m not advocating casting your kids loose and ignoring them while they do nothing but watch tv when you have a good , attentive relationship with your kids , one where you discuss what they re seeing , have good dialogue , you re exposing them to the world around you , with all of it s negative and positive influences , and doing so while remaining a loving , supportive , and knowledgeable companion i don t think that sheltering your kid does anything but make things more difficult for them later on i also think that any time you make something forbidden to your child , you ve just made it the most interesting thing out there kids are curious , and if they re denied access to something , chances are they ll both really want to get access to it , and quite likely resort to lying and going behind their parents backs to do so really , i don t blame them ! i ve come to this conclusion from my own experiences growing up , which were that the more controlled a child was , the more likely they where to frequently lie to their parents it was the only way they could have freedom i also want to add that even now , i find tv very educational i find advertising fascinating , i find the underlying assumptions and worldviews in mainstream shows fascinating , and watching tv sometimes helps me to remember how most of the world thinks my sister regularly tells me i ve forgotten what normal is ! so that s my answer to that question i hope i ve given some insight into it ! peace , idzie you might also like storytelling an art with many forms , or why tv shows i want to unschool , but what if my kids just watch tv unschooling is learning from everything why some learning is n't better than other learning linkwithin
