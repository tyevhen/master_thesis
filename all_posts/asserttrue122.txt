an anti depression intervention that s purported to work reliably indeed , some consider it a kind of gold standard of last ditch treatment options is electroconvulsive therapy ect it s specifically approved for refractory depression , and most clinicians will tell you in no uncertain terms that it tends to be efficacious that s not entirely accurate , however in fact , it s pretty far off the mark relief from depression is not guaranteed , and if you get any relief , it will be short lived typically days what 's more , recent statistics show that ect cannot in good faith be called safe ect is associated with death at a far higher rate than the american psychiatric association has been telling people something i 'll talk about more in a separate post it also causes cognitive damage that , in a surprising number of cases , is permanent cognitive after effects tend to fall into two categories anterograde amnesia and retrograde amnesia the latter is well known it means you have trouble recalling past events the former is a type of learning disability it 's where you ca n't recall newly learned material advocates for ect tend to downplay these effects the effects are quite a bit more serious than most people realize , however i 'll lay out the evidence on this in a later post if you 're in a hurry to learn the results , see the chapter that begins on page of hack your depression with ect , the patient is anesthetized for to minutes with a short acting barbiturate , commonly brevital methohexital once the patient is unconscious , a muscle relaxant succinylcholine is injected to reduce the risk of fractures , joint dislocations , and damage to skeletal muscle , tendons , and ligaments which were common in patients before this modification became routine during the s the muscle relaxant causes a partial paralysis of the body , including the respiratory system , so that the patient must be supplied oxygen through a mask and assisted in breathing until the muscle relaxant wears off and the patient is able to resume breathing on his or her own electrodes are placed either bilaterally or on the right side of the head shock is administered by a machine , at the push of a button the sudden administration of current causes the patient to experience a grand mal seizure the tonic clonic effects of which are attenuated , due to the muscle relaxant but make no mistake , the brain is undergoing a full blown seizure after six to twelve shock sessions usually spaced a few days apart , you ll either feel better , or not generally , people who report positive results feel better for a few days after a month , the effects are gone no one , to this day , can explain exactly why ect works when it does work , which isn t always and never for very long it is completely without scientific basis in terms of any credible scientific theory for its mode of action the most parsimonious high level explanation is that by inducing amnesia , it causes you to forget your troubles the idea for ect came from the mistaken belief , or more years ago , that epilepsy was never found to coexist with schizophrenia hence , if one could induce epilepsy in a schizophrenic patient , it might cure schizophrenia which makes about as much sense as saying that because laughter and depression seldom co occur , you should administer tickling therapy to people who are depressed this bizarre myth became the basis for a long line of human and animal experiments with shock therapy , culminating in today s fda approved ect note at one time , cats , dogs , and monkeys were widely used in shock experiments large animal experiments have long since been discontinued , however , for humane reasons today , ect is fda approved for the following indications a refractory depression unipolar and bipolar b schizophrenia c bipolar mania and mixed states d schizoaffective disorder e schizophreniform disorder f catatonia most ect therapy involves receiving two to three shocks a week for at least two weeks sometimes the shock is administered bilaterally sometimes it s localized to one side of the brain the cost , if you pay out of pocket , is rarely less than , per treatment around , americans per year submit to ect with an average cost of , per shock and to shocks per patient , that 's a total cost to insurance companies and medicare of close to billion per year ect is big business in the old days , electric shock was provided using volt sine wave ac current coming more or less straight out of the wall socket , and people were indiscriminately subjected to needlessly high amounts of total charge modern protocols , properly conducted , involve titrating calibrating the patient s response to electricity , in recognition of the fact that the seizure threshold varies from individual to individual and by gender , as well women have a lower seizure threshold than men low dosage ect involves using an amount of electricity that is to times the seizure threshold for the patient in question high dosage ect might go as high as or more times the seizure threshold we re talking roughly volts and amps for up to six seconds , applied in square wave pulses this can hardly be called an innocuous amount of electricity it s a severe insult to the brain , and more than enough electricity to kill you if applied to the wrong parts of the body fda did its own systematic review of studies in and concluded , with regard to cognitive effects there is evidence for impairment in orientation , anterograde and retrograde memory , and global cognitive function immediately after ect that may last up to six months autobiographical memory is the most commonly reported memory impairment in these reviews there is limited evidence to suggest that the effects of ect on memory and cognitive function may not last more than six months note the peculiar wording of that last statement fda also had this to say immediately post ect , there are deficits across nearly all cognitive domains it should be noted that fda in its systematic review found an appalling shortage of controlled trials not many ect studies have a placebo or sham treatment arm in those that do , patients in the sham treatment group are counseled , anesthetized , and treated exactly the same as regular ect patients , but when they wake up from the procedure , they re told they ve been shocked , when in fact they haven t been the few sham controlled trials that have been published show a surprisingly high effectiveness of placebo sham shock therapy relative to ect in fact , one researcher colin a ross , m d , of the institute for psychological trauma in richardson , texas said the author reviewed the placebo controlled literature on electroconvulsive therapy ect for depression no study demonstrated a significant difference between real and placebo sham ect at month post treatment many studies failed to find a difference between real and sham ect even during the period of treatment claims in textbooks and review articles that ect is effective are not consistent with the published data a large , properly designed study of real versus sham ect should be undertaken in the absence of such a study , consent forms for ect should include statements that there is no controlled evidence demonstrating any benefit from ect at month post treatment consent forms should also state that real ect is only marginally more effective than placebo note the ross paper can be found online here for additional references to the literature , see this page fda found in its extensive review that during the one month following ect , about of patients showed evidence of benefit but also , amazingly , of people who received sham phony shock treatment exhibited evidence of benefit sham ect s effectiveness is not as high as true ect , but the difference may reflect blind breakage maybe only of sham ect patients were fooled the rest weren t because they didn t wake up dazed and confused , with weird muscle aches , and since they didn t believe they were shocked , they didn t get better the fact that sham ect works almost as well as ordinary ect raises the interesting possibility that it is the anesthesia , not the shock , that is providing most of the therapeutic benefit in ect a possibility that seems , incredibly , to have gone completely unnoticed by the same people who are now so vigorously promoting ketamine therapy for depression ketamine s primary medical use is as an anesthetic if you do your own reading on the subject , you may conclude as i have that ect s benefits are modest , at best perhaps no better than placebo , in the case of low dosage ect , and the risks unacceptable also , any therapeutic effect to the extent one exists is decidedly short lived fda s extensive literature search found the literature only supports effectiveness claims for ect for the time period immediately post ect to approximately one month there is little evidence supporting the effectiveness of ect beyond the one month time point because ect is a controversial treatment with no well accepted scientific explanation and the potential to cause long lasting harm in patients including death , i am going to devote several posts to this subject please join me over the next few days as we take a closer look at the literature on sham ect controlled studies in which people in the control arm were fooled into thinking they were shocked , statistics around ect and suicide , statistics on ect and death , and the evidence that ect causes brain damage if you or anyone you know might be contemplating ect , you owe it to yourself to read up on the facts meanwhile , you can find detailed discussions of this subject in my books hack your depression and of two minds i want to
