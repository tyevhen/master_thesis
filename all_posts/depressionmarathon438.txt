i have good news my energy level is improving ! as i noted here in previous posts , i have a recent history of significant fatigue , and i have been suffering mightily during my runs , even struggling to complete most of my long runs a couple of weeks ago , my doctor ordered blood tests , and we discovered my ferritin level was low ferritin is a protein found inside cells that stores iron the amount of ferritin in your blood serum ferritin level is directly related to the amount of iron stored in your body without iron , the blood cannot carry oxygen effectively , and you become fatigued easily that was exactly my experience i could n't figure out why , as a trained marathoner , i was becoming breathless while climbing one flight of stairs and i was getting really worried about my running it was consistently difficult ! the discovery of the low ferritin level was actually a relief my symptoms made sense , and it meant i was n't just an aging runner hitting the wall i began taking an iron supplement about days ago in my online research , i discovered it could take many months , anywhere from to , to restore my iron levels in the bone marrow i also read some running forums many runners reported it took several months for their energy and running to get back on track , too that concerned me , but at least i knew it was a fixable problem well , my running is getting easier already ! i had a class all day today , and i'm working tomorrow , so i did my long run this past thursday i went miles , and i felt good ! i finished easily ! i recovered well i was thrilled ! what a difference ten days make ! i certainly hope this is the beginning of the recovery of my energy and my running performance i'm planning a fast miler after work tomorrow that will be another good test , i think i'm so grateful my doctor believed what i was telling her and ordered those blood tests i'm so glad something so easily fixable was the cause of my symptoms and i'm really excited to be feeling more energized already i was prepared to wait the to months for resolution , but i gladly welcome these early signs of improvement ! i sure hope it continues
