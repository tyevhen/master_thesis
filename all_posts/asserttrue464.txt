if there 's one thing we know about longevity , it 's that the surest , safest way to get an organism to live longer is to subject it to a reduced calorie diet simply deprive an organism of food , not to the point of starvation of course but to the point where the organism has the minimal nutrition that will ensure healthy survival , and the organism will live longer often dramatically so in , clive mccay , mary crowell , and l a maynard published the first scientific report on this subject , noting that laboratory rats fed a severely calorie restricted diet lived up to twice as long as rats that ate ad libitum calorie restriction cr experiments have since been done with a wide variety of organisms the results have been dramatic , and highly reproducible across a broad range of species a decrease in caloric input of to invariably brings significant increases in the mean and maximum life spans of yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae , rotifers , nematodes caenorhabditis elegans , fruit flies drosophila melanogaster , medflies ceratitis capitata , spiders , fish guppies , zebrafish , rodents hamsters , rats , mice , dogs , and others as a side benefit , morbidity due to cancer , cardiovascular disease , diabetes , kidney disease , and autoimmune disease generally declines significantly in calorie restricted populations versus organisms allowed to eat ad libitum the longevity promoting effect of calorie restriction is so stark and obvious , across so many species lines , you would n't think anyone would doubt its applicability to humans for ethical reasons , a formal experiment has n't been run on humans , but two major studies are underway to see if the cr longevity effect holds true for primates one experiment is being conducted by the university of wisconsin madison the other is by the national institute on aging nia of the national institutes of health nih these studies began in and , respectively both projects involve rhesus monkeys macaca mulatta in a lab environment , the median life expectancy of rhesus monkeys is approximately years about survive beyond years maximum lifespan is roughly years in a study , ucla researchers divided mice into six groups the control group np was allowed to eat purina laboratory chow protein ad libitum all other groups ate carefully formulated diets , but in different amounts one group got kcal of food per week another got kcal wk , another got kcal with reduced protein , another got kcal wk starting from before weaning , and one group got kcal wk the respective survival curves for these groups are shown above each dot on each curve represents a death notice that no ad libitum animal lived beyond months almost a third of the kcal wk animals lived beyond months click to enlarge the rhesus monkey cr studies have shown mixed results so far the wisconsin group found that their calorie reduced monkeys definitely lived longer the nia group found no convincing evidence of life extension even though they noted four cr monkeys and one control from the old onset group have lived beyond years neither study is finished in the sense of all animals having died and some have questioned the nia protocol , inasmuch as the nia monkeys got a diet of carbohydrate , protein , and fat , which is essentially a high carb diet equivalent to eating ramen noodles a thorough and impartial third party overview of existing primate work including not only the nia and wisconsin studies but a handful of others can be found in calorie restriction and aging in nonhuman primates by joseph w kemnitz , ilar j february but do we really have to run experiments like this on monkeys to see if the cr longevity effect applies to humans ? anecdotally , we all know there are no year old sumo wrestlers we also know it 's unlikely scientists will discover an uncharted village , high above the tree line in the andes , where year old village elders angrily throw still smoldering cigar butts at their pregnant year old wives for not smearing enough extra icing on their cinnabons in the blue zones that have been studied so far , there 's one constant low body mass index the japanese district of okinawa has the longest average lifespan in the world and the highest documented percentage of centenarians people living beyond consistent with cr experiments in animals , okinawans eat around fewer calories than americans and fewer calories than the japanese average the caloric intake of okinawan children is below the japanese recommended intake the typical adult bmi body mass index is to for a five foot nine inch man , that 's a weight of to pounds no one rides a scootie to mcdonalds blue zoners not only do n't eat much , they treat meat as poison , although in sardinia , the natives sometimes eat pecorino , a special cheese made from special milk from special sheep that graze on special grass this cheese is said to have super high concentrations of cla conjugated linoleic acid , a particular omega fatty acid this photograph was not taken in okinawa most blue zoners are religious or at least highly spiritual , but in the costa rican blue zone , adultery runs as high as obviously these people are outliers adultery correlates with early mortality in most cultures it also helps to have good genes , of course and most blue zones are genetically isolated hence probably share a lot of good genes but longevity is currently thought to be no more than genetic when it comes to living a long life , it 's mostly what you do with your body that matters , not what you 're born with bottom line , we already know that overweight not just obesity , but overweight is positively correlated with type diabetes , hypertension , stroke , coronary artery disease , pulmonary embolism , asthma , chronic back ailments , osteoarthritis and related hip and knee replacement , gallbladder disease , obstructive sleep apnia , colorectal cancer , kidney cancer , pancreatic cancer , endometrial cancer , ovarian cancer , and post menopausal breast cancer every day , we see the results of the struggle between cr and longevity , in real people , right in front of us , in real time we see human beings eating ad libitum , at mcdonalds and elsewhere , every day those are the control group remember , in the animal studies , the control group individuals are those who are allowed to eat ad libitum the cr studies all say the same thing you can live a long time , or you can eat ad libitum not both the starting point for longer life expectancy is n't to put more money into cancer research it 's to put less food in your mouth it 's that simple and that hard
