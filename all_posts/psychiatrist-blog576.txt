i'm still dwelling on these discussions we 've had about the inpatient experience a number of readers commented that they were n't like other patients on the ward who were n't educated , who used drugs and were in and out of jail i took that a little personally since those other inpatients are my correctional patients i like working with them and i do n't like it when people dismiss them as being just criminals i also found it a bit ironic that the people who are quick to claim peer kinship with staff are also quick to disclaim equality with forensic patients you really ca n't have it both ways my offender patients deserve to be taken seriously , treated with respect and given humane care whether you want them in your community or not i do n't like the idea of framing treatment in terms of who is more 'deserving' of care i do n't think you can put a rating scale on suffering or prioritize trauma nevertheless , when it comes to the spectrum and amount of services that are needed my forensic patients are right up there they may not be very literate , they 've got poor social supports as well as mental health and addiction problems oh , and chronic medical problems that go untreated because they have no insurance they 're facing an uphill battle just to reach a normal place in society for my patients , success means having a place to live , a job , people who care about them , maybe even a car and a girlfriend that 's a lot to have when you 're starting at zero yet when it comes to apportioning services and access to treatment these are the first folks to get cut some inpatient units do have patients of privilege people who are n't starting at zero and these patients really do seem rich figuratively and literally in comparison but forensic patients are increasingly part of our mental health care system when we talk about making the system better they have to be part of that discussion
