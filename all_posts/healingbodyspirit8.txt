we are spirit children of god and could not progress without obtaining a body we had to come to earth to gain a body and knew we would have to face trials here on earth just as diamonds are forged and polished with trials and adversity , we knew we would face trials and chose to do so we were promised if we did this well we could obtain eternal life we were eager to do this and some chose more trials than others we are children of god on a divinely appointed earthly mission n and that mission was assigned to us by god he has promised he will not leave us comfortless and he would guide us and help us he has promised us peace not as the world giveth peace , but as he can give he loves each of us reach out and touch hold of the hem of the garment of christ and feel virtue healing flow through you if you are depressed or ill , visualize doing this
