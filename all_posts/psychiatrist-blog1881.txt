practice ha ! how did you think i was going to finish that question ? first , let me say that it 's heartening to know there are folks out there googling ways to manipulate their psychiatrists , this warms my shrinky little heart this post , however , is on practice coverage , meaning how do we tell patients to reach us in an emergency , what happens when we 're away mostly , i'm talking about private practice , because clinics usually have after hours coverage through an agency in baltimore , there 's a group called the baltimore crisis response hotline , an emergency room , or an elaborate coverage arrangement with docs social workers in an on call deal clinkshrink seems to be on constant call for her places of employment and has gone years at a time without a vacation this , i believe , is its own mental health issue , but she does n't pay me , so i will stay silent roy just works all the time , but he does go on vacation neither of them have private practices , at least not now , so my frame of reference is non systematic , non scientific , non evidence based you do n't have to read this and please do n't talk about it to the fda so this is the range i 've noticed most private practice psychiatrists have machines that answer after hours , not answering services they range in their instructions some say if this is an emergency , call or go to the er this is coverage ? ? at the other extreme , there are those docs who have a designated cell phone that they keep on all the time and their messages instruct you to call that , or a home phone number for after hours emergencies my good friend camel has such a line and her machine says , if this is a life or death emergency , call the good thing about having this kind of messages is that it 's a lot of fun to have your friends tease you about the life and death line i , of course , would never do this no one ever tells you what a psychiatric emergency actually is , and after years of practice , i'm still not sure i know so what do i do ? my office number is my cell phone , much easier than leaving a list of where you can reach me when on the first visit , i tell patients , it goes where i go i turn it off during sessions , and i am essentially unreachable essentially , because the babysitter once knocked on my door , my kid in hand , to say i 'd locked her out of the house oops but generally , i'm not accessible , and i check my messages between sessions i turn the phone off when i'm anywhere i ca n't talk privately , so you wo n't hear me yelling take more xanax ! over the bing bing of the cashier at the grocery store , or the yelps of those happy ravens fans oh , i do n't prescribe xanax , but that 's another post , perhaps one for the last psychiatrist who is fond of that topic today i turn the phone off while i sleep , so it 's fine to leave a message at any hour of the day or night if you need me in the middle of the night and really , i do mean need , i give out my home phone number as part of a written sheet of office policies and contact information this is all , i believe , a few steps beyond go to the er , but it 's not as available as a willingness to take an emergency call anywhere , anytime with the promise that i will answer all calls on the spot one could imagine all sorts of interest places to rest that life or death line , careful where you roll , honey for me , it 's a blend of what i can comfortably live with and still feel like i make myself available i once consultant 's on a patient who was appalled that his psychiatrist had taken three hours to return his call when he was having a panic attack i felt for both the patient and his doctor , but i could n't reassure him that i would be instantly available either what about vacation coverage ? i just came back from one of those , i highly recommend them i asked two other psychiatrists to cover my practice my patients rarely want much while i'm gone refills sometimes , otherwise they leave messages for me and do n't seem to want to talk to a stranger i post the other docs numbers on my machine , turn off my cell phone , and trust that my practice is in good hands i do n't leave charts , i do n't leave instructions unless there is someone specific i'm very worried about and that person simply never calls , i often do leave a contact number or email address where i can be reached , but i 'd prefer not to know there 've been no fiascos , though one doc did insist on meeting with one of my patients before he 'd refill a medicine she 'd been on for years logistically , it was inconvenient for her , but she seemed to enjoy meeting him from my end , i was perplexed as to why they met i generally refill existing medications over the phone once i 've verified with the pharmacy that dr x really has been prescribing this for the patient in an ongoing manner patient was n't sure if dr x would have filled the script without meeting first , and dr x wanted a signed faxed release to discuss this with me life felt complicated , i just let it go , and i will mention that dr x continues to be my respected friend the bets are out as to whether i 'll steer him towards this post most of the time , things just go smoothly sometimes patients tell me their doc is away and there is no coverage can that be ? seems sort odd there is probably somewhere a standard of care document that dictates these things i'm hedging my bets that ignorance may be more peaceful by all means , chime in with your thoughts !
