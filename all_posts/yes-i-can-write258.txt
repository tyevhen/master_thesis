it says something about the hippie upbringing i 've had that every time i see someone walk past with their baby balanced on their hip , struggling to juggle their shopping bags or open a door , i think why are n't they wearing a sling ? it would be so much easier ! and every time i see a baby being bottle fed , i shudder , thinking how much better healthier cheaper more convenient breastfeeding is before someone feels a need to tell me that some people are unable to breastfeed , i realize that but the fact remains that the great majority simply choose not to ! i grew up surrounded by lots of granola hippie homeschooling moms babywearing and breastfeeding and co sleeping have always been what 's normal to me , and i find myself surprised at how abnormal those things are to much of the population ! so many people think breastfeeding is gross , co sleeping dangerous , and so many people do n't seem to even know about the existence of babywearing instead , what 's normal to most people is formula in plastic bottles strollers and carry able seats disposable diapers and cribs all so artificial , and so removed ! the world is a strange and sad place when that 's what 's considered normal continuing in the same vein , i found this video recently , of art from all over the world depicting the baby jesus nursing i'm not christian in the slightest , but that did n't make me find this art , or what it says about the cultures that created it , any less lovely from the blog , peaceful parenting , that created this video images of mary breastfeeding jesus were once ubiquitous in churches around the world but eventually in north america , as the artificial feeding of babies became more popular , and the plastic bottle replaced the breast , our nipplephobia got the best of us and these sacred images all but disappeared from churches and art galleries in north america enjoy ! peace , idzie you might also like review of for the sake of our children my rather unconventional views earth day cuddly cats and problems with life goals linkwithin
