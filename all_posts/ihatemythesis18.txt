a couple weeks ago , when i was doing my lit review questions , i got really really stuck my adviser wanted me to incorporate more theorists into my argument , and i simply did not know of any theorists other than the ones i 'd already incorporated have you ever been there ? it 's an unhappy place to be i searched high and low and hit the university library and library web site a few times all to no avail but then , at the last minute , the luxuries of consumerism saved me amazon com no , i did n't find some new method to cheat i just discovered its highly developed search engine that because amazon has a profit motive , whereas the university library does not actually succeeds in helping me find things here 's what i did hopefully , it can help you too i typed the name of my one known theorist into amazon i scrolled down to the other people bought these books too section i found the mother lode of relevant yet previously elusive theorists i opened a new browser tab and typed name of new people into school library search engine bingo free books ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! really , it was like magic all my problems were solved marx may hate me , but this system combines the best of consumerism user friendly products with the best of socialism free stuff the only thing you have to watch out for is back strain i found such a trove of research that i filled my camping backpack twice remember to lift with your kness and not with your back , and happy studying ! note camera phone photo of my first batch of library books all set up neatly in a library study corral speaking of which , that 's another great thing about libraries free study space no purchase of a coffee required
