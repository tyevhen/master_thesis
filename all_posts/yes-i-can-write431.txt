not much is going on really i added links to my other blogs in the sidebar of this blog , and it took me far more effort than it should have being the silly that i am , i did n't realize i could add links by simply adding a 'links list' gadget , so instead had emy spend half an hour trying to figure out the xml using her limited knowledge of html that she has n't used in years i think she was ready to smack me when i discovered the links gadget i also changed the template for my trash blog , to one i found on a blog template site recommended to me by sheila , which is really cool i'm also still really looking forward to using my new camera see below post ! something i 've been thinking a lot about lately is how people treat their pets , and how i specifically treat the animals i share my house with and i'm not really happy with how i treat them i'm trying to be more respectful , to keep my temper even when winston pound airedale terrier wo n't stop headbutting me in the back of the knees , or flora bouncy little fox terrier wo n't stop yapping that 's a hard thing to do but i think i'm making headway ! winston especially is really stubborn , and when you yell at him , it does n't always even work it seems if i ask him nicely to do something , he actually does it a bit faster ! and i 've been trying to be more respectful with the cats too instead of randomly cuddling them without seeing if they want to be cuddled first , i 've been sitting or lying next to them and just talking if they want cuddles , they get up and move closer i think we 're both happier that way and now for a vegan update i went vegan a couple of weeks ago , and at this point i'm finding it harder than expected the big stuff is n't bad it 's not really hard to avoid straight milk , cheese , and eggs , but i never realized how many things have dairy or eggs in them ! ! baked goods , candy , pasta sauces , other sauces , chips , crackers and the list goes on ! i ate a piece of toffee today that had butter in it , even though i knew it had butter in it , and now i'm feeling guilty that i'm not feeling guilty arrrg ! i think that when this month is up , i'm going back to vegetarian however , i am glad that i'm doing this it 's really made me think about what i eat in a new way , and i do n't think i'm going to be consuming nearly as many animal products as i was milk on cereal is something i'm not doing anymore hey , good soymilk tastes the same anyway , ice cream always makes me feel sick unless it 's good stuff like ben jerry 's so i'm cutting that out yes , even though it made me feel sick i 'd still eat it sometimes , eggs dito , and olive oil tastes better than butter anyway so all i 'll really be going back to eating are all the things i'm currently avoiding that have just a tiny bit of dairy or eggs in them , or baked goods and now i'm off to make supper i have n't really been cooking much , so i think i should tonight i'm going to use the canned base of a roasted garlic and red pepper sauce , then add sauteed onions , black and green olives , and baked spinach and jalapeno tofu pieces and i 'll serve that over twirly pasta of some sort i think i should find out if i'm cooking for just me or everyone now peace idzie you might also like several things of note vegetarianism vegan for a month , at least this year in life including dogs , trips , zines and glasses linkwithin
