in an earlier post , i mentioned the slide that is something i dread another little frustration is waking up feeling weaker fortunately , it does not happen often , but when it happens , you do not know whether you are beginning the dreaded slide , or just having a bad day thursday morning was one of those days i noticed it immediately when trying to stand up from the commode i had to struggle a little more than normal then , when trying to stand up from my chair , i almost did not make it it was very cold that morning degrees and my hands were not working well either after i came back from walking fred , i just could not stand upright without help my exercise program was also more difficult than usual throughout the rest of the morning , i found it difficult to stand up or remain standing at times i had to lean way over my legs and grab onto something in front of me until i could finally stand upright frustrating and a little dangerous to add to it , my arms and legs were also aching all day on days like these , i need a couple extra of inches of padding to raise my seat height to ease my effort to stand up this morning was again very cold i am still weak , but , fortunately , not as bad off as yesterday i still do not feel confident standing i feel like an accident waiting to happen complain complain a little more and complain one more time so you know i am serious as long as it is just an anomaly , i can handle it unfortunately , whether i can handle it or not does not matter , because it happens i just need to suck it up , adjust my routines accordingly , and get on with life now i realize that so much of what happens and how i feel should not affect my attitude , but it often does there are times where i just want to tell someone what a cruddy day i am having i realize that no matter what i do or say is not going to make any difference , but it just feels good to get it off my chest there , i feel better already
