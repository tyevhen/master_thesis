as anticipated , i left the hospital yesterday after days on the inpatient psych unit my social worker gave me a ride home where i unpacked and repacked i 'd worn the same few things for the past days , and i wanted nothing to do with those clothes anymore i repacked my suitcase in order to go to my friends house where i will stay for the duration of my outpatient ect as usual , my friends bill and cindy are stepping up and taking good care of me i spent my first night here last night it 's just me and bill for now , as cindy is out of town unfortunately , the first night did n't go too well i felt anxious and empty during the evening and for the second time in the past days , i cried myself to sleep i was incredibly sad i do n't know why the sadness just welled up from deep within , and i could n't stop crying today , the sadness and emptiness remains , and it has me quite distressed i saw my psychiatrist this morning she reassured me that sometimes , even after ect treatments , some patients do not notice an improvement she told me it does n't mean i wo n't improve , that i still could respond to the treatments remaining at this point , it looks like i will be doing treatments rather than the for which i had hoped i wish i felt as confident as my psychiatrist that things will improve the reality is i'm scared i do n't know things are going to improve nobody does that scares me there is no timetable to this illness it does n't have a nice beginning , middle and end it waxes and wanes , comes and goes , usually on its own schedule and certainly not on mine as i mentioned previously , the longer this episode goes unchecked the more hopeless , helpless , and discouraged i feel i'm attacking it from every angle , and still i'm not improving that 's frightening i'm not sure what else i can do
