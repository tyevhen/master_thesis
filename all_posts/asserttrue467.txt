obesity rates began trending sharply higher in coincidentally , was the year of the first dietary guidelines for americans by the department of health and human services recently , i wrote about the fact that if we could eliminate all heart disease and all cancer overnight , human life expectancy would increase only slightly just years if heart disease is eliminated , years if cancer is eradicated those are cdc 's numbers it seems clear that to extend life expectancies much beyond , say , years will require more than merely eliminating the most common causes of death it will require re engineering the human body to be a good deal more robust in terms of its self repair capabilities in my previous post , i hinted at the fact that today , it takes a much larger change in mortality rates to move the life expectancy needle than it used to the non straightforward relationship of life expectancy delta to mortality rate delta is modeled in terms of something called keyfitz entropy , and the strange diminishing returns effect has been called taeuber 's paradox after public health researcher conrad taeuber if you 'd like more background on this , i suggest you start with the science article by olshansky et al prospects for human longevity which shows that , because of keyfitz taeuber effects , it 's unlikely the u s , at its current rate of mortality progress , will see year life expectancies until the year for women or for men over the short term , i remain quite pessimistic dreamers like ray kurzweil are predicting immortality by my prediction is quite different in the united states , we should expect to see life expectancies peaking right about now and start trending downward by , based mostly on the sudden jump in obesity that began in and the doubling of diabetes in the last years some of adult americans are obese and another are overweight but not obese the numbers for children are starting to approach those for adults and we 're continuing to trend sharply in the wrong direction this will show up as an unwelcome drop in life expectancy when all the follow on effects of epidemic obesity and diabetes begin to be realized it 's important to note that overweight is a predictor of type diabetes hypertension stroke coronary artery disease pulmonary embolism asthma chronic back ailments osteoarthritis and related hip and knee replacement gallbladder disease obstructive sleep apnia colorectal cancer kidney cancer pancreatic cancer endometrial cancer ovarian cancer post menopausal breast cancer those are just the possible somatic outcomes psychiatric comorbidity is also extremely common with obesity and with chronic illness of any kind smoking has been on the decline for decades but is starting to level off at around of the u s population heart disease has decreased in parallel with the decades long drop in tobacco consumption although lung cancer rates , for some unknown reason , have merely leveled off and not gone down there are some important lessons to be learned here existing public policy efforts in combating obesity have been , and continue to be , an abject failure weight gain in the u s is out of control , across most demographics , including young children a sharp increase in rate of weight gain started around the change in slope after does n't correspond to a sharp increase in tv watching , online gaming , or many of the other entirely speculative causal factors usually cited for obesity there have n't been any sharp increases in causal factors other than calorie intake obesity is a proven risk factor for at least serious illness types not counting the adverse outcomes associated with diabetes because of the lead time required for these diseases to develop , we have not yet begun to see the full impact of the increase in the rate of weight gain much of the progress made against heart disease over the last years has been driven by reduced cigaret smoking but smoking rates are leveling off now at around and are n't likely to go much lower , for a variety of reasons most of the low hanging fruit , in heart disease and cancer prevention , has already been picked we should n't expect dramatic lowering of the mortality rates for heart disease or cancer the no and no causes of death going forward when obesity knock on effects still in the pipeline show up as increased mortality from diabetes , stroke , heart attack , cancer , etc , life expectancy in the u s will actually start going down it should be obvious that the single most important thing we can do right now to increase overall life expectancy in the u s is to get people to lose weight and teach their children to eat right for a lot of reasons , i'm pessimistic on both of those corporations have no incentive to make children want to eat right parents are n't doing the job current public health policies are n't doing the job and it 's politically unpopular in the u s right now to have the government step in with meaningful social programs in upcoming posts , i want to switch gears and start talking about the molecular biology of aging and the sorts of things we can do now not years from now to extend life expectancy by , , or more stay tuned for details
