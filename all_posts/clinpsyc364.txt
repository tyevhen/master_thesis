background there has been prior mention of how zyprexa was allegedly marketed off label as a treatment for dementia , including writing by alex berenson this post will provide more details regarding this issue , especially about the hypothetical case of martha , a case used by lilly sales representatives in their meetings with physicians before reading this piece , please note that lilly has denied that it markets its products off label martha s symptoms have been described as much more strongly resembling dementia than either schizophrenia or bipolar , the only two indications for which zyprexa is fda approved according to alex berenson , martha was described as a widow with adult children who lives independently and has been your patient for some time martha was described as being agitated and having disturbed sleep , but without the symptoms of paranoia or mania that typically marked a person with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder berenson noted that a lilly spokesperson said that martha was intended to represent a patient with schizophrenia more on martha here is more on martha , perhaps from the same document examined by berenson this document is titled zyprexa olanzapine primary care q implementation guide , and it is dated june this is martha martha is a widow who lives independently and has been your patient for some time she is becoming more complicated to manage , and you note increasing agitation her sleep is disturbed she dozes during the day and is up most of the night her family has shared their concerns with you , saying , she thinks we re trying to take advantage of her martha s family doesn t want to send her to a nursing home , but her agitation and confusion must be addressed your goals of treatment for martha may include reducing her behavioral disturbances without impairing her cognitive functioning does martha have schizophrenia ? upon checking the diagnostic and statistical manual for mental disorders , fourth edition , text revision dsm iv tr criteria for schizophrenia , it appears that martha does not meet the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia , despite lilly s claims that martha was intended to represent a patient with schizophrenia later , the same document discusses possible zyprexa dosage for martha a starting dose of mg or even mg at bedtime is appropriate in schizophrenia trials , zyprexa is typically dosed at mg , not mg mg this also apparently contradicts lilly s claim that it was intending martha to represent a patient with schizophrenia , as it would make little sense for lilly to recommend a subtherapeutic dose of zyprexa to physicians under the heading of back cover close , it is stated in summary , doctor , prescribing zyprexa is a safe , proven solution for patients like martha michael kelly who suffer with mood , thought , and behavioral disturbances it s easy to use , and it works emphasis in original again , note the broad terminology rather than discussing bipolar disorder or schizophrenia , for which zyprexa is indicated , the language of mood , thought , and behavioral disturbances is in place , which suggests much a broader application of zyprexa in the same document , a potential question that reps may receive from doctors is mentioned with martha i would just prescribe a cholinesterase inhibitor , such as aricept they are supposed to be pretty good with agitation rep why not prescribe zyprexa , which has proven efficacy for agitation and related behavioral disturbances my emphasis , has been on the market for more than years , and has helped over million patients with symptoms just like martha s ? in the case of martha , note again that schizophrenia is not mentioned instead , agitation and related behavioral disturbances are brought to the fore fda indication for dementia ? in the same document , under the heading of helpful hints , subheading titled martha spread , it is stated that you will note that on the right hand side of the spread under the cognition information is a space that has been intentionally left open upon launch of the im intramuscular formulation of zyprexa , we will be placing a sticker in this spot to announce the new formulation and new indication agitation associated with dementia my emphasis zyprexa was never approved by the fda for the treatment of dementia , though it would appear from the above quote that lilly was expecting such approval email message to shed further light on the possible off label promotion of zyprexa for dementia , further documents were reviewed , including an email issued to area zyprexa champions , since the diagnosis of our patients in the zyprexa core message piece are martha dementia , my emphasis can you enlighten us a little more about dementia we know that we are to describe the symptoms and stay away from diagnoses , but for our own background , can you elaborate on dementia we are getting a little grief from some of our docs about promoting zyprexa for dementia my emphasis , but according to the slides in the audioconference set , there is no fda approved drug for dementia this email clearly indicates that at least some individuals at lilly were seeing martha as a case of dementia and that some doctors seemed upset about zyprexa being promoted for dementia martha s symptoms increase as she ages another document , titled zyprexa retail implementation guide states under the heading sales call , subheading patient profile martha is a widow you ve known and treated for several years as she s aged , she s become more complicated to manage clinically , and at home these are comments you hear from her family read testimonials from profile your main goal of treatment is to treat her illness and reduce her behavioral disturbances do you see patients like martha ? the comment of her becoming more complicated to manage as she s grown older sounds much more reminiscent of dementia than of schizophrenia , as with schizophrenia , symptom severity is often rather clear at a relatively young age twenties and thirties and does not necessarily worsen over time summary all told , the documents i reviewed appear to paint a picture of martha being described as a patient with dementia her case was then apparently to be described to physicians in primary care settings in an attempt to open their minds to prescribing zyprexa martha s symptoms do not seem related to schizophrenia rather , they seem to more strongly resemble symptoms of dementia in addition , an email indicated that at least some lilly employees thought of martha as a patient with dementia and that some physicians were upset that they perceived zyprexa was being marketed for dementia for more on the story of zyprexa s marketing , please see the following , , , disclaimer please note that i am not equipped to state whether lilly s marketing practices regarding zyprexa were illegal , as the law seems to be pretty unclear on this point of course , whether a practice is legal and whether it is ethical are two different things
