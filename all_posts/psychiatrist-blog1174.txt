a psychiatrist colleague is learning to do cognitive behavioral therapy he 's treating a patient with agoraphobia , and goes to the patient 's home to work with the patient on slowly coming out of his comfort zone it got me thinking about treating patients in their homes , or in places other than the office i 've been to the homes of patients a few times none were my on going therapy patients as a resident , i rotated through an outreach team these teams provide treatment to people with severe and persistent mental illnesses who have a history of non compliance these patients do n't keep their appointments , and they repeatedly get sick and end up in the hospital , sometimes many , many times as the doctor on the team , i never went alone , always with a nurse or social worker who knew the patient , and mostly i was an observer it was a great experience as a clinic medical director , i went with our case manager a few times to see patients she was worried about so i'm thinking about the colleague who visits the patient in his home to help him negotiate the world is this a feasible way of treating people ? the psychiatrist stays for an hour , and there 's transportation time i do n't know how long that takes so financially , this could be an expensive endeavor in this case , i believe the doc is salaried , and the patient is being seen pro bono as part of the learning experience and what about the boundary issues involved in being in a patient 's home ? i'm writing without really having a point i want to make does anyone else do home visit psychiatry and what thoughts can you share ?
