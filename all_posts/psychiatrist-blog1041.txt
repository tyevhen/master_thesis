roy has electronic medical records on his mind lately and if you 'd like to hear him , oh , he 'd love to tell you his thoughts or read his last post here i'm still not sure how i feel about electronic records i worry about confidentiality and the propagation of incorrect information so why are medical records oh so important ? what about making other important things into electronic records so that information can be shared and referred to ? never mind electronic medical records , what i need are electronic hair records ! hair , you ask ? hair ! let me tell you about my hair i am a user of hair chemicals and it 's no picnic when i'm away and need an emergency procedure what could electronic hair records do ? well there was the two year period where i saw a very nice hair dresser and somehow my hair was always too light i had her switch chemical brands , but to no avail finally , i switched salons , and my hair is darker there was the time that i wanted to have a chemical procedure done with a gift certificate at another salon and was told that if i 'd had a certain process done previously , my hair might break off or fall out if there was an ehairr , my hair dresser could have checked this instead we had to call my home salon and determined that it was n't safe my hair , indeed , could have fallen out oh , and because of all the processes , i must use a sulphate free shampoo no ehairr i have to be the one to remind the shampoo person of this issue each and every time no one even asks so what could an electronic hair record do ? keep track of all chemical processes , brand names , colors , and dates of application coordinate dates of chemical processes to prevent interactions include panoramic photos of all haircuts so that patron could walk in and say , i liked the way it looked after the last cut and that cut could be reviewed include standardization of lengths bangs to a half inch above the eyebrows would be precise for those with thinning hair or balding , track hair loss include computer generated growth photos to help schedule haircuts with important life events download onto a iphone app so the patron could , at last , own their own ehairr ! compare costs and ratings for different salons and hairdressers i think i'm on to something here
