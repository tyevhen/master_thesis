novell has decided to donate its high performance flaim database engine and the xml savvy version , xflaim to open source flaim is not new and is not meant to compete with mysql it 's a platform neutral , massively scalable , very high performance transactional database , written in c as a persistence back end for novell edirectory it is also used in groupwise the xflaim version uses xpath for a query language the fact that there are novell customers with well over million objects in their flaim backed edirectory trees should tell you how scalable and robust the flaim technology is it should be robust , after nearly years of development ! if you want to get a feel for what xflaim is all about given that i ca n't do it justice here , go to the documentation is this novell 's first step toward open sourcing edirectory ? quite honestly , i do n't know if i did know , i could n't write about it here
