this post similar to a previous post centers on a study for risperidone as an add on to ssri treatment for depression the current post focuses on the failure of some authors to disclose their conflicts of interest when the advance online publication of the article is examined , the only author listing any financial support is lead author mark hyman rapaport , who lists four grants and a chairmanship janssen funded the study according to an earlier abstract version of the study , so it is curious that rapaport did not list janssen as a financial supporter rapaport was not alone in his failure to disclose nemeroff the last author and keller fifth author clearly had conflicting interests that should have been declared let s start with nemeroff he is the editor of the journal neuropsychopharmacology in which this article appeared , so he should be familiar with the journal 's conflict of interest policy , which states in part at the time of submission , each author must disclose any involvement , financial or otherwise , that might potentially bias their work the information should be listed in the acknowledgements that appear at the end of the manuscript and noted in the authors cover letter the policy is pretty clear so does nemeroff have a significant conflict of interest in this case ? in the journal of clinical psychiatry supplement from , the conflicts of interest section mentions that , among nemeroff s quite numerous funding sources , nemeroff has received grant research support from janssen , is a consultant for janssen , and is a member of the speakers bureau for you guessed it janssen , which is the company marketing risperdal in the same supplement , which was derived from a planning roundtable supported by an educational grant from janssen medical affairs , nemeroff penned a review article that reflected favorably upon risperidone , as well as some other drugs so it s pretty clear that there was a conflict of interest here it s just that editor nemeroff did not enforce his journal s policies upon himself of course , this is not the first time such behavior has occurred you can read about a similar failure to enforce editorial policies involving nemeroff here and here but wait , there s more ! nemeroff actually violated another of his journal s policies , the one about duplicate publication of data on the neuropsychopharmacology author instructions page , right under nemeroff s name as editor of the journal , you can see the following submission is a representation that neither the manuscript nor its data have been previously published except in abstract or are currently under consideration for publication nemeroff , in the aforementioned journal of clinical psychiatry supplement wrote no less than five paragraphs describing the risperidone add on study s data , which was later published in neuropsychopharmacology so neuropsychopharmacology s editorial policy is that study data should not have been published earlier except in abstract form , but nemeroff wrote about it for much longer than an abstract in a supplement paid for by janssen , yet felt free to flout editorial policy regarding prior publication this , of course , comes in addition to an egregious failure to disclose conflicts of interest what is the penalty for such behavior , one might ask ? an accusation that an editor has violated the conflict of interest policy shall be referred to the acnp ethics committee for consideration and investigation the ethics committee shall report its findings and recommendations to the publications committee and council for action an editor found guilty of violating the conflict of interest policy is subject to sanction , including forfeiture of the editorship don t worry nemeroff is one step ahead of the game here he chose to resign his editorship over the previous scandal involving his pimping of vagus nerve stimulation therapy , which you can feel free to read about here no , nemeroff did not state that he was leaving the editor position as a result of the vns debacle , but the timing seems to reflect more than a coincidence to summarize briefly , nemeroff had a blatant conflict of interest which he did not declare he is also the editor of the journal in which the article appeared where he did not disclose the coi in addition , he ignored his journal s prohibition on prior publication of data as the editor , he should obviously know much better indeed , it is difficult to believe that this was an oversight it appears that nemeroff was playing the role of marketer for risperidone as opposed to carrying out his duties as an editor how about martin keller ? in that same supplement of the journal of clinical psychiatry mentioned above , keller is listed as having received honoraria from janssen and as being an advisory board member for janssen keep in mind that whatever work he conducted at the planning roundtable upon which the supplement was based was also funded by janssen yet no mention of any financial support from janssen is provided in the neuropsychopharmacology article apparently , perhaps due to nemeroff s earlier brush with the spotlight regarding his marketing of vns therapy in the journal in which he edits an article in which blatant conflicts of interest were not disclosed , the authors thought better of the conflict of interest issue a corrigendum correction is displayed in the november print edition of neuropsychopharmacology that lists disclosures for nemeroff , keller , and rapaport but if you are obtaining the article through online access which is likely true for most people , then you won t find the correction because it is not included in the pages of the article eventually the correction will be picked up on medline , but many readers will not notice it add the failure to disclose conflicts of interest to the shifting authorship line mentioned earlier and you can see why i am feeling a little skeptical of course , given some of nemeroff s past ethical issues here and here , this is not entirely surprising the last chapter in this tale , regarding the risperidone augmentation study s data analysis will be told shortly
