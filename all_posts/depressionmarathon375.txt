i 've slept in my own bed for two nights now my mom is staying with me for a few days i'm trying to get back into some sort of a routine i ran miles yesterday and paid my overdue bills today i took jet out for a walk with a friend i went grocery shopping with my mom , and she spent the rest of the day making some food to fill my freezer for the winter months my mom turned the spoiled bananas into some fabulous banana bread , with chocolate chips , just the way i like it on the stove top at the moment is some wonderful split pea and ham soup , which we all ate for dinner and i will now pack in multiple freezer containers for the months down the road tomorrow , we 've got spaghetti sauce on the menu i look forward to eating that throughout the winter months , too my mom cooked like this for me last fall , as well being the non cook that i am , it 's really nice to pull something homemade out of the freezer in the middle of january she might be spoiling me just a bit , but i'm okay with that ! as far as my mood goes , i'm not sure it 's much improved i'm glad to be out of the hospital i'm glad to be in my own home but i'm still feeling low i'm still feeling hopeless i have not totally turned the corner i know that i am not out of the woods yet despite understanding that fact , i have made some decisions regarding my treatment i 've decided i am not going to do anymore ect treatments , because the loss of memory side effect is just too severe and too scary for me to deal with any longer i feel confused as to how i ended up in the hospital i do n't recall the events leading up to either of my recent hospitalizations , and that is as a direct result of ect ect erases history i feel like i 've been dropped into today being dropped into a day , with no understanding of how i got there , is very disconcerting it 's unsettling it 's confusing there 's no past on which to base my current state of being i do n't like it i feel really , really stupid i'm not stupid , but if you were around me for more than an hour , you might think i was it 's that bad ect makes me stupid for that reason , i'm hoping to get the rest of the way through this episode without ect hopefully medication adjustments and time will be what i need to heal until then , i'm trying my best to settle into home , return to a routine , get back to running , and eventually return to work that 's the plan i'm tired now depression wears me down , but i 'd rather be worn down and on my way to my own bed than on my way to a hospital bed any day of the week and that 's where i'm off to right now , my own bed good night
