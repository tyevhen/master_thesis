i was n't entirely satisfied with my post on boxes to start with , and then michele who 's blog is awesome , by the way brought up a good point , so i figured i 'd add a bit to my original post it 's true that labels can be useful for instance , i call myself an unschooling vegetarian pagan anarchist hippie or my new version , an unschooling soon to be vegan animistic green anarchist hippie in the hopes that people will get at least a bit of an idea of what i believe in , what my world view is that said , i do n't want anyone to base how they treat me on that i want them to base their treatment of me on me ! that was my big point by putting people in boxes , people often treat those people a certain way , based not on who they are as a person , but on what box they fit them into does that make sense ? i think that whatever labels seem to fit a person , whatever box they 're put into , that should be far less important than who they are as a person hmm i still do n't feel like i'm saying this right i do n't want people to not talk about controlling schooling methods to me because i'm an unschooler , i do , however , not want them to talk about controlling schooling methods to me because it bothers me personally by saying i'm an unschooler i let people know that it would probably bother me if people talk about coercive parenting or schooling to me , and this is what michele was saying , but it 's not the label that 's important , it 's my feelings about the subject there , i think that 's a better way of putting what i meant peace , idzie you might also like boxes , how i hate thee fall days and new writing an interesting excert the frustration of being that unschooled person linkwithin
