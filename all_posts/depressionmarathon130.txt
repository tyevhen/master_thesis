my official week new york city marathon training schedule began monday , july th i'm not yet back on the road , but i'm getting closer today i ran on the alter g treadmill for minutes at of my body weight i ran at of my body weight for minutes and then increased the percentage to for the final minutes it was the first time i ran at and it went well i saw my orthopedic doctor right after my run , and he 's pleased with my progress more importantly , i'm pleased with my progress my achilles responded well to the increased demand i have a couple more treadmill runs scheduled if things continue to go okay , i'm hoping to be back on the road for my first run by late next week my first run as i wrote that sentence , the anxiety rose up within me i'm cautiously optimistic i will be back to running soon , but i'm also worried actually , i'm scared i 've come so far i 've got so much emotional baggage attached to this now month injury healing process fifteen months whew it 's been a long , long road i'm hoping the road is about to come to an end i have faith i will handle whatever next comes my way , whether i like it or not of course , i really hope i like what 's on the horizon the thing is , at this point it really is out of my hands as my doctor said today , we did the best we could in our treatment and rehabilitation there is nothing else we could have done to increase the likelihood of a positive outcome i 've taken it slow i 've followed recommendations i 've patiently worked toward what comes next , a return to my running life but it 's no longer about me it 's up to something bigger than me now i pray my higher power will take good care of me in the weeks to come
