my car is sick , i have a little smart car which i bought new i noticed that a brake light had gone so i bought a bulb , before i had time to fix it the head light went i bought another bulb and fitted them on saturday while i was fixing those i noticed a side light had gone i just wiggled that one and it came back on but to change the front lights you have to take the front pannel of the car off , when i put it back together i did not tighten a small peice under the window so i lost that when i was cleaning the car on saturday i noticed the carpet in the foot wells was wet this happened last year and mercedes charged me about for new seals when it was only months out of warentee last night on the way home from work i drove into the back of someone on the motorway i was in a traffic jam for over an hour and my attention started to wonder does not seem to be any damage to my car and i have protected no claims so no huge deal i was only doing about miles an hour my car is only three and a half years old and it feels like an old banger o ! i took my car in this morning , i rang the garage this afternoon and they said they needed to keep it for a few days , i'm on public transport for now and i am working from home on friday as i am going to the orthadontist i will probably have to get a taxi there though ! god knows how much all this is going to cost me i asked today and they said they would ring me before they do any work i will have to pay for i am hoping they will do most of it on good will as they only fixed the seals last year ! i 'll keep my fingers crossed ! thursday my car is going to cost to fix that 's ! ! !
