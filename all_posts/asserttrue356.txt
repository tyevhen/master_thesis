i recently tweeted something that got several dozen immediate retweets when you get to the end of a first draft , it 's always a great feeling because you know you 're at least of the way there many of the retweets and amens were from screenwriters , journalists , and professional wordsmiths the tweet came about because i was reading william m akers 's your screenplay sucks a fine book , btw , and i found myself smirking when akers said , on p , when you get to the bottom of your first draft , congratulations , you 're about of the way done ! smirking because , as any writer knows , of the way done is off by a factor of ten with a screenplay , especially , you 're nowhere near of the way done after a first draft so yeah , i swiped akers 's line for my tweet , but i rewrote it akers wo n't mind , he 's a screenwriter , because frankly it needed work get to the bottom needed shortening to get to the end , and the word congratulations is n't exactly right it conveys sarcasm rather than conjuring the false sense of security you get when you 've finally written a draft of something i thought about replacing you 're about of the way done with you 're about of the way done , but the latter is weak the word about weakens it , plus is low impact fuzzy far better to say crisp , light , less filling when i thought i was done , i had when you get to the end of a first draft , it 's always a great feeling because you know you 're of the way there still not the best wording , because i wanted to maximize the irony of remember , the whole point is that you have a tremendous false sense of confidence after finishing a first draft to bring out the irony a bit more , i decided to say at least every writer knows that the real writing happens during revision as hemingway famously quipped , every first draft of something is shit turns out , it applies even to tweets
