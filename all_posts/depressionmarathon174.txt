so today is my birthday i was born in you do the math i'm not thrilled with getting older , especially this old ! having had depression for , sometimes tumultuous , years , i do n't feel like i 've lived as many years as the number suggests i feel like i 've missed a lot career , relationship , financial status none of it is necessarily where i 'd like it to be but it is what it is , right ? all i can do is focus on making the most of the day in front of me i certainly do n't want to miss anymore i did n't do anything special today i worked some of my co workers remembered it was a big day , some did n't that 's okay but can i just say i hate facebook ? i drove home feeling a little sorry for myself the combination of coming home to an empty house and facebook kind of had me down facebook ! of all things ! here 's the thing , only one facebook friend wished me a happy birthday all day now i'm not a big facebook user , but i seem to get notified everyday of some friend 's birthday most of the time i respond to the notification with a little birthday wish on that friend 's timeline so when only one friend posted a little blurb wishing me a happy birthday today , i was , well , i'm embarrassed to say , a little sad thankfully , before i got too deep into my pity pot , i got on facebook and tried to figure out what was going on i mean , i could n't be that unpopular , could i ? after much research and a few tutorials , as i said i'm not a regular facebook er , i figured out my birthday was not visible on my profile apparently , that meant nobody was actually notified of the big event i changed the setting , my birthday is now visible , and i 've already received a few happy birthday wishes from friends whew ! i do n't think my ego could have handled a facebook shutout ! now that that 's settled , i'm going to spend the evening playing and snuggling with my dog unconditional love , there is nothing better earlier , i took myself out for dinner , and i'm sure my mom will call soon i can always count on that and there 's my phone now it 's my brother all is good in etta 's world and tomorrow will be another day , the first of another year life moves on i 'll keep moving on with it carry on , my friends !
