in my earlier articles , i 've discussed different types of transference that clients develop in therapy , including psychotherapy and the positive transference and psychotherapy and the erotic transference falling in love with your therapist in this article , i'm focusing on another common form of transference , the parental transference the effects of parental transference at work and in therapy as i 've mentioned in my prior articles , developing transference is n't limited to therapy people form transferential feelings in other relationships , including with mentors , teachers , a supervisor , in a relationship with a spouse or romantic partner , and so on transference is usually unconscious at least , at first over time , the client and therapist usually become increasingly aware of the transference and can use the transferential feelings in therapy as part of the therapeutic work what is parental transference ? the parental transference often develops where the client experiences the therapist as either a maternal or paternal figure often , this has nothing to do with age a therapist can be younger than a client and still evoke a parental transference the parental transference can be either positive or negative or it can alternate between positive and negative at different times in the same therapy when a client 's parent is deceased , the parental transference can be especially powerful and often provides an opportunity for a client to work through unresolved feelings toward the parent when an adult client has unmet childhood needs , it 's not unusual for him or her to develop a parental transference towards the therapist the counterpart of transference is the therapist 's countertransference if the therapist is psychodynamically trained , s he is usually aware of the client 's transference and any countertransferential feelings s he might have towards a client just as a client can develop a parental transference , a therapist can also develop countertransferential feelings towards the client in that case , the therapist has parental feelings towards the client a fictionalized vignette let 's look at a fictionalized vignette to illustrate how the parental transference can play out in therapy and how it can be worked through john john came to therapy because he felt anxious around his new director at work although he was successful in his career , he had developed anxiety related symptoms when the new director replaced the former director , who had retired john had a very good relationship with his former director , joe joe was a mentor and helped john to move up in the company even though john maintained contact with joe , he missed their talks and his joe 's easygoing style john 's new director , nina , came from another company she had a reputation for being very talented and innovative in their field when john first met nina , he felt that their meeting went well enough , so he could n't understand why he felt uneasy with her there was nothing objective that john could pinpoint that could explain his anxiety around her even though nina praised his contribution to a big project and let him know that she was pleased with his work , john was anxious about falling short of her expectations no matter how he tried to convince himself that there was no objective reason why he should feel this way , his anxiety increased over time , which is why he came to therapy initially , john was able to form a good therapeutic alliance with his therapist but , after a few weeks , he began to worry about how she saw him he worried that he was n't being a good patient in therapy because he could n't figure out why he was anxious around his new director the effect of parental transference at work and in therapy john 's therapist assured him that they were just at the beginning of their exploration of his problem , they would explore this together , and she had no expectation that he would figure it out on his own objectively , john knew that therapy is a collaborative process and that clients are n't expected to determine the underlying cause of their problems but , on an emotional level , he felt he was falling short in therapy and that his therapist would soon feel disappointed in him , if she was n't already disappointed he could n't understand why he felt this way transferential feelings are unconscious and can be difficult to understand as john and his therapist explored his family background , it soon became apparent what was happening at work as well as in his therapy as an only child , john grew up feeling closer to his father than his mother whereas john and his father spent a lot of time together camping , going to sporting events and building models , john spent relatively little time with his mother she spent long hours at the office and on weekends she was involved in community events whenever john spent time around his mother , he was acutely aware of how impatient she was with him she tended to be aloof and critical of him john felt like he was a disappointment to his mother , so he felt anxious whenever he was around her after john 's father died , when he was eight , he missed his father a lot he spent many hours alone in his room dinner time with his mother was a lonely affair because she hardly talked and when she did , she would criticize john for falling short in some way as a result , john felt like a failure and that he never met up to her expectations as his therapist talked to john about parental transference , john began to understand his relationships with joe and nina and how he had unconsciously superimposed his parental relationships on them john realized joe was like his father joe was warm , generous and kind , just like john 's father he also spent time helping john to develop in his career , and he had nurturing qualities similar to john 's father so , it was easy to see how john would form a positive paternal transference towards joe but nina was nothing like his mother even though nina was different than his mother , she was still an authority figure , similar in nature to how a mother is an authority figure in a child 's life unconsciously , he kept waiting for her to morph into his mother as time went on , john 's anxiety increased because of his unconscious anticipation john and his therapist also discussed how his anxiety towards her was similar to his anxiety around his mother even though he and his therapist had a non hierarchical relationship and she was nothing like his mother , he still feared that his therapist would be disappointed in him , similar to how his mother was disappointed in him as they continued to explore these feelings , john realized that his problems in romantic relationships often involved his fear that his partner would become disappointed with him he realized how this hindered him in terms of starting and maintaining relationships as john and his therapist continued to work together , john became aware that he had unresolved trauma related to the loss of his father and his unmet childhood emotional needs with his mother see my article what is child emotional neglect ? he and his therapist did inner child work to mourn what he did n't get as a child , especially after his father died , and to nurturing that younger part of him that felt unloved see my article nurturing your inner child further exploration about his parental transference towards his director and his therapist helped john to differentiate his feelings for his mother and his feelings for his director and therapist it also helped john to distinguish who his mother was when he was growing up and who she was now he realized that his mother had softened over the years and that she had become a warmer , kinder person with age the more john was able to make the differentiation between his mother from his childhood from his mother now , the better he felt working through transference and feeling confident rather than doubting himself , john began to feel confident at work and at ease with his director he felt comfortable with his therapist conclusion transferential feelings are a normal part of life , whether they occur in therapy , at work or in other important relationships transference is usually unconscious so , initially , people believe that whatever they 're feeling about a person is directly related to the person and not affected by earlier feelings psychotherapy offers an opportunity to work through transferential feelings as well as resolve unmet childhood needs and unresolved loss and trauma getting help in therapy transferential issues are difficult to work through on your own transferential feelings are often entrenched , enduring and can last a lifetime if you do n't seek help not all therapists work with transference , so if you think that your problems are related to transference whether this involves transference in a relationship or at
