there s an image i see going around facebook a lot lately titled summer rules , it sets a long list of requirements that must be met before children are allowed to use electronics while i ve certainly seen some dissenting voices , the overwhelming response seems to be one of great satisfaction that s the way to make kids live life right , people explain , congratulating each other on assuring that children make exactly the choices that the adults in their lives think are most appropriate , even during what , for many , is their one real break from school all year long source as you ve probably already guessed , i find this graphic frustrating at best , infuriating at worst why ? here are just a few reasons i already fail to meet this list of requirements every single day my bed gets made at night , right before i get into it , because that s my routine and there s nothing wrong with it i spend plenty of days in my pj s my hair rarely gets combed out the breakage ! the frizz ! , as a light finger combing that doesn t unnecessarily disturb my curls is usually all that s needed i tend to brush my teeth while i open up my computer for the day , checking email and facebook notifications while tending to oral hygiene ditto for breakfast i get to make all these decisions for myself , because i m an adult , but i also got to make these decisions for myself when i was younger , because my parents respected me as i hope i ve just made clear , doing all of these first section rules before electronics every morning , or even doing all of them every day , is pretty arbitrary yes , i get that we want children to be clean and to eat well and all that , but there are a whole bunch of better ways to encourage healthy habits besides holding electronics over children s heads as bribes blackmail making some things good activities , and others bad the old books versus screens dichotomy is a great way to teach kids just that but not necessarily in the direction you want what is forbidden usually becomes more desirable screens ! what is forced generally becomes less desirable books ! art ! playing outside ! tidying ! helping others ! is that really what anyone wants ? when activities are instead presented as equally valid choices , when children are involved in family life , and when adults themselves are engaging in a range of different types of activities , children are going to be influenced by that and sometimes ? sometimes they really love something and will want to spend all their time engaged in that something , and if we want to nurture passion , sometimes we re going to have to accept that other people children included will be passionate about something we neither like or understand , and learn to be okay with that no one gets to choose what someone else will love , whether they re children or adults also ? lumping things like artistic creation and reading into the same category as cleaning is a good way to extra , super duper discourage them like , has anyone really thought that one through ? there are a whole lot of different uses for electronics i m going to assume here that the creator of the list of rules means computers and video games here , and not , say , a microwave , because they re not very clear if we re talking about video games , see above on passion if we re talking about computers well some of the things people regularly do on the computer include writing emails , reading fiction and articles and essays and poetry , writing blog posts or essays or fiction , watching youtube videos for both instruction and entertainment , playing games strategy games and simulation games and puzzle games , talking to friends , creating art , participating in online discussions and forums , researching any topic you can imagine , looking for new hobbies or activities , looking at art whenever people decide to generalize screens or electronics i can t help but be exasperated you d think that when we opened up our computers , there was just one option stare at blue screen like zombie in reality , the amount of activities it s possible to engage in on screened electronics is huge it s a really big window into a whole lot of the world , and dismissing it as bad , or deciding as the above image seems to be doing that virtually any activity off of screens is better than any on seems completely absurd luckily , someone out there named laura sweet did a bit of fixing have you woken up today ? then you can enjoy summer like kids should now that s something i can get behind
