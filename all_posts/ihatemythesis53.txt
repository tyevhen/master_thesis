dear miserable grad student , i hate my thesis adviser i really want to kill her with a bowie knife i know that i should just wait till after i graduate , but that feels forever away and my anger is distracting me from my studies so maybe if i kill her now , i 'll be able to work more efficiently but then again , the department may look upon it unfavorably and is a bowie knife the right tool ? should i use a bigger knife ? or nun chucks , maybe ? ps i love your blog ! thanks for brightening my day sincerely , blood thirsty in baton rouge dear blood thirsty , thank you for you warm praise from your letter , i can see that you are a very creative person so i am quite flattered now , i know that academia can be as all consuming as a black hole but let me remind you that on the outside , murder is illegal it is also mean the i hate my thesis blog and all subsidiaries does not condone violence in any way that said , you need to find a healthy way to vent i would advise starting a blog like mine , but i do n't want any competition instead i advise making a voodoo doll in the likeness of your thesis adviser you can sew little costumes to make it look exactly like her down to the smallest cross stitch and then you can rip that dolly to shreds with your bowie knife or , you could grow up , stop procrastinating , get back to work , and finish your degree you must remember that thesis advisers are people too and if you 're lucky , you may become one some day yours wants you to graduate just as much as you do so give her a break , bring her some donuts , and go onward to the finish
