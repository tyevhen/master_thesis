yesterday , my mother and i went for a walk i took my camera it was a truly lovely day ! we saw new shoots emerging leaves unfurling plants growing everywhere the sun shining on old rosehips and new buds the sun made everything bright and hazy to my camera lense we wondered what was wrong with these berries , that the birds never ate them in the fall ! it was a windy day , and the water was curling into small waves as it hit the shore i love the pattern of branches on sky new buds on windblown branches the moon in a bright blue sky this bird , a mourning dove , sits on the wire outside our house almost every day , singing her sweet , melancholy song when i do n't spend time outside every day , i feel like i'm not living life properly yet at the same time , taking walks often saddens me so much development , pavement , cars , and lonely patches of bedraggled woods things are n't the way they 're supposed to be but a sunny day is still beautiful peace , idzie
