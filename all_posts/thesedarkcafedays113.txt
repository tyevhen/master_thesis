since i 've been out of school , my mom has been accepting of my no longer attending church , but i know she still wants me to remain a christian suddenly , i am seeing everything in christian culture from the outside , and it makes one realize just how alienating it must be to listen to if one is n't inclined to give their life to god when i attended church my first weeks home from school , i felt so empty and isolated listening to the admonitions of the pastor to have joy in christ the music was all one loud call to have hope , to look happy how was i supposed to do any of these things when i felt abandoned by god , broken and battered ? my hopes and dreams shattered and the whole time i was beaten up , i had been trying so desperately to serve god i had put faith in him time and again after being disappointed i had begged for help , for mercy instead , i was only more broken when i shared my hurt with others , they only gave me empty assurances that it would get better , that god had a plan , that when god closes one door he opens another , that they would pray for me , that god was in control and i just needed to have faith in him well , i kept trying new doors and every damn door was shut in my face god has just shut all the doors so i'm backed into a grimy corner with nowhere to go i just lie here stuck on the floor i never gave up hope before , but now there 's no escaping this stuck ness it 's even worse in some ways than when i was in terrible darkness people say they accept whatever you want to pursue or who you want to be , but , in reality , we all have an opinion demi lovato once said that when she was unraveling suffering from mental illness and substance abuse while doing her music full time , people kept putting band aids on her and propping her back up i feel a bit like that instead of getting to the real heart of my problems , people just want you to look happy again , so they apply temporary fixes and people do n't want me to pursue risky ventures music , entrepreneurship , etc or turn my back on the religion i grew up with so they constantly nudge you away from that but what if those things helped me find a new , better path for my life ? and thats why people try to pacify you with empty platitudes they dont want to hear the nitty gritty of your suffering because it makes them uncomfortable to see you suffering but band aids do n't fix bullet holes , as taylor swift kindly reminds us every hour on pop radio i guess this is a time of stepping back from everything i took for granted in life and reexamining it 's place but i do n't have answers for what i need or believe and it 's overwhelming to have everything you built your life and identity on put in front of the firing squad but i ca n't help it its like my soul is rejecting it like a transplanted organ i had put in years ago i never thought this would happen to me i do n't know where to go i do n't have the answers
