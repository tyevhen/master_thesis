i do n't need to write about my depression today , thank god , since it has been in abeyance for three days my mood transitions , once the right medications are put in the gumball machine of my brain , are spectacularly sudden as elisa posted yesterday , welcome to oz in technicolor and it 's just like that i step out of a black and white movie into technicolor i'm suddenly on the other side of the interrogation room 's one way mirror , no longer in the room with its gray formica desk and steel chairs barely softened by aging vinyl it 's like jumping off a cliff with the intent of suicide and suddenly discovering you 've sprouted wings like dedalus and can fly , or a fish out of water who suddenly discovers he can breathe air and tolerate the sun , a bear who steps into spring , forgetting his long , dark hibernation with the taste of his first salmonberry you get the picture i should mention the little bobble headed statuette of st zyprexa i 've glued to my dashboard give credit where credit is due incidentally , and i just realized this , tonic the poem i posted yesterday was actually the next in the rising to mania sequence of my ms sine wave that i had been posting daily before my relapse so , hoping my mood will continue euthymic , i 'll post the next one in the sequence today , a poem i was not going to include in the ms except that my editor , kathleen , put it back in running away i tried so hard today not to be depressed i bought my wife a mink , told my boss he was a genius gave my shoes to the poor , then took a bus with no destination to wherever it didn t go it dropped me in the suburbs where hedges clawed and lawnmowers growled at my chinos i took refuge in a garage next to an old lincoln who smelled of rubber and oil if you park at disneyland , he said , you can meet a lot of cars i told him i wasn t a car too bad , he said when the garage door opener hummed and sun puddled under the door i pressed my bus transfer to the lincoln 's windshield but the driver ignored me barely i bellied beneath the descending door and ran back to the bus stop the driver looked at me tenderly , like a mother i m sorry , he said , but i recognize you no harm done , i said did anyone else ? everyone , he said , and tore up my transfer unpublished thine in gratefulness , craig erick
