i am often asked questions about spinal bulbar muscular atrophy better known as kennedy 's disease i would easily say that of the questions asked could be summarized in the following q a q who gets kennedy 's disease ? a kennedy 's disease is a genetic disease , passed on from generation to generation in a family it is an x linked recessive inherited gene generally , males who inherit the gene exhibit symptoms , while females who inherit the gene are usually just carriers females , in some instances , may also exhibit symptoms especially in their later years q how is spinal bulbar muscular atrophy kennedy 's disease diagnosed ? a up until the mid s , kennedy 's disease was often misdiagnosed fortunately , there is a blood test today that checks a person 's dna for the defective chromosome any doctor or nurse can draw the blood and send it off to a dna laboratory for testing test results are normally returned within three to six weeks the test determines the number of cag repeats within the androgen receptor ar gene if you have less than repeats , that is considered normal if you have repeats , you are considered borderline and you could experience some minor symptoms repeats that are or greater reflect that you have the full gene mutation abnormal expansion of the cag tandem repeat since females have two x chromosomes , they can have either one , and in rare cases both , chromosomes defective q can the disease be passed on to my children ? a if the mother is the only carrier of the defective gene in the x chromosome , there is a chance of passing the affected gene on to male children in which case , they would develop symptoms in adulthood the chance of passing the defective gene on to female children is also in which case , they would be carriers of the gene , but probably never develop the actual symptoms if the father is the only carrier of the defective gene , the chances of passing the defective gene to a male child are however , it is certain that the gene will be passed on to a female child , and she will be a carrier of the gene this genetic chart shows the possible ways the gene can be passed q one of my parents has the defective gene i have or am considering having children should i be tested or should i have my children tested ? a some families have even considered prenatal testing if you have this concern , you should consult with a genetic counselor these professionals are best equipped to help answer these type questions q why do n't we hear much about kennedy 's disease ? a kennedy 's disease is considered a rare medical disorder it is estimated that only in , individuals worldwide have kennedy 's disease however , since many go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed for years , it is difficult to quantify how many have this gene defect normally , when a person is diagnosed with the defective gene , they usually comment that they have a brother , uncle , or grandfather that had similar symptoms
