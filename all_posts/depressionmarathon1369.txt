late november , , i noticed i was n't feeling quite right nothing new or special , traumatic or dramatic going on in my life i was years old , married , years into my new career , had cars in the garage and dogs in the house living in our first home , both working full time , we were fine financially , spiritually , physically i had depression as a teenager , and i recognized this new feeling as a familiar , old feeling i sought help , therapy and psychiatric intervention , but by march , , i was in the hospital unable to function at work or home , and unable to feel the joy that i cognitively recognized around me , i was hopeless i could n't cry i could n't laugh i could n't sleep i could n't cope i started some new meds and improved i went back to work i went back to the hospital , again , a few months later i chose ect treatments that summer , desperate to get back to me rebounding in the fall of , my spouse announced , i'm leaving i guess i was n't the same person anymore , but i will never really know nothing more was said of the reasoning , just , i'm leaving three months of painful , confusing , distant cohabitation later , the empty house was mine alone well , mine with my boy , puck black lab , still my faithful companion today it was december in less than one year , this illness had totally turned my life inside out and upside down dreams of owning a small farm together , growing old together , sharing more and more joy together they all died as i stepped into my empty living room that day , december , it was a sentinel moment caused by depression over the next several months , i returned to work , and then to the hospital , and then work , and then the hospital in the spring of , i made a decision to enter an week inpatient program where i could receive the care i could n't seem to provide for myself things like cooking , showering , and socializing had become overwhelming and foreign i also entered this program to learn some new skills i needed new coping skills to deal with myself , this illness , and others and i got them ! it was my first exposure to dbt sidenote i was formerly a mental health practitioner first career i knew all about dbt and the corresponding stigmatizing diagnosis it was created to treat , borderline personality disorder during my mental health career , i used that same garbage can diagnosis on patients who just would n't get better , or who spoke up a little too much , or who disagreed with their treatment plan too often now here i was , carrying this same diagnosis and pissed as hell about it ! but it got me into this program , and i knew if i went back home alone , at that time , my depression would have killed me in retrospect , i did have bpd traits , and learning dbt has improved the quality of my life immensely the skills i learned are now an ingrained piece of my personality i am so grateful to have had the opportunity to learn them unfortunately , even with these shiny new skills , the black cloud of depression continued to blind my path it was while learning these new skills , in my fourth week of hospitalization , that i was fired my job ? i was a physical therapist in a hospital i was terminated via letter , which arrived one week after my official last day of employment ! it was the cruelest of all events , and it never would have happened if i had been in the hospital for breast cancer , or heart disease , or maybe even alcoholism ! i immediately phoned my psychiatrist a member of the hospital , my employer 's , board of governers , and i learned that she knew nothing of this action i spoke with my medical director who was also shocked and had not been consulted in an apparent unilateral action , a member of the hospital 's hr department had decided i was done long story short , i made multiple attempts to get my job back other professionals made attempts on my behalf i complied with everything the hr rep requested i do in order to return to work , but it soon became clear that no matter how many hoops i lept through , she would find another one to place in front of me it was grueling , exhausting , and demoralizing i sued i won but i miss my department , my patients , my job while this scenario was playing itself out , the hospital apparently had another employee , with breast cancer , who was in the middle of a year medical leave based on my experience , i firmly believe if i had any illness , other than mental illness , i would still be working at this hospital today to be continued
