let me begin with a quick thank you for all the wonderful feedback i received this week it would seem that my 'creative beginnings' book tour brought up a host of childhood memories for a number of readers i shall have to start a petition for an adult only 'dress as your favourite book character' day why should the kids have all the fun ? after eating all my mother 's day chocolates i can definitely pass as moonface from the folk of the faraway tree ! one of the workshops i run at body soul holistics is a vision board course this two hour workshop helps my clients to create a vision of what they want in their lives from career , love , family or health matters when i was thinking about characters and scene setting for my creative writing class it dawned on me that vision boards could help in creating stories too i went through a pile of magazines and cut out any photographs and pictures i felt a connection with , in other words , pictures that made me smile if you have been following my blog and feel motivated then please give this exercise a go , it really is addictive and you could end up with a long list of story , poem or article ideas no more writer 's block ! if you do n't want to write a bestseller then use the instructions below to create a vision of what you want in your life , collect pictures of sports cars , happy people , piles of money , people exercising , pictures that represent the job you want or ideal man i have a whole board dedicated to johnny depp ! all you need to get started is a cork board or other suitable base a scrapbook works just as well large assortment of magazines choose magazines that you would n't normally pick up glue and scissors that 's it you are ready to go , so how do you begin ? flick through the magazines and tear out all the photographs , wording , pictures and sayings you see which draw your eye or make you smile do n't question why you like these things just cut them out and start to make a pile once you have a good selection spread them out in front of you and begin to lay your favourites on the board some of your original choices may not feel right anymore , just put these to one side for now as you lay your pictures out you may start to feel the story coming together , it 's helpful to have a notepad handy so you can make notes when your board is covered take a good look at what you have created , is there a bestselling novel planned out before you ? if you ca n't feel it yet then put it away for a couple of days this is the board i made this week yes i am a fantasy , myth and legend fan ! pictures collected from spirit destiny , prediction and soul and spirit magazines you can use any magazine for your own creations easy is n't it you can create vision boards for anything the life you desire , job you dream about , health , creative stories or you can make one as a gift for a wedding or special birthday being creative is so much fun and vision boards are a wonderful past time , kids love to make them too , its how i came up with my resolutions on new year 's eve
