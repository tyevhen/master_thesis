there 's a famous quote by mark twain when i was a boy of , my father was so ignorant i could hardly stand to have the old man around but when i got to be , i was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years that pretty much sums up my attitudes regarding mozilla the dev platform not mozilla the browser infrastructure mozilla the runtime framework i 've been programming for about years , and when i first encountered mozilla the dev framework years ago via the book , creating applications with mozilla i was horribly unimpressed i thought , who 'd want to put up with programming that way ? it all seemed so overfactored , so byzantine xul , xbl wth ? ? but a funny thing happened like a lot of people who learned to program in the s , i went through a learning curve on things like separating presentation from application logic , the usefulness of metadata , the importance of security sandboxing , and an ability to program in multiple languages including scripting languages in a machine and os independent manner and the advantages of a packaged app artifacts and logic in separate pieces rolled up inside a deployable bundle , to say nothing of a plug in architecture with well defined mechanisms for installing and uninstalling executables when eclipse first appeared , eclipse sounded to me , at the time like everything mozilla the application dev platform should have been i totally drank the eclipse kool aid and i was totally wrong eclipse was and is a terrible platform for creating non ide thick client apps heavy , slow , awkwardly designed apis , high learning curve , tied to a language , tied to a particular presentation technology , no html rendering engine , etc etc no amount of lip gloss will cover its flaws i have n't quite come full circle yet on mozilla i'm there , but after taking another look at it i stumbled upon this slide show by brian king , which got me interested again , i am starting to think mozilla is the most attractive option for thick client development by far it wo n't serve every need and should n't be worn as a straightjacket if more suitable attire is available , but for the use case i think it deserves more respect than it gets long story short if i were doing ria development and needed a way to create relatively secure web savvy desktop apps without having to learn a bunch of new legacy technologies with names like air , javafx , or silverlight , the mozilla framework is where i 'd start it 's mature , it 's built on standard web technologies , and it 's ready to go oh , and it also has no hype machine propping it up maybe that 's what 's holding it back ?
