last week a study was published that childhood bullying and violence have the dna decay associated with elder adults it was found that a specific chromosone , telomeres , is affected in children with violence related stress telomeres , which prevent dna from unraveling , get shorter each time cells divide , which limits the number of times cells can divide early breakdown indicates poor survival and chronic disease the study was conducted out of duke university and was a longitudinal study as reported by us news and world report , the duke team found that children with a history of two or more kinds of violent exposures such as domestic violence , frequent bullying or physical abuse by an adult had significantly more telomere loss than other children idan shalev , a postdoctoral researcher in psychology and neuroscience at duke university 's institute for genome sciences policy , said this is the first time it has been shown that our telomeres can shorten at a faster rate even at a really young age , while kids are still experiencing stress the majority of studies that are conducted in world of psychology are treatment and assessment based meaning , after psychological event happens this is how to treat or when we assess a person we should look for this or that , but what about preventative measures ? granted , we cannot predict that a child or even an adult will be exposed to any amount of bullying or violence , but if we are able to educate the masses better , maybe we can avoid the decay of that chromosome and allow kids to be kids and develop emotionally at the right times make your monday not mundane ! yes
