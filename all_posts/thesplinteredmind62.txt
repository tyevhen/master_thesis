update this article was featured in my book saying no to suicide , with added commentary morning blues friday entry i believe it is high time for me to acknowledge that my depression is out of control i have been trying the past few weeks since the lay off to keep it at bay , but i'm not making any progress i'm simply sad all of the time i am too depressed to write my book or draw i'm too depressed to clean i only stir to life when the girls arrive then responsibilities force me to move and function and i still do n't write or draw this is not living i woke up this morning contemplating suicide in the same moment i thought about death , i realized that the depression had taken too deeply a hold one thing that happened in september that could be accounting for my recent descent into darkness was the sudden change in the amount of daylight i felt the change rather keenly this year i usually expect winter depression to hit me by the end of october so this is a little earlier than usual perhaps i was vulnerable because i was recently laid off and already down perhaps there was no trigger at all what i do know is that there is a solution to remedy this problem daylight spectrum light bulbs i will buy some today i also have a little girl very excited about a fun run in an hour she is with her mum this week , but i had made sure to mark the event on my calendar i hope to publish my article on adhd daydreaming later today , so i'm telling myself not to worry about it now i need to exercise , get some sunlight , and hurry off to watch my girl i had intended to write when i woke about how my morning routine might be contributing to my lack of productivity , but suicidal ideation trumped that , and now daddy duty calls , and that trumps everything d you might also like depression ways i fought to stay afloat writing with focus when depression clouds the view thinking deeply again i will survive i always do linkwithin
