when you follow your bliss doors will open where you would not have thought there would be doors and where there would n't be a door for anyone else joseph campbell the side door , oil on canvas , x , is the largest painting i have ever completed it was intimidating to cover such a large space , and yet to many artists this size of painting is probably an every day task to me , it seemed an ocean of white , my brushes appeared far too small to cover such an area i am sure it was similar to the fear that some writers feel when they stare at the expectant blank page on their computer , typewriter or notepad personally , small paintings are comfortable i addressed this in my note about self portrait , renewed i feel more freedom within the confines of a little painting large paintings seem to carry more of an expectation , as though they must shout their message it was a great learning experience tackling this painting which was the last piece i completed for my passages show in at abbozzo gallery the side door appears in the background of the painting work in progress , that i just blogged about recently i wanted the two paintings to tie together visually and also enjoyed the idea of seeing the side door being worked on within another painting i painted the two pieces in conjunction with one another but naturally the side door took much longer to complete the subject once again is my friend gayle and her beautiful house north of burlington this house is so special , so old , with such a history it seems to live and breathe in concert with gayle and her family this house wants to be painted i have captured gayle and her house in more than half a dozen paintings the entire experience of visiting gayle at home is special every time as andrew wyeth painted the kuerners innumerable times over three decades , so i intend to paint gayle at her stone house for as long as i am able no matter what far reach of the continent i travel to , this special piece of land and the people who live there continue to draw me back the porch you see on the side of the house is no longer there gayle 's husband has since replaced it with a beautiful new porch he is a woodworker i am pleased to have captured the old porch before it came down , a little piece of its history kept intact my aim with this piece was to ask the viewer to wonder where she was going and where she had been i sought movement from the melting snow in a pattern of thaw that would circle around and lead the eye to gayle opening the door where does that door lead ? can the viewer tell that the pane of glass in the lower section of the door has broken ? i remember gayle remarking about the broken glass and worrying that it might spoil the painting to have to paint a boarded window on the contrary , it is precisely for that very reason that i wanted to paint it it is the imperfections that are often truly beautiful it indicates movement and life , that things are happening there , that it is lived in i also used gayle 's poppy red hat once again as a nice splash of colour to bring the viewer 's eye to her and focus there for awhile also the aluminum container by the door was fun to paint i love to paint things just as they are and not shift things around too much i would rather move than expect things to move for me it is much the same as when models ask what they should wear whatever you enjoy and feels comfortable i usually reply , though i do suggest that perhaps complex patterns might be avoided i 'd rather not go crazy rendering paisley or plaid there are always little parts of a painting that are particularly enjoyable to paint in this case it is gayle 's reflection in the glass when i look upon it i still remember the very painting session that i painted that part , almost like when you are taken back to distance times when you smell something familiar it is as though there is a creative fingerprint on that section it has its own memory exciting news ! my next solo exhibition is pretty much finalized if you can make it i would love it if you stopped by to see my new work inspired from a recent adventure in newfoundland , canada this exhibition will examine the people and places i encountered in the truly magical land of newfoundland i hope to see you there ! heather horton newfoundland portraits november th , abbozzo gallery oakville , ontario , canada opening reception friday november th , pm i am posting sneak peeks of works as i paint them that you can see via my regular website have a beautiful day , heather the doors we open and close each day decide the lives we live flora whittemore
