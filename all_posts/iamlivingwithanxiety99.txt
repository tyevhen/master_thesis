when i was anxious this week , i thought to myself , i'm ok i'm a good person i do a good job this has n't been easy to do , but it has helped me to push through the things i need to get done also , about a week ago some ocd behaviors started to creep back , such as with washing the dishes or checking the thermostat i hate to do the latter ! they have n't gotten too bad yet , and i'm determined to not let these behaviors return all in all , it was n't a bad week i think i'm not buying into my catastrophic thinking as much , so that is certainly progress !
