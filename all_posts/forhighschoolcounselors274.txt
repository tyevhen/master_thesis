several weeks ago two students tracked me down in the lunchroom and asked to speak to me about a situation that happened over the weekend truly , weekend parties , twitter , facebook , instagram , and other types of social media can be a real pain when they are the cause for a lot of drama at school so , i postponed my plans and sat and listened to their problem one girl explained that she was at a kickback over the weekend and was accused of sleeping with her friend 's brother since this rumor was now all over school , the brother 's girlfriend wanted to beat her up i looked at the other girl and asked her if this was true and she nodded i told both girls that i needed for them to stay in the lunchroom while i go to speak to the assistant principal about a potential fight after a couple of minutes , i found the assistant principal and told her about the situation she told me that she was aware of the rumor and she had spoken to the girlfriend who was very upset about her boyfriend going to this kickback fortunately , she had planned to speak to all three of them before the situation got out of hand next , our conversation shifted to this phenomena of the kickback apparently , as innocent as the name sounds , it is truly not somewhere you want your th grader going to hang out with their friends the urban dictionary defines a kickback as always hosted at an individual 's house , a kickback consists of friends getting together to engage in party activities such as drinking etc , without the hassle and drawbacks of a big party although an invite verbal or otherwise is not necessary it is understood that a kickback is friends only and is not to exceed or persons a good option for those not wishing to get their house trashed not to be confused with a party or rager www urbandictionary com in fact , i downloaded the so called rules for a kickback without the expletives and i put some of them in my own words you can see the original at the web address below source unidentified kickbackrule no ruining another guys chance to get some booty these acts are punishable up to death kickbackrule put money on the liquor , no matter if you are a woman , viking , avatar , or space creature kickbackrule if you know you are not able to pay , we take sex payments as well women only kickbackrule know your limit we ai n't taking care of nobody every man , woman , or minor how did u get here ?
