here is something i could have written actually i did , only not here in a study published online in genome research , researchers have for the first time shown that the environment experienced in the womb defines the newborn epigenetic profile http www sciencedaily com releases htm it goes on to say that there are chemical modifications to our dna that has implications for later life what they mean is that traumatic experience during womb life can modify dna expression so as to change who we are and what we suffer from years later i have written about this process , called methylation , in my life before birth so when we look to answers for cancer , diabetes and heart disease we had better check out womb life i already said it but it sounds more authoritative when it comes from professional researchers and professors in this study they looked at twins and their dna methylation they looked at umbilicord tissue , cord blood and the placentas of newborn twins they found that even in identical twins there are great differences in these profiles and here is their important conclusion this must be due to events that happened in the womb to one twin and not the other so although twins share a womb , what happens to each of them can be quite different that is why when they do twin studies and omit womb life , they are missing key elements of the puzzle because they differ even in the womb their later genetic profile may be quite different therefore what diseases they get and how long they live can also be different and , no surprise , the authors believe that womb life events may have a more profound effect than previously thought they claim that this discovery is a powerful tool for managing future health and modifying risk so as my mother used to say , columbus discovered america their research is critical , however , to the ongoing frame of reference for understanding why we get sick the lead author believes we can modify risk through dietary intervention and other environmental approaches he does not say what is crucial how about we intervene during womb life and make it salubrious and salutary ? how about we make womb life a great place to be ? we can do it through education and we can also do it by reliving those adverse womb events and changing them to non deleterious events i think we can reverse methylation , and i have written about it in my latest book at least we can remove some of its embedded trauma that , in my opinion , is what reliving key traumas do , and is why we can prevent future diseases or at least modify their harm we can unlock the trauma from its hiding place and liberate its energy so it does not more harm remember the oath all doctors take ? first do no harm
