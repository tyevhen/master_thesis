breakup when closure with your ex is n't possible in a situation that is volatile or when one or both people feel unable or unwilling to communicate with each other , closure might not be possible for the couple but most of the time , people feel a need for closure and it becomes frustrating when this is n't possible it can also prolong the grieving process after the breakup let 's take a look at a fictionalized scenario which is representative of one of these situations ina and ted ina and ted were in a relationship for five years they lived together for the last three years although they loved each other very much , one of their ongoing problems was that ted did n't like to talk about his feelings and he became impatient when ina wanted to talk about her feelings or about the relationship

that ted came from a family where the only emotion that was expressed was anger ted 's father was especially volatile when he got angry and , although he never hit ted , ted was frightened by his father 's angry outbursts he also grew up being frightened by his own anger or any strong emotions that he experienced whenever he experienced a strong emotion , his first impulse was to push it down it took ted a while to tell ina that he loved her , and throughout their relationship , it still made him feel uncomfortable since ted would n't allow any strong emotions , after five years , the relationship felt flat to ina when she tried to talk to ted about this , he walked into another room coping with a breakup when closure with your ex is n't possible a few days later , ina came home and she was shocked to discover that all of ted 's possessions were gone at first , she thought they had been robbed but when she saw that many valuable items were still in the apartment and all of her things were still there , she realized that he had moved out without a word there was no message not even a note ina tried to call ted on his cellphone and at his work number , but he did n't pick up and he did n't respond to her messages although she knew that ted did n't like to deal with strong emotions , she could n't believe that he would end the relationship this way she still loved him , and she hoped that they would be able to work things out after a few days , he sent her a text in which he told her that she needed to move on with her life because things were n't working out between

occurred and that ted refused to speak with her she knew he was n't communicative about his feelings , but she never would have guessed that he would do something like this ina found herself

talking to ted about her feelings and to say out loud what she was feeling at first , ina felt awkward doing this , but as she opened up , she felt how freeing it was to express her feelings to ted even though he was n't really there she told him how hurt she was and how disappointed she felt that he ended their relationship this way and refused to speak with her as she expressed her feelings , she had a realization that , all along , she had been asking ted to do something that he was incapable of doing to listen to her express her feelings and for him to express how he felt on some level , she always knew this , but when she spoke out loud , as if ted was in the room with her , she had a deep awareness of it in time , this helped ina to inwardly forgive ted , even though they never spoke again realizing that he was incapable of doing what she wanted and needed allowed her to let go of her anger coping with a breakup when closure with your ex is n't possible over the next several
