the most recent jama has a literature review on how well physicians self assessments compare with external ratings outcomes of various sorts the sad but apparently true answer not very well of course , if you ve been reading psychological research by the likes of dunning and colleagues , this will surprise you very little summary a minority of studies found a positive relationship between self assessment and external ratings , but most found no relationship or a negative relationship an analysis based on a small subset of studies found that the physicians who rated themselves highest on self assessments actually showed the poorest performance on varied external criteria in other words , the accuracy of self assessment is generally poor , but even more so among people who are the most confident check out the abstract here taken together , these conclusions prompt reflection on the use of self rated assessment and its role in lifelong learning and value in regulation and patient care p my advice watch out for cockiness amongst yourselves and your peers and seek to find ways of validating your self assessments
