when i was five , i went to kindergarten and while i was still five , i left kindergarten as a kindergarten dropout , my family started me out with some curriculum , but everything was always pretty flexible , and over the years we organically moved into something that looked more and more like unschooling we lived and learned together as a family , reading out loud and by ourselves , endlessly discussing books and tv shows , writing , joining a variety of different groups and clubs and classes , and just generally building our lives around what was interesting and important to us both individually and as a family the result is that now , in my early s , i look on the type of education i experienced with great fondness , and am continuing to learn in much the same way now as an adult i m grateful for having lived an unschooling lifestyle , and these are some of the reasons why one i got to spend as much or as little time as i wanted to on different subjects with a more traditional curriculum , either in school or out , how much time and effort is spent and expended on each subject is mandated and overseen by a teacher whereas i had the luxury of digging deep when i wanted to , immersing myself in something that fascinated me for as long as it held my attention , or simply doing a quick google search and stopping after i d finished a wikipedia article or two and maybe at least glanced at some of the sources the subjects i spent weeks or months reading about and researching and surrounding myself with were as diverse as world war ii and the civil rights movement , horses and photography , irish folklore and cooking and poetry with many other things , way too many to count , the interest lasted a much shorter time but all of these things were meaningful , and fed a need i had at the time , whether it was a spark of interest at a passing comment made by a friend , or a burning desire to learn as much as i possibly could about a subject i was making a big part of my life the lack of pressure to spend enough time to make learning about a specific thing worthwhile freed me to learn about a wide range of things without feeling guilt if i only wanted to learn a little bit about something , or pressure to stop reading about horses already and move on to something else two i knew that all subjects were interconnected for the most part , things weren t broken up into individual subjects something that probably would have looked like english to someone on the outside bled over into and encompassed history , public speaking , writing , art i didn t learn by subject , i just learned , and a whole bunch of subjects were naturally involved in my learning this is something i ve carried over into adult life , where i tend to recognize the interconnectedness of different subjects and areas of my life i was never taught to compartmentalize things , so i value how much all different types of learning are involved in all different aspects of life we also valued lots of real life skills like , for instance , dog wrangling pet care three i had the freedom to quit for the most part schools , and all the classes you must take in schools , are not something you can choose to just stop going to or at least , you can t without some major repercussions , or parents willing to say they re homeschooling you this is regardless of whether a specific class or teacher is actually doing a good job at all of teaching their subject matter , and whether the information is relevant to the learner or hopelessly outdated and seemingly completely removed from real life application as a life learner , i was free to only keep things in my life that were actually adding value classes i thought were important , subjects that had relevance in my life and future plans if something wasn t working , or was causing a lot more stress than learning , or felt like an unsafe environment , or no longer held any interest for me , i was free to quit while sticking with things can also be important , i think it s really over emphasized in our culture people are shamed for quitting even for the most important reasons , and are encouraged to stay with things that are actively causing harm , and not adding any value to their lives thus i think that , along with persevering at difficult things , learning how to quit is also something everyone should be encouraged to learn how to do four i learned on my own timeline everyone knows that there are certain ages children are supposed to learn certain things , milestones that are supposed to be achieved at certain points in life this can cause a lot of shame for children deemed behind or slow learners , when really everyone just has their own timeline for learning i learned to read when i was or if i d been in school or with more school at home inclined parents this would have been considered a major issue as it was , i just learned when i was ready to , and quickly went on to devour a huge amount of books over the next several years , and eventually go on to become a published writer trying to hold children to an externally imposed timeline of what things should be learned when can cause a whole bunch of stress , shame , and unnecessary worry , for both kids and parents recognizing instead that each child is different , and will learn different things at different times when they re ready to can free children to learn at their own pace and in their own way , stress and guilt free sometimes i still feel bad or worried if i m not learning things as fast as others , or don t know some things that some others my age do but for the most part , i ve really internalized the message that learning is unique to the individual , and shouldn t be compared to that of others five i learned in authentic ways so often things in school are taught in a way that s really disconnected from a student s day to day life , things that have very little relevance to them , or are presented in ways that simply obscure any relevance any work produced by a student is generally only ever produced to get a grade , and will only be seen by a teacher and perhaps some classmates my experience , on the other hand , was very different the learning i did and the work i created felt genuinely meaningful , relevant to my life and goals , and truly authentic it was learning and work i felt good about as an example , i started writing book reviews for a homeschooling magazine in my teens , and moved on to blogging in my later teenage years through blogging , my writing improved so much i was creating content for an actual audience , about a subject i was passionate about , getting meaningful feedback , seeing my gradual improvement , having exciting goals to work towards , and getting other writing opportunities presented to me because of my work i still feel that way about blogging now , and credit it for leading to a lot of positive things in my life both more tangible , like speaking opportunities at conferences , and less so , like connections made with others i admire doing similar work i think all children and teenagers should have the time and opportunity , not to mention encouragement and support , to pursue their own personally meaningful learning , creation , and work six my education was truly personalized without a pre packaged curriculum , the education my family and i built for myself was truly unique and personalized tailored to my needs , desires , interests , and goals as well as those of my family and community the experiences i ve had , the body of knowledge i ve gained , my skillset , and my portfolio are all truly unique i had , and am continuing to pursue , an education that is like no one else s to me that s one of the greatest strengths of life learning that each individual has a completely unique education , based on their needs and the needs of their family and community as far as i m concerned , a healthy community is best built by people with widely varying experiences , strengths , and skills , and it seems to me that home education , and especially unschooling , is in an excellent position to help do just that there are times i feel less secure in my experiences times of worry and doubt growing up , things certainly weren t perfect , and they aren t perfect now but they were good , and the way i was raised has had such a profound impact on my outlook and how i m choosing to live my life along with the positives i discuss above , i feel like unschooling really helped me develop and gain self knowledge , and that the way i learned and the knowledge and experience i ve gained has been invaluable and that s why i m very glad that i grew up unschooled
