i know i 've been out of touch i just have n't felt like writing lately i 've felt like working i 've felt like running i 've felt like going to meetings i 've even felt like seeing friends but i have n't felt like writing sorry about that it 's a pretty rare occasion when i do n't feel like writing i'm not sure what 's going on i do n't have a lot to say , i guess i'm doing better than i was a few days ago my slumping mood lasted a couple of days thursday was long and tough i got pretty low and pretty lazy friday and saturday were better , but work both days was n't great i did the best i could with my distracted brain i got through as was my hope , the slump passed today i'm okay i'm back in training mode now i have a weight training class every tuesday and thursday morning , and i'm already doing some lengthy runs , like miles , which i ran on sunday the chicago marathon will be here before i know it this weekend d will be here , and we 're running an mile race together on saturday we have n't been together since early july , so i'm anxious to see him i'm sure the weekend will come and go way too quickly it usually does that pretty much covers things as i noted earlier , i just do n't have much to say right now i apologize to those of you looking for more this too shall pass carry on , friends
