i was very excited to have a piece i wrote published on the mighty , which is a great resource for people sharing their personal experiences and lessons learned from dealing with mental illness , disability , and other issues in their own life or a loved one 's the piece was edited , of course , though since i'm a little long winded and maybe got too vindictive ? which made me a little sad it feels like less of my own work so i thought i would publish the original piece here but first , here 's the link to the published article http themighty com things i wish someone told me when i was struggling with depression and below is what i originally sent in a letter to myself a year ago by becca joy i ve been meaning for some time to write a piece reflecting on my experience with a severe bout of depression last year i had struggled with depression since my early adolescence , but a bad reaction to ironically the antidepressant i was taking put me into a worse state of physical and mental depression than i had ever been before , all while living at university several hours from home when i realized that it was this week a year ago that i had to leave college unexpectedly for about a week and go home because things had gotten so bad , i was inspired to write a few things that i wish i could have heard at that time when life looked so bleak people will be oddly silent when you tell them what s going on for real , which is disappointing and hurtful they don t know what to say it is a lot to take in , after all they feel uncomfortable they are young it s lame of them to do and it will make you will feel even lonelier i m so sorry but you are strong and self reliant and there will be a few people who try to help no one can fix you , but eventually you and your family will figure out the changes that need to be made that will help life slowly get better , and though the struggle will never fully fade , you will be a survivor , even if people don t recognize the battle don t forget your own strength and don t let other people s weakness keep you from being honest you have value even if you are ignored , excluded , glossed over , belittled , and rejected even though you like yourself deep down , you question your value and put yourself down because others don t seem to care about you or think you re good enough your mind goes in circles trying to figure out why you didn t get chosen for that club or elected for that office or asked out by that boy why people ignore you or don t seem interested in being friends people can be lame , selfish , and cliquish i m sorry about that , self it really sucks and will frustrate you for the rest of your life but you are strong and talented and you will find your place one day people don t have to recognize your strength and value for it to be true you wouldn t stand to see other people s value belittled , so why do you berate and abuse yourself ? people may even be total jerks sometimes , but that is a reflection on who they are , not who you are the underhanded digs friends sometimes make about how you sleep all the time you know that you can t help how constantly exhausted you feel , that something has changed inside your body so don t let their lack of compassion get to you if they were a real friend , they would be concerned , not critical and that supposed friend who says you don t deserve for a guy to be nice to you just because you re nice to him ? that says a world about what kind of person he is , so don t believe a word of it the guy you like who subtly puts you down for as many times as he says something kind of nice ? he is insecure and immature and you deserve better you were kind and reached out to help all of these people who have insulted and ignored you and that is a reflection on your character don t let others insecurity dictate your value it will be a long journey to healing , and you will lose a lot that is precious to you , but you will also gain so much while it has been undeniably painful to have so many doors closed in your face and you will ultimately have to give up a dream you had and leave the school you had such high hopes for being happy at , you will eventually find new opportunities and blessings in the unexpected detour you are forced to take you will have a story to tell you will develop a more compassionate heart you will learn to live a healthier life you will find new dreams to chase for anyone else out there who is struggling , here are some words i wish i could have heard when i felt there was no hope your life matters you are valuable your life is worth living your problems are legitimate you are not alone you deserve better you are loved
