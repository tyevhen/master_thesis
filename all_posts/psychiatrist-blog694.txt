i 've been thinking we should start a clinical encounters series where psychiatrists can write in with cases and other psychiatrists could give opinions all anonymous , of course clink and roy are n't so sure this is a good idea or they are sure it 's a bad idea ! but i thought i would try a preview with my own confabulated encounter and ask for your insights this one is open to everyone it 's an altered version of something that happened to a shrink friend of mine many years ago , so while the details are disguised , the uneasiness of the situation is not dr mind is a psychiatrist in private practice who is having an embarrassing little problem and he goes to see a urologist he needs a procedure , something quick that can be done in the office on an outpatient basis in comes the nurse to assist dr phallus , the urologist , and the nurse greets dr mind with a smile ah , she is a former patient of dr mind the now very vulnerable patient who does not want this nurse ex patient of his in the room to have any part of his procedure or rather sensitive body parts he 's in quite the pickle here he 's the patient and he has his feelings to consider , but he ca n't exactly divulge to dr phallus , your nurse was my patient and i do n't want her here complete with any incriminating things he might know she 's got a drug problem , she told me stories about her treatment of patients that made me cringe or she 's a wonderful person but he just does n't want her here your thoughts on how dr mind should handle this ?
