this very recent judgment was published on thaugust it concerns tenancy agreements , and the issue of a person s capacity to end , or indeed , to take out a tenancy agreement it also highlights a situation which is covered by neither the mental health act nor the mental capacity act , but requires referral to the court of protection for a decision qr is a woman of she has a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia her first serious episode was in at the age of , and she has had numerous detentions under both sec sec mha since then she was discharged from hospital in december , since when she has been subject to a cto until her most recent admission to hospital , she lived in a local authority flat , and still has the tenancy of this property one of the conditions of the cto is to reside in abc , a residential treatment centre run by the local authority the mental health team now consider that she no longer needs this level of support however , the judge records she must live in accommodation which provides hour support and monitoring , so that qr will continue to be compliant with her medication and avoid the risk of a possibly fatal relapse her team now want her to live in a more independent living situation , but consider that there is too great a risk to her health and safety for her to return to her previous flat however , qr will need to sign a tenancy agreement in order to move into a supported living flat , and must first surrender her existing tenancy in the words of the judge the crux of the case is that qr objects to the application on the grounds that she has capacity to decide whether to surrender the tenancy of her current flat and to sign a tenancy agreement for supported living accommodation she does not wish to surrender the secure tenancy of her council flat which is important to her and she does not wish to move to any of the proposed supported living options which have been proposed the issue the judge had to decide was whether or not qr has the capacity to decide where she should live , to surrender the tenancy of her flat and to sign a new tenancy agreement the issue of capacity is , of course , situation specific a person may have the capacity to decide whether or not to have a cup of tea , but may lack the capacity to make a decision about where they should live in this particular case , the judge concluded that i am satisfied that qr is unable to make the decisions at stake in this case as a result of the nature of her mental illness he went on to say that qr is not able to give weight to the issue of central importance in the arrangements which the mental health team propose , the reason why she needs to take her medication this particular case has not yet reached a conclusion still to be decided is what further evidence if any is required in order that a best interests decision on the issues before the court can be made the implications of this case relate to the issue of the ability of someone with a mental disorder of any sort to either take on a tenancy or to relinquish a tenancy this has often not been considered when making arrangements for people who may lack capacity in certain areas because of learning difficulties , dementia or mental illness from time to time , and for the best possible reasons , professionals working with such people assist them in obtaining accommodation for which that individual will need to make decisions regarding signing or relinquishing a tenancy , and professionals may not consider the issue of whether or not they actually have the capacity to make those decisions while a person can be made subject to conditions in a community treatment order , such as a condition to reside in a certain place , this power does not extend to either terminating a tenancy or taking out a tenancy on their behalf if the person subject to such conditions does not have capacity in that area , then any legal decisions they make may be invalid in such cases , referral to the court of protection appears to be the only remedy
