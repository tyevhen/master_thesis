today has been one of those days i'm big and tired and i feel a little lost i clean the house to have it dirtied just as fast and i wonder why i bother i'm a little sad , but really for no reason today is one of those days where my soul is hungry give me purpose ! i came across this video of a local woman who is also a blogger i 've heard her story before and to see this really touched me she and her husband survived a plane crash and this is a little bit about their life now she was even on oprah at one time no matter what your religion or personal beliefs , there are really great lessons about life and family in this woman 's story just what my heart needed today i really feel it is important to feed our souls daily with inspiration , motivation , or some form of meditation something to help us reflect on the big picture and realign ourselves with the present instead of always living in fear of the future i'm not always good at doing this everyday , but when i do n't , i feel my anxiety swallowing me whole if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like endure it well need a little faith and motivation ? lessons learned patience and determination why me ? linkwithin
