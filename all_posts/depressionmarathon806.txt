when i last left you i was feeling heavy and lazy and bored now i'm feeling sick i 've had a sore throat and a headache for the last couple of days feeling achy and sick certainly does n't combine well with heavy and bored for instance , i promised myself i 'd get out and bike no , okay swim no , okay run today none of the aforementioned occurred oh well , at least puck and i got out for a minute walk i'm trying to be kinder to myself and not fret too much about my temporary lack of motivation i'm trying but i am just a wee bit concerned i think i need to make myself another training schedule , even if i do n't yet know what it is i'm training for maybe i 'll get to that this evening by the way , i'm going on my annual trip to colorado this week i'm going with friends bill and cindy to their cabin again we 're leaving wednesday night , and since we 're driving , puck and puppy their dog get to come along ! yippee ! it will be puck 's first foray into the mountains we will be gone days this year i'm really , really looking forward to it below is a picture of bill , last year , with his morning coffee in front of the cabin of course , when i'm gone i wo n't be able to write as often , but i 'll try to keep you up to date as best i can i 'll also try to get my butt in gear and get some exercise while i'm there i guess i better get to writing up that schedule right now
