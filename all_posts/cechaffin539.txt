below , the next poem in the second section of sine wave i wrote this in on a grayhound bus in heading to toledo , ohio from moorhead , mn , in the pre dawn on the bus ii ohio dawn a mist lies over the lake like a blanket of visible breath outside my tinted window and a line of inky clouds spells something in dabs and blots along the orange horizon to the west , monotonous clumps of monochrome trees are ruled by undifferentiated blue metallically foul , though pure , the smell of a skunk seeps through i find it strangely addictive somewhere along this stream beavers slap mud on sticks , waiting for ice to form where is the emperor with his hundred year old cricket to explain these sleeping faces ? a water tower looms , its hydrocephalic head perched on a steel stem like a rigid pollywog and i am a talking fish in search of a species with ears i must see to the heart of things whether you do or not published in the adirondack review i incidentally entered the ms in two contests last month contests that charge you money , of course , which always makes me suspicious that it might be a scam one contest used my entry fee to allow me to pick one of their publications and there , to my surprise , was a book by a winner of the contest who was my former student so ordered her book maybe i teach better than i write other good news the deprivathon was accepted by a venerable old e zine that antedated melic and continues i 'll reveal the name when alle ist in ordnung of the ten zines i queried , only this one responded to me in less than ten weeks maybe others dread telling me how much my work sucks maybe i'm on the cusp , made the first cut damned by faint praise ? maybe they 're lazy and like to publish their friends maybe nothing , something , it 's all possible in the wacky world of writers i 've also got a poem coming out in the philadelphia enquirer book review today , so if any of you live back east and can get me a copy and mail it to my address , i 'd be much obliged c e chaffin p o box fort bragg , ca i think i mentioned my essay in the redwood review ? local literary mag niederngasse took another love poem from me what else ? just waiting for feedback by editors who have not answered my mood is holding saw a special on my spirit guide , the raven , tonight in one sequence a lady 's pet raven actually hopped into the front of her car and turned off the ignition they steal from eagles and live forty years i 've wanted a raven for a long time , i think i 'll look into it i want him to say stupid things so i do n't look as much the jerk he 'll improve my social standing my feathery , abrasive mouthpiece i 'll turn you into the don rickles of ravens and we shall all live to forget it i have poems on ravens , maybe tomorrow love to all who have been through this horror with me each day i can feel hope i know i am not in the clutches of demon melancholy though he still seems just outside the door at this juncture ca n't afford to be overconfident thine in hoped for humility , ce
