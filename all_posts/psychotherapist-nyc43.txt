most people tend to focus on what they consider their weaknesses and forget to consider their personal strengths when they go through stressful times , focusing on where they feel deficient makes it much more stressful for them in this article , i'm proposing that focusing on your personal strengths will help you more during difficult times for this article , i'm using the terms personal strengths and internal resources interchangeably seems article discovering your personal strengths and developing internal resources and coping skills focusing on your personal strengths to cope with stressful times identifying your personal strengths everyone has personal strengths whether they focus on them or not your personal strengths are what 's going to help you to cope with stress not the areas where you feel deficient so , it 's important to harness those inner resources to reduce your stress and resolve your problems unfortunately , so many people are unable to identify their personal strengths they 're so focused on being critical of themselves that they forget all the wonderful qualities that they possess that have gotten them through rough times in the past rather than focusing on their internal resources , they worry and project their fears into the future so , not only are they worried about what 's happening in the current situation , but they 're also projecting and predicting problems in the future problems that might never come if you tend to project negative outcomes , think about all the times when you did this in the past and how often your projections came true if you 're like most people , your negative projections occurred only a fraction of the time that means that you spent a lot of time and effort worrying for no reason should you completely ignore your weaknesses ? does this mean that you should completely ignore about your weaknesses ? the short answer is no , especially if they 're having an adverse effect on your life focusing on your strengths , but do n't completely ignore your weaknesses for instance , if your manager tells you that you 're doing a great job with most of your responsibilities , but you really need to improve your presentation skills , you 're not going to ignore this because it would be detrimental to your job you 're going to find out what you can do to improve your presentation skills and then do it or , if your spouse tells you that you tend to zone out with your phone when she talks and she would appreciate your being more present , are you going to ignore your wife 's request ? no , you 're going to make an effort to put down your phone more often so you can be fully present when you talk to each other so , i'm not proposing that you only focus exclusively on your strengths all the time without trying to make improvements in the areas where you could stand to improve what i'm saying is that many people only focus on their weaknesses , and they could use some balance in their approach how to focus on your strengths to cope with stressful times think about how you got through difficult times in the past the easiest way to focus on your strengths when you 're under stress is to think about past memories when you succeeded in getting through hard times which inner resources allowed you to get through a challenging time ? write about the personal strengths that helped you in the past if you 're struggling to identify the personal strengths that got you through , take a few minutes to write about it writing helps to clarify your thoughts and concretize your ideas do n't spend time being critical of your writing this exercise is only for you no one else needs to see it focusing on your personal strengths write about the personal strengths that helped you in the past write about how these same inner resources can help you now very often , the personal strengths that got you through in the past are the same strengths that can help you now it 's a matter of remembering and using them again speak to your loved ones it 's often the case that loved ones can see and remember the personal strengths that helped you in the past long after you 've forgotten about them so , if you have trusted family and friends who saw you through difficult times in the past , ask them what they observed about you you might be surprised to hear what they have to say write it down before you forget what if you 're too stressed out to focus on your personal strengths ?
