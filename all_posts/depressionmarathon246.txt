life is moving forward i'm hanging on for the very slow ride i'm feeling a little better maybe ? actually , i'm not sure at least i'm not feeling worse i'm hanging in there , i think i continue to work hours every other day it 's been a bit overwhelming , especially at the start of each day , but once i 've gotten going my patients have kept me distracted my exercise has slowed again , but i did get a run walk in tonight i ran minutes and walked minute for a total of miles that was my first run this week it was n't much , and it was slow , but i did it even though i felt like staying on the sofa i see my doctor tomorrow she 's thinking of changing my meds that process scares me , but i'm willing to do anything to feel better this has been a long , slow stretch of not feeling entirely well , and i'm getting tired but i'm hanging on , moving slowly forward , trying not to fall off the ride hang in there with me , my friends
