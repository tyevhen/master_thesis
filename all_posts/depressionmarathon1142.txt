an unwelcome anniversary is approaching in a few days , it will be two years since my year old friend , kathy , tragically died after falling down her basement stairs kathy was an rn at generose , east , mayo clinic 's adult psychiatric inpatient unit that 's where we met she was my primary nurse during my first admission to her unit as my primary nurse , she spent a lot of time with me , and we quickly developed a bond through multiple admissions over years , kathy and i continued to cross paths we developed a special bond nothing inappropriate , all professional boundaries were maintained , but she became a friend , a confidant , a mentor a mother figure i trusted , respected and admired her she was a hell of a nurse , and i'm sure she was a a very special wife , daughter , sister and friend kathy was not supposed to die she was supposed to be around to see me get well she would be elated with my sobriety she would be proud of the person i 've become i never envisioned a future without kathy in it when she died , we had n't spoken for several months , but that made her no less a part of my life i knew she was there i knew she would celebrate with me in victory and always support me in defeat i just had to pick up the phone she was there , and then she was gone senseless , tragic , shocking gone why god ? why ? there is a huge void in my life where kathy once stood knowing she was there comforted and supported me i did n't need to see her or speak to her to know and feel that now i wish i had seen and spoken with her more to say i think of her often does n't even come close i still look to her for guidance almost daily but she 's no longer here , and that makes me very , very sad i never told her how special she was i took her availability for granted she was n't supposed to die there is a huge void in my life where kathy once stood i am grateful to have known her , but i miss her i miss her so , so much she was n't supposed to die
