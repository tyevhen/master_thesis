i'm busy getting ready for christmas that process has been made easier , as i 've slowly been on the mend from my low energy and mood i'm so relieved i'm always worried the depression symptoms , once present , are going to drag on forever of course , they never do bad days are always followed by better days eventually even last year at this time , when i was fresh out of my fifth hospitalization in three months , the bad days did eventually dissipate i think i helped myself mend a bit quicker from this low episode i was reminded of a dialectical behavioral therapy skill called radical acceptance last thursday , lying on my sofa , unable to move , feeling desperate and hopeless , i reached for the phone i explained to my therapist how i should n't be feeling this low not me not now i should be feeling better i should have more energy i should be exercising rather than lying on the sofa with so many good things going on in my life , i should n't be feeling hopeless and sad blah , blah , blah you get the idea instead of dealing with my reality , i was fighting it tooth and nail i was should ing myself to death rather than accepting my symptoms as part of my depression , i was treating them like character defects for example , rather than resting when i felt tired , i laid down and admonished myself for laying there i was incredulous that i had so little energy rather than remembering and accepting that i almost never have energy when i'm low i was treating myself with less than kindness instead i was forcing stereotypes on myself how could i have symptoms when there were good , even exciting things going on in my life ? umm because depression is an illness , and just like other illnesses , it can rear it 's ugly head at any time ? geez i think i just made a video addressing this stuff ! i got off the phone and turned my mind i worked on radically accepting where i was at , staying in just that moment , and doing what i could and or needed to do at just that time at that moment is was taking a nap ! it took a couple of days , and lots of reminders , but i began to feel better whenever a should or should n't statement came to mind , i stopped it and went back to accepting the moment it was what it was that 's all with this illness , we already face plenty of judgments , i certainly did n't need to pile on more of them , yet that 's exactly what i was doing should and should n't statements did nothing to relieve my depression symptoms accepting where i was at and working on just that moment gave me some power and control in what otherwise felt like a powerless situation i'm working hard to rid should and should n't from my vocabulary
