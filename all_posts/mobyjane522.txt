dear a b curtiss just happened to read your review of 'this is not the life i ordered' this phrase leaped out at me people mistakenly think they are depressed because of their problems but , in fact , they are always depressed because of their depression a light bulb went off when i read it i 've been collecting helpful quotes , such as this by milton the mind is its own place , and in itself can make a heav'n of hell , a hell of heav'n your quote will be added to the list ! c b dear c b thanks so much for your note have you read either of my two depression books ? the first one , depression is a choice is the philosophy of how to get out of the mind habits that set you up for depression and other dependencies the second one , brainswitch out of depression , tells you exactly how your brain works , and how you get from one thought to another , so you can be the responsible driver rather than the unwitting passenger of your brain a b curtiss dear a b although my current depressed state is caused by illness mine and my husband 's and i usually do not suffer from depression , now that i know about your books i will add them to my amazon shopping list one or both may well prove very useful in the future dear c b if you have any questions as you read the books , i will be glad to answer them for you i am a board certified cognitive behavioral therapist and although i do not take private patients any longer , i answer anyone 's questions via email i do not charge for this a b curtiss
