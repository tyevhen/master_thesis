after a long meeting with my regular psychiatrist yesterday afternoon , i agreed to reconsider ect in fact , i resumed outpatient ect this morning so today was my seventh ect treatment i'm hoping for no more than total treatments , but we 'll see how it goes to say i'm ambivalent about this course of action is an understatement , but i trust my doctor we had a good discussion of the pros and cons of ect versus continuing on my current path of misery in the end , i agreed with her i cannot continue feeling as desperate and despondent as i 've been feeling without risking my life it 's as simple as that fortunately , my parents are in town for another couple of weeks , so they are able to assist me with getting to and from my treatments my mom stayed with me today while i slept off the remainder of the anesthesia it 's late afternoon , and i'm just starting to feel normal again i guess i 'll only be training running on tuesday , thursday and saturday for the next couple weeks a slight disruption of my training schedule will be a minor inconvenience , however my bigger concern is for my memory ect severely disrupts my memory i 've written down my passwords , and i'm going to try to be vigilant about documenting conversations and life events over these next few weeks if i do n't , i 'll be lost , and i hate that feeling i'm praying that i'm doing the right thing by resuming ect with how poorly i 've been feeling , i think it 's about the best option i have left hopefully it will work as it has in the past to get me back on track and hopefully i do n't get too stupid in the process your continued prayers are certainly appreciated
