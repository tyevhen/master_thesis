hi friends ! i hope you are well ! this next affordable art nursery print was inspired by my love of elephants it 's that simple this one is paige 's very favorite she yelled i want that in my room ! when i showed it to her we hung it right over her nightstand so she can look at it all the time what 's great about this print is that it is gender neutral and works in a girl 's nursery or a boy 's nursery i also have a thing for yellow , so that does n't hurt i think i 'll also turn this one into a birthday party fill in invitation with matching thank you notes i'm always plotting and planning ! check it out at the meandwee etsy shop ! save
