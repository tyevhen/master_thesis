i received a nice message a few days ago apparently healthline com is promoting a contest to find the best health blog , and my little blog has been nominated how cool is that ? there 's even prize money ! i'm humbled and honored i'm honored , but i have no expectation i will finish in the money i'm a little gal in a big world of bloggers i do n't twitter i do n't facebook i'm not even very knowledgeable about the ways of the internet i'm a little fish in what has become a very big pond , and i'm okay with that when i created this blog in , there was n't a lot of first person information about depression on the internet i could n't find what i needed , so i began this blog a lot of people turned up their noses when i told them i was going to blog about depression despite their misgivings , i began to write anyway i wanted to educate people about mental illness and stigma i also wanted to share my experience , strength and hope quality of life is possible despite having depression i hope those who happen upon depression marathon find something of value i hope sharing my experience is helpful to others , but the secret is i actually help myself every time i sit here and type i'm as surprised as anyone that i'm still typing after all these years i do n't know what i expected when i began , but i'm pretty sure i never imagined i 'd still be writing almost years later i never imagined many people would read anything i wrote either that being said , if you 're reading this , feel free to vote here ! voting begins november st and runs through december th and if you feel strongly , you may even vote once per day ! regardless of the outcome , i appreciate the recognition by you , my readers , and by healthline com thank you
