it 's been a long hard winter and i'm glad spring is coming ! i seem to be fighting those familiar negative thoughts a lot recently is that person staring at me those people are whispering about me so and so thinks i'm stupid he does not like me i think they are all irrational and a little paranoid but i do wish they would go away fighting them and distracting myself takes an awful lot of effort i am still only on mg of aripiprazole and as the side effects seem to have gone away i am wondering if i might be better off with a slightly higher dose as originally planned i have another appointment with the psychiatrist in a few weeks and this will be my first question otherwise i am doing well , my flat is tidy , i'm quite organised and generally getting on with life it 's just everything is taking just a little bit more effort i must admit it is nice being able to getup inthe mornings again o my parents are coming to stay this weekend and i have put on so much weight i have decided to join weight watchers the first meet is tomorrow morning
