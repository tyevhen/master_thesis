about ten days ago , i was in a bad position and had to really push , pull and strain to get up in the process , pulled or did something to a groin muscle it did not feel good then and the next day it was even worse when i found myself sitting on the throne after that , i had to be extra careful not to do any more damage as those of you living with a neuromuscular disorder know , it is difficult not to use your abdominal and groin muscles to help push yourself to a standing position also , several exercises i perform are to strengthen , or maintain , the abdominal and groin muscles several times every day , these muscles have to be used to one degree or another over the last few days , the pull , or tear , still tends to let me know it is not healed , but at least it is something i can live with it is also a reminder that we have to consider our current situation and capabilities before performing certain acts that would not even be a consideration for someone without a progressive disorder leverage is how we accomplish much of what we do today , but even that has its limits on a side note , last week s weather wasn t a much fun even though i live in the south we had a lot of rain , some snow , ice , and very cold temperatures , but nothing like the eastern seaboard experienced the last nor easter i was involved in was when we lived in philadelphia my wife and i shoveled four times one day and woke up the next morning to mph winds with the new snow and drifts , we had another three feet to shovel we were exhausted , sore and ready to move south i hope our eastern friends are dug out and waiting for spring i know i am photo snowtree jpg by penywise
