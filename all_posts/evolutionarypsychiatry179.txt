at the beginning of this year , an interesting french study was published , changes in brain activity after a diet induced obesity do n't get too excited they used pigs , not humans , specifically mini pigs , which sound awesome in short , they put two sets of pigs on either standard pig crap lab diet with controlled calories to keep them lean , or a crap lab diet with extra carb and extra fat ad libitum for months they did spect scans of the pigs' brains before and after , and also in a separate paper were able to determined that the now obese pigs had insulin resistance first , though , let 's start with some human data and take a tour of some parts of the brain let 's introduce ourselves to the prefrontal cortex okay , so when tom naughton does his head bangs on his desk , i'm guessing he 's whacking his prefrontal cortex which we are going to call the pfc it 's the area that hangs out over your eyes fortunately this habit has not seemed to harm his brain function , if his recent terrific articles are any measure now the prefrontal cortex is more developed and extensive in humans than any other primate , and it is responsible for what is called executive function that is , the pfc helps us predict outcomes , prioritize , modulate our emotions to socially acceptable norms , and helps us sort out the best options given conflicting data reasoning , basically it is a bit like a policeman for your brain sure , it would be super fun to get drunk as a skunk and throw beer bottles off your roof at the neighbors but your policeman says , er , no , that might get you in trouble drinking alcohol , in fact , disinhibits the pfc which enables you to ask out the girl you would n't have approached sober of course , if you are making a selection with impaired reasoning , the girl you ask out might not look quite so good to you sober but back to obesity our brains do play a major role in whether we gain fat or not and part of what happens in obese humans is that the prefrontal cortex seems to be less active than in lean humans this finding is especially interesting in obesity , as the pfc sends nerve fibers to the core appetite regulation part of the brain the central orexigenic network presumably , when fully active , the policeman is shaking his night stick at you when you want to go to the fridge for that second helping of ice cream nuh uh you have had enough if the policeman is offline , it may be easier to consume extra helpings i'm not sure i like the policeman analogy so much too close to lack of willpower or gluttony and sloth , but it does fit into the model of weird modern food poisoning our brains , so that the reasoning piece of our appetite regulation machinery is shot now the question is , obviously do obese humans start out with underactive pfcs , or is it acquired along with obesity ? well , women who were obese with underactive pfcs regained their frontal lobe function with successful weight loss this evidence would suggest that underactive pfcs are n't hard wired , but depend upon the environment , including nutrition however , a study going the opposite direction starting with lean humans and making some obese with controlled overfeeding for an extended period is a tough sell to the institutional review board these days so it is easier to use mini pigs , who also seem to have particularly well developed pfcs let 's look at the experiment pigs , kept lean and made obese one of the spect scans in one of the obese pigs was unusable so the data is for lean and obese the standard diet was composed of barley , wheat bran , soy shell , wheat , sunflower meal , soy meal , and other minor components fat provided of the total nutritional value well , if in much of pig evolutionary history they were set loose in a warehouse of a cardiologist 's favorite power bar ingredients , perhaps this is what the minipigs would eat these days and stay nice and lean and metabolic syndrome free in this experiment the pigs were fed calories per kilogram each morning , and the pigs dutifully ate their swill in one meal and did their piggy things and stayed lean since calories are calories though i will get back to the standard diet later now the obese diet eight animals were fed with a western diet wd enriched with carbohydrates and lipids offered ad libitum during months one ration offered at hours and calculated to exceed daily calorie consumption of the animals the wd was composed of wheat , soy meal , wheat bran , barley , sunflower oil , cornstarch , saccharose , and other minor components fat provided of the total nutritional value gak ! enough said i wonder if this was that high oleic sunflower oil anyway the results of the experiment well , one interesting thing is that the dietary pattern of the fattening pigs changed the control pigs ate all their food at once , each morning , but as the western diet pigs became more obese they would eat meals a day , and then spontaneously fast for a day or several days by the end of the months , the lean pigs weighed kg on average which is about where they started the obese pigs weighed kg that 's pretty impressive for five months the day before the final brain imaging , the lean pigs ate calories each , and the obese pigs ate calories each and , as expected , the brains of the obese pigs did indeed have decreased activity in the pfc , both in the dorsolateral prefrontal areas and the anterior prefrontal cortex in addition , there was a lessening of activity in some brain areas associated with the reward system specifically the nucleus accumbens , the ventral tegmentum , and the nucleus pontis , which is consistent with the addiction literature people who are addicted to something have less activation of the reward areas of the brain in response to the addictive stimulus than people who are not addicted thus addicted people need more and more of the stimulus to feel reward a key finding is that the decreased activation of the pfc correlated significantly with the final weight of the pigs so the more obese they became , the more depressed their pfc function tended to be so , we have learned that in mini pigs , sunflower oil , wheat bran , cornstarch , and sacchralose is a quick recipe for obesity , and that pigs on a similar diet minus so much cornstarch and oil will stay the same weight as long as you feed them controlled calories which is something of a weakness of the study if they were trying to prove that sunflower oil and starch make you fat , which they were n't , but it would have been interesting to see what happened if both groups were fed ad libitum so , in all likelihood , given the corresponding human data in the reverse trial and observationally , the pfc does indeed play an important role in feeding signals and hunger satiety states and i 'll quote the researchers here whether the alteration of the brain dopamine system and prefrontal cortex metabolism is a cause or a consequence of obesity is still unknown the answer brought by our study is that less activation of the prefrontal cortex is definitely an acquired anomaly related to obesity , and not a hard wired feature i framed that sentence the way the mini pig paper did , using regained frontal lobe function however , in the original paper the womens' frontal lobe function was not measured prior to the weight loss , so it is also possible that the women who successfully lost weight were a subset who had better frontal lobe function but in that study the obese women had decreased pfc metabolism , the lean and formerly obese women had pfc metabolism indistinguishable from each other also for more dopamine frontal lobe obesity discussion a post from last year , adhd and obesity
