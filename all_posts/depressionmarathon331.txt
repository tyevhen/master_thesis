the weather around here continues to be so challenging , i changed my long run from saturday morning to this morning instead it 's supposed to be frigid tomorrow with heavy , gusting winds today was not much better , but it was slightly warmer degrees when i started out and less windy than tomorrow 's forecasted weather but it was still damn cold and windy for a mile long run ! i began with layers of high tech clothing on top and layers on my legs , but after miles i was so cold i had to loop back home and add another layer i also had to change from my running mittens into my heavy snowblowing leather mitts i think that may be more clothing than i 've ever run in previously the added layers made the wind and cold more tolerable for the rest of my run despite the cold and wind , i did finish all miles today i'm happy about that it was a challenge my legs were tired , as i 've already run quite a few miles this week , as scheduled i ran out of gas around mile , but i took in a carbohydrate gel and some water , which perked me up i finished feeling tired but fairly good this was my first miler in preparation for the boston marathon in april i 've got two more milers before race day this was also my first miler since last fall , prior to my most recent depression episode i reflected on that fact after i finished i'm so grateful to be running and training again in october , november and december , i could n't imagine ever running milers again it 's really remarkable to be back at it i 've come a long way over the past two and a half months for that , i am amazed and grateful it reminds me once again everything is temporary if i ever relapse into the darkness again , this will be a good fact to keep in mind
