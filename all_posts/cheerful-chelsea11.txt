for a long time i was n't able to see the progress i was making in my recovery it required a lot of energy , effort and mental soundness for me to even leave the house i 'd go out to walk my dog in a beautiful wooded area , i was ready to fill my lungs with fresh air to blow through the cobwebs that had accumulated over many months despite the seemingly serene picture i 've painted for you , i 'd feel overwhelmbed by the wind catching the leaves , the creeks of the trees and the dizzying green canopy that threatened to fall down on my head i 'd somehow begin to feel claustrophobic in the most natural , open spaces despite those suffocating moments threatening to jeopardise any progress i was making , i eventually managed to see that i was achieving things they were small steps , perhaps not monumental victories but they all accumulate towards feeling better not long ago i would have been consumed by what seemed like a failed outing and would have trudged upstairs , drawn the curtains and shut myself vements away for hours , sometimes days now i can see that i managed the following i left the house , i may have driven to the national trust site for the walk , i took my dog on a walk , i walked a fair distance after being static on the sofa for months on end it 's easy for these things to be overlooked for most people they are seemingly easy actions and sound like a pretty uneventful day for those with mental illness they can be the biggest achievements you 've noticed for a long time there was a time when i had a sticker chart to reward actions like having a shower , getting properly dressed or putting on a fresh set of pyjamas to some that might sound pathetic screw those people i needed that sticker chart in those days , and i still do despite being able to achieve solo dog walks , driving somewhere without having planned the trip in every detail the day beforehand or even managing to kickstart my exercise routines , there are still days when i fall down and feel as if i'm a nobody , that my life is meaningless and that i'm a massive nuisance and liability to all those in my life i 've become a huge fan of the day habit cards made by the same people that produce the happiness planners i started off with small goals such as eating breakfast every day , i was pretty bad at feeding myself for a long time ! if i jumped to setting myself goals that were too big i could definitely tell , there would be days between me earning a sticker on the chart and that was an easy indicator that i was n't ready to be pushing myself that hard yet i 've since managed to maintain a regular chart for exercising months ago i would have struggled to workout once a week since march i 've been exercising up to times a week , sometimes more , sometimes twice a day ! i always make a note of my start date on the habit cards so i can see how quickly i filled up the cards upon completion of each habit card i will keep them as a record for me to look back on , a nice reminder to have as your collection grows as you make progress and also a reminder of how much you are capable of achieving if you have another down period the day habit cards are availbale here if you are a new customer of the website you can get off your first purchase !
