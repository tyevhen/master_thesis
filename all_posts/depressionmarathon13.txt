i 've located the jerk who has been copying , word for word , my entire blog the jerk has re posted all of my material , again , word for word , in his her own blog it 's so ridiculous ! many of my posts from , which have been copied and re posted , pertain to running in minnesota , with minnesota mentioned time and again this jerk 's blog is based out of indonesia i do n't get it i just do n't get it ! why would you create a blog , halfway across the world , and then copy the , almost , year old life story of somebody else ? how low and pathetic is that ? i 've contacted the offender , and as politely as i could , asked him her to remove all of my original content as far as i can tell , that would be their entire blog i 've also sent in the evidence to google hopefully that will result in the plagiarist 's site being shut down as you can tell , i'm extremely frustrated and angry about this i just do n't understand the motive of reproducing another person 's blog does the jerk think he she is going to make some money off my words ? that would be pretty amazing i mean , i'm not making any money doing this ! and if it is n't for money , what in the world motivates someone to do this ? it 's just pathetic and maddening and it ca n't be resolved soon enough
