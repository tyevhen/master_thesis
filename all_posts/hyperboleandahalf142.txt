note i swear on my mother that this is a factual account except that brian is n't actually retarded i think as an year old , i had not yet fully grasped the concept of mortality or how my actions could increase or decrease my likelihood of experiencing it when i was invited to go boat camping with four guys and a pack of natural ice , i was all for it you might think you have some idea of how this story ends based on that last sentence , but trust me , you do n't if it was possible to have any premonition of what was about to happen to me , even my stupid year old brain would have opted out but no one ever expects to end up sleeping on a pee stained mattress in some meth addict 's yard maybe i should go back a little and explain it was my friend geoff 's boat geoff , joey , brian and willie had decided to drive it out to a tiny , secluded island red x on map that was surrounded by jagged rocky cliffs a place where no cops could find us and reprimand us for our underage drinking we loaded all of our stuff onto the boat and set out toward our square foot section of paradise it took about minutes to drive the boat out there we set up camp on the rocky beach and cracked into our overly abundant alcohol supply i had only been drunk once before and i did not yet know how to pace myself just as the sun was starting to set , we got a phone call from a friend back on the mainland how we had cell service on our island , i will never know , but i do know that there is no cell service in the middle of the lake the friend wanted to come to our island she wanted to be picked up i was so drunk , that i agreed to be a passenger on a boat driven by an even more drunk friend again , you may think you have some idea of where this is going , but i assure you that you do not we drove safely all the way back to the marina , where our friend was waiting she decided that she did n't want to come camping after all we were too drunk to be mad we turned the boat around and set off across the water to our unmarked , unlit camping site in the dark that would have been a good enough adventure on its own , but we ended up mired in another problem entirely halfway across the lake approximate location of yellow x on the map , our boat ran out of gas now , this particular lake , as you may have surmised from the part where i said it took us minutes to get to our island , is very , very large see attached map so large that all we could see around us were tiny specks of light on the distant shore brian was passed out , so he did n't care we sat in silence for a few minutes , each contemplating our respective fates as best we could under the influence of way too much beer well , geoff finally ventured i have an oar an oar one we took turns well , everyone except for brian sitting on the bow and rowing we rowed for hours lakes are really cold at night and i was wearing only a swimsuit , so i had to wrap myself in life jackets to keep warm at least i was safe from drowning , at least at approximately am we reached land blue x on map the land we reached was the bank of a highway near a bridge i was told to stay in the boat and protect brian the other boys would go try to find gas somewhere an hour later by my calculations , which could be totally skewed by lapses in consciousness the boys returned with two mangy looking men i remember actually being able to taste the terror in the back of my mouth maybe it was just bile i do n't know whatever it was , it tasted terrible and it did n't make me any less nervous about the tattooed strangers that were quietly assessing my swimsuit lifejacket clad body like curators at a museum it was later explained to me that the boys did not realize they had left their wallets on the island until they had walked all the way to a gas station and pumped gas into their gas can they had been drunkenly haggling with the attendant , when two upstanding young drug addicts appeared out of nowhere and gave them an offer they could n't refuse a free place to sleep as opposed to staying on the boat ? we left the boat tied to a pointy rock and followed the two men up the embankment and along the highway we could n't have gone far because i am sure someone had to carry brian we eventually ended up at their house which was basically an old barn that smelled like drain cleaner and failure the leader of the two men pointed to a dilapidated pup tent that was half buried in garbage and unruly weeds apparently we were supposed to sleep there all five of us climbed into the one man tent and tried to sleep on the urine soaked children 's mattress that had been provided for us i do n't know if i actually slept or just passed out , but around in the morning , we were shaken awake by the gnarliest of the two men he said give me thirty five dollars wha ? was the collective response from the urine tent i said , give me thirty five dollars for rent it became clear that the man expected us to pay for our stay in his excrement coated tent drug addicts are remarkably resourceful at coming up with extra income ! thinking quickly , or perhaps just telling the truth , joey said we do n't have our wallets right now we 'll pay you in the morning this seemed to satisfy the man he stumbled away an hour passed brian started to regain consciousness we filled him in on why he was in a foul smelling tent in some meth head 's backyard he told us that he had his wallet on the boat it was hidden so no one would steal it we were simultaneously furious and very pleased with brian we ventured a peek outside the tent one of the men was lying face down in the grass we could n't see the other man geoff snuck out to go find brian 's wallet , fill up the gas can and retrieve the boat he came back a little while later in the boat he killed the engine and drifted quietly to shore he motioned for us to climb aboard we stumbled as quietly as we could into the boat geoff started the engine , which woke up the man in the yard he looked at us groggily we tried to back out of the dock quickly , before the man could wrap his drug weathered brain around the fact that he was not going to get his thirty five dollars the man staggered to his feet like a wounded mammoth and began to bellow something like f ckers ! you have my money ! it was hard to tell because he was slurring his speech we got the boat going just soon enough we drove to the nearest marina and filled up the rest of the tank we drove the boat back to our island in the broad daylight you may think that the adventure is over but it 's not when we got there , joey , willie , geoff and i wanted to go to sleep brian had other plans he felt bad for passing out and not being able to tell us where his wallet was , so he became hell bent on cooking us breakfast now would be a good time for me to tell you a little bit more about brian the name brian is an anagram of the word brain which is ironic because brian has always teetered between self aware but slow and fully retarded not literally , but almost he just lacks even an iota of common sense he is the kind of person that gets a 's in school but turns around and tries to cook baked beans on a portable barbecue grill , not pausing to consider the incongruity between the size of baked beens and the size of the spaces between grill slats and he did just that after trying to open the beans by smashing them against a rock and looking surprised when of them splattered all over the place , brian proceeded to pour the beans on the grill when that did not produce the results he had envisioned in his head , he switched his focus to cooking bean smoked hotdogs twenty of them i do n't know why he thought we needed twenty hotdogs i do n't even know why we brought twenty hotdogs with us , but that is not the point the point is that we decided to leave brian alone and go to sleep in the tent while he figured out how to cook us something ten minutes later we awoke to brian yelling guys ? hey guys ! you guys ! guys um guys ? ! ! in an increasingly panicked tone we poked our heads out of the tent the island was on fire brian had decided to grill our twenty hotdogs in the shade of one of the three pine saplings on the island we think he may have poured lighter fluid directly onto them , but we ca n't be sure at any rate , he did not consider that fire plus low hanging branches equals burning not only that he was trying to put the fire out with the left over beer by the time we realized what was happening , we could do nothing but stand there and watch the foliage on our precious island burn to the ground and that is the story of how i got stranded in a boat , slept behind a meth lab and played a part in burning down an island all in one night
