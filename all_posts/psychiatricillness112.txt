i'm feeling a bit better today i walked into town and finished my christmas shopping i still fill with dread and anxiety when i think about work i think i will just try and knuckle down and think about practical tasks which i need to complete i might make the list tomorrow so i will be focused on monday morning i have taken out unemployment redundancy cover for my mortgage it is a bit of reassurance for some of the anxieties in my head
