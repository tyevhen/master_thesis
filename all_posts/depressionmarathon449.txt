i do n't have much to report today my life , after all , is not that interesting it 's fairly routine , but it 's just that routine which keeps me moving forward , i guess today was relatively quiet and relaxing after reading and napping the morning away , i had a good mid afternoon run i'm just finishing up my third week of training for grandma 's , which is in mid june the weather has been cooperative lately , allowing me to continue avoiding the dreaded treadmill the fresh air is good for me , and i 'd much rather run outside to complement my running , i just signed up for a strength training class which uses kettleballs and a suspension system it 's an eight week class , monday and wednesday evenings , beginning next week it 's circuit training , so there will be cardiovascular and strength benefits , which will hopefully speed up my running pace i'm really looking forward to it i have n't done any strength training since my last marathon in early december it 's time to get back into it jet is doing well he received a clean report from the veterinarian last week , which was great news he comes to work with me just about every day he 's so cute , and he loves people , so the nursing home residents and my coworkers love having him around he spends most of the day silently lying in his kennel , but i take him out to greet anyone who requests it it 's really nice for both of us i think it 's helped our bonding , and it 's definitely helped him socialize with a variety of people let 's see i ca n't think of anything else pertinent to report like i said , my life is fairly routine and that 's okay drama is way overrated ! i'm okay with routine in fact , i'm grateful for it
