it was an absolutely beautiful day for a marathon i used the occasion of today 's med city marathon to run the affiliated mile training run running my training run alongside racers , i was a bit concerned i would go out too fast and race rather than train i did run a little too fast in several of the early miles , but mostly i held myself in check the bigger goal , however , was to run around minutes per mile and feel good while doing it unfortunately , that goal i did not meet by the mile mark , i knew it was going to be a long day my legs were tired and tight unusual for me i do n't usually tighten up , especially that early i was able to maintain my pace , but i definitely did not feel good one pit stop and several walking stretching breaks brought my overall finishing pace down to per mile that pace did n't bother me it was , after all , only a training run however , i was very concerned with how poorly i felt running that pace i was both physically and mentally tired today as a dress rehearsal , this miler was definitely a flop if i want to qualify for boston four weeks from now , i will need to run much faster than per mile and run for more miles than i ran today i do n't think i could have run more miles today even if i had wanted to , and i did n't want to ! the physical and mental fatigue , the difficulty of the slow pace , and the aching in my legs and feet were each concerning it was a tough day i'm trying not to fret too much tough days happen i know that adopting the positive spin , i was able to maintain my pace despite feeling so tough i guess that 's one good thing it 's so much nicer , however , when i can maintain my pace and feel good ! i'm trying not to fret too much having a tough day today does n't necessarily mean i'm not ready to run a faster marathon right ? but i am concerned
