today , i have no positivity , no do better next time , and no encouragement for anyone else i am questioning everything i am miserable i am ready to quit is this just a bump in the road ? is this what they call a setback or growing pains ? it feels like more i guess i ve always known that i would have to struggle with depression and anxiety for the rest of my life but these last several weeks have taken a turn for the worse i thought i was managing well i thought i had coping skills for this kind of thing but , nothing seems to be going right at least , nothing seems to be going my way i know this difficulty is rooted in the fact that i feel too fat to be loved and too fat to do the things i want to do it s time to lose weight i ll be happy again when i am thin these lies are relentless and i am so tired of fighting them how do i know when enough is enough ? what if my symptoms get worse ? will i know if i should go back on the medication ? i really don t want to go back to the way i was if you ve noticed , i haven t been blogging as much lately because , well , i haven t been doing very well life is tough for me at the moment i feel like i must always end my posts on a positive note , with some kind of encouragement , or resolution to do better so , i feel like i shouldn t be posting at all right now hang with me as i go through this whatever it is hopefully i ll find it back whatever it was prayers are appreciated i ll be praying for you too
