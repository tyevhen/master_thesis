a while back , i put up a youtube video that i thought was funny a commenter did n't like it and felt it promoted stigma so i took a vote , and while most people were fine with it , a number did not like it , and i took the post down we received this note , and i thought it was substantial enough to be it 's own guest post with permission , of course hi i am a practicing psychiatrist based in new york city i find your blog interesting , informative , and , at times , funny now , can you guess which entry i 'd like to comment on ? mel brooks once said , paraphrased , that if you slip on a banana peel and land on your butt , it 's comedy if i fall down a flight of stairs , it 's tragedy i 've had a long term interest in humor , and a brief career as an unpaid stand up comic in l a brief because my bombing to killing ratio was about to one with respect to my experience as a therapist , i now occasionally utilize humor in my treatment , but only extremely judiciously , once i have gotten to know my client i learned my lesson early at the beginning of my residency training , during my second session with a client , i commented that perhaps he felt like groucho marx when groucho said that he would n't want to be a member of any club with standards low enough to accept him i sat back , feeling as if i had made the interpretation of the century , and waited for a reaction i got one the client stormed out of my office and never returned my supervisor later told me that , as i suspected , i had screwed up royally this memory resonates with dinah 's statement that it 's the recipient 's reaction to a joke or a comment that counts so know thy audience , and know thyself you 're obviously on much safer ground if you make a joke about a community or an ethnic group that you belong to we do , however , live in an era of enhanced sensitivities and political correctness , and need to be extra careful not to anger or offend with respect to the youtube audio , i , like a number of your readers , have heard other versions and have become desensitized to it ironically , i read about a version of it being told by a psychiatrist moonlighting as a standup comic years ago my immediate reaction was , keep your day job , doc ! since psychiatry hotline is available to a large and varied audience , including people suffering from mental illness , i would not personally have posted it although it appears comparatively innocuous , i voted for it as offensive from a psychiatrist 's point of view because it trivializes mental illness and is potentially hurtful to many warmest regards , edward w darell , m d blog shrinquerap on wordpad very soon to be updated please do not sue me i registered the domain name before hearing of your blog , and my pockets are extremely shallow just short of being inside out url www shrinqerap com and while we 're on the subject of humor a nice break before i start writing about in treatment tonight sarebear sent us a link on a proposal to classify happiness as a psychiatric disorder hmmm it 's a joke , right ? and do n't worry , dr darell , we 're not going to sue you , but do keep your day job
