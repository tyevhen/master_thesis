when someone s entire being is permeated with the sense that no one wants me , to the degree that he needs drugs to kill the pain , this is not just an idea we have to change it is an organic part of that person ideas are not something we produce willy nilly we don t just have differences in opinion we have differences in total personality , which gives rise to opinions likewise , when a person s default mode is to give up in the face of obstacles , he is responding to the sensation deep in his brain of what s the use of trying because it lies so deep , it has a profound impact the words to describe his state are a late evolutionary development they are not to be confused with the biologic state the physiology of defeat in the hierarchy of valence or strength , words are the weakest when compared to the force of these first line non verbal imprints we must not believe that if we treat the patient with words , changing the labels , we can make a profound difference we can plaster on new false ideas to old feelings , but the feeling changes not at all all that happens in this case is that the further suppression of the real feeling creates more stress on the system imprints are not conquerable nor to be convinced we may be able to convince someone out of her ideas , but never out of her physiology our job is to align the ideas with the feeling i should say it is the patient s job because her feelings when felt will do it all by itself no patient sitting up in a chair in a comfortable office can feel the kind of terror he can only feel in a darkened , padded room yet this sitting up framework prevents the cognitive therapists from taking patients back in history first , their theory does not account for it , and secondly , the very office set up prevents it the organization of an office follows from the theory it is all designed to keep the focus in the present often on the words of the therapist sadly , one of the greatest dangers we face is from our past and ourselves , a memory informing us that we are not loved by our parents , that we never will be , and that all is hopeless this forces us into all sorts of behaviors to avoid feeling hopeless the problems we have may be between people , but the solution is within the closer one is to oneself , the closer one can be to others
