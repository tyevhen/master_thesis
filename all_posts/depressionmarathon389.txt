i'm still settling back into my home after the long weekend away with d it was a good weekend , but it was also an interesting weekend acutally , i'm still digesting and sorting through what we did and how i felt lessons , i believe , are in the details if i choose to be open to them in direct contrast to the last weekend we spent together , when d and i seemed to be perfectly in sync , enjoyed each other immensely , and shared every moment this past weekend we seemed to be perfectly out of sync we spent fewer moments enjoying each other and a bunch of moments on each other 's nerves we shared space but not necessarily time we moved about in parallel planes rather than intersecting ones it was much different than my last experience with d different does n't make it good or bad it was what it was i know relationships require work and are not all fun all the time , so i'm not freaking out about this i'm just noting it , replaying a few moments , and trying to learn what i can my primary lesson , i think , is to speak up when i need to speak up i cannot let fear be my guide there were a few instances this past weekend , after moments of tension , when i had the opportunity to express my feelings but did n't that likely only made things worse i pride myself on communicating well , but i did n't take the opportunities presented to me this weekend in general neither of us communicated well we were equally prickly i ca n't control d 's actions , but i need to be vigilant in the future and speak up keeping my feelings inside will do nothing to expand our relationship it will only breed resentment resentment has no place in any of my relationships , especially this one i will work harder to communicate better in the future this relationship is important to me i am a little shaken by the mood of this past weekend , but i think we are okay my feelings for d certainly have n't changed we 'll talk soon i 'll say what i need to say , and hopefully we 'll continue moving forward it was n't fun being out of sync with each other , but i'm taking from the experience what i can sometimes i wish lessons were n't so necessary or so challenging , but i guess god thought i could handle this one i 'll do my best to live up to the expectation
