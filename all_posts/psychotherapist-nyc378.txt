accident or other emotionally overwhelming events , can develop ptsd we often associate ptsd with soldiers in war originally , ptsd during combat was called shell shock however , we now know that ptsd can develop outside of combat situations people who develop ptsd might not experience any symptoms for months or even years after the event anything that reminds them of the traumatic event might cause them to feel like they 're reliving the original traumatic event they might feel panic or intense fear whenever they are confronted with reminders for instance , if someone gets into a severe car accident , after he recovers from the accident , he might be too afraid to drive again or , even if he is able to get behind the wheel again , he might experience feelings of terror and dread if he has to drive to the same place where the accident occurred without help , ptsd can be a severe and debilitating disorder that can seriously affect a person 's life as he or she relives the incident emotionally and tries to avoid anything that brings up these feelings again getting help for anxiety disorders anxiety disorders are not the same as normal stress and every day anxiety left untreated
