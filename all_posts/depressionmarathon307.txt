it was a few nights ago i was speaking for the local chapter of the national alliance on mental illness nami as many of you know , i do this occasionally i tell my story i retrace my journey with depression to diverse groups of people , from junior high school classes , to church organizations , to mental health providers , and in the process attempt to break down some of the stigma surrounding mental illness it 's almost always a rewarding , uplifting experience i get as much or more positive vibes from telling my story as others do from hearing it i enjoy doing it speaking to interested groups almost always makes me feel a belly full of gratitude this was especially true the other night , as one of the audience members was a retired psychiatric nurse with whom i had many interactions over the years she commented that it was nice to see me she was enjoying seeing me there , recovered what i wanted to tell her was it was just as nice for me to see her it was great to be seen in recovery mode rather than while in the throes of my illness , which is , of course , when she had seen me in the past does that make sense ? and seeing her filled me with gratitude for all of the mental health providers i 've seen over the past years there are so many providers who 've made a major impact on me , yet they 'll never know driving home , i had the urge to stand on a roof top and yell , thank you , at the top of my lungs ! i wanted to invite those with whom i 'd connected to my home to see me , as i am today , living well i wanted to show them their work with me made a difference it mattered and i had n't forgotten it 's too bad most providers with whom i 've connected will never know where i ended up they have no idea what happens to most of their patients it 's only through chance meetings like the one i just had that we get to show off our healthy selves and say thanks so that 's what i did i said thanks , to those i could , that very night i sent out some gratitude e mails and i plan to say thank you , out loud , to those i can the next time i see them my doctor , therapist , social worker they 've all heard it before , but i do n't think i can thank them enough i would n't be alive today without them i also would n't be alive today without the nurses at generose w , mayo clinic , so this post will have to suffice unfortunately , most will never see it and those nurses are the ones i 'd especially like to invite over , to show off how well i am today , as a direct result of the care they gave me those nurses saw me at my most ill , and they cared for me when i could not care for myself , with respect , compassion , and love i am lucky to have had access to them and to their inpatient unit i am a lucky woman today i feel well and i feel grateful for feeling well i did n't get here by myself i 've had lots of help it 's important for me to remember that it takes a village i'm so thankful for all of my fellow villagers
