personality disorders are a difficult topic for me for one thing , they are highly stigmatized and i think the term personality disorder encourages that stigma by suggesting that there is something terribly wrong with a person 's identity , rather than implying that people with these disorders respond to the world in a highly ineffective manner that creates problems for themselves and others in fact , butcher describes personality disorder in his textbook abnormal psychology as characterized by chronic interpersonal difficulties and problems with one 's identity or sense of self this description is good as long as we accept that the problem with one 's identity is that one 's self esteem and view of one 's relationships with others is unstable everybody exhibits some dysfunctional beliefs and behaviors , but they should not be diagnosed with a personality disorder unless the behavior is pervasive and inflexible , and causes clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning people with personality disorders generally cause just as many problems for others as they do in their own lives most do not recognize the dysfunction in their own thoughts or behaviors therefore , it is often friends , family , or the law that force people with personality disorders to seek treatment personality disorders are grouped into three clusters cluster a includes paranoid , schizoid , and schizotypal personality disorders people with cluster a disorders tend to be suspicious , paranoid , and or withdrawn cluster b includes histrionic , narcissistic , antisocial , and borderline personality disorders people with these disorders have a tendency towards drama , emotionality , and erratic behavior cluster c includes avoidant , dependent , and obsessive compulsive personality disorders these people tend to experience anxiety and fear most personality disorders are not caused by a few traumatic events , but by a build up of many stressors throughout life like childhood abuse , neglect , or criminal behavior in parents a child 's natural temperament may also have a strong impact on the development of a personality disorder later in life compared to the other mental illnesses , there is little research on personality disorders this is because people with personality disorders often do not feel there is anything wrong with themselves , or if they realize there is something wrong , they have less than helpful personality characteristics such as lack of empathy or withdrawn social interaction another difficulty in studying people with personality disorders is the large amount of misdiagnosing that occurs the criteria for diagnosis are more influenced by a clinician 's judgement than are the criteria for other mental illnesses due to these difficulties in diagnosis of personality disorders , much work has been done in developing dimensional systems as an alternative to the cluster model a dimensional model would rate a person on a set of personality traits , thus providing an overall behavioral pattern such an analysis would theoretically be more empirical than the cluster model such changes were proposed for the dsm , but they were deemed too complex for rushed clinicians and were shunted off into the emerging measures and models section one popular dimensional approach is the five factor model according to proponents of the big five , everyone 's personalities can be defined by our strengths and weaknesses in five traits neuroticism , openness to experience , extraversion , agreeableness , and conscientiousness each of these traits are further separated into sub traits neuroticism anxiety , anger hostility , depression , self consciousness , impulsiveness , and vulnerability extraversion warmth , assertiveness , gregariousness , activity , excitement seeking , and positive emotions openness to experience fantasy , aesthetics , feelings , actions , ideas , and values agreeableness trust , straightforwardness , altruism , compliance , modesty , and tender mindedness conscientiousness competence , order , dutifulness , achievement striving , self discipline , and deliberation using this model , when a patient comes in for analysis , she would be rated high or low for each of the factors the overall pattern combined with knowledge of whether the individual experiences clinically significant distress can be used to diagnose a personality disorder using the five factor model , only six of the personality disorders would remain borderline , antisocial , schizotypal , narcissistic , obsessive compulsive , and avoidant the others paranoid , schizoid , histrionic , and dependent personality disorders would be dropped hopefully much research will go into developing a more empirical approach to diagnosis of personality disorders , for i feel that patients would benefit greatly from treatments that target specific dysfunctional traits instead of a generalized personality disorder if you 're interested , there are quite a few big five tests on the internet i just took the truity test if you take it , you do n't have to create an account there 's a skip option my scores were open to experience conscientiousness extraversion agreeableness neuroticism apparently , a score of is considered average person this test was fun and gives you an idea of what types of questions might be asked with a dimensional approach to diagnosis however , it was certainly too short and silly to accurately diagnose a personality disorder i'm surprised i did n't get a higher score on neuroticism because of my bipolar disorder hopefully the test developed by clinical psychologists is much more extensive and precise this is a series of posts summarizing what i'm
