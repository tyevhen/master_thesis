changing leaves rich reds , oranges , and browns dying echinacea and me being my usual hippie child self and hiding behind said echinacea buying five , count 'em , five , bags of apples from our local orchard we estimate it to be nearly pounds of apples ! also picking our own apples ! they 're a special type , red skin , and deep pink flesh ! they 're a bit scabby and misshapen , but they 're simply wonderful for baking they 're pleasantly tart , have a gorgeous colour , and a wonderful texture when cooked so , of course , we cooked several delicious apple crisps , using both our own apples and the ones from the orchard one day when my mom was out , i decided i wanted to make an apple crisp , despite the fact i never bake so usually fail at it when i do attempt to do baking related things so i dug through a couple dozen cookbooks my mom has quite an impressive cookbook collection until i found a recipe for apple crisp , then i proceeded to make one , mostly following the directions i was rather surprised when it turned out great ! and disappeared quickly peace , idzie
