my mom is back in town she and my step dad are full time rv'ers counting a couple months last summer , this is only the second time since i was we 've been in the same zip code it 's strange we get along better now than we ever have , but that still is n't all that great sometimes but it is nice to have her nearby it 's strange to have her nearby , yet it 's nice for one thing , she 's a waaaay better cook than i am of course , that 's not difficult anyone who actually cooks is a better cook than i am ! i do like to drop by right around dinner time my step dad is cool , too he and i have a lot in common we share the depression diagnosis , so sometimes he gets what i'm saying more clearly than my mom that 's helpful i do n't really know what i'm trying to say here maybe i'm just figuring out out loud how to live so close to my mom for example , i want to invite her to things i'm doing , like races , art shows , and softball games then , just when i'm ready to invite her , i change my mind , or i feel less certain about wanting her there it 's weird i guess that 's one to present to my psychologist , huh ? so my mom is on the way over here we 're going to eat dinner and i do n't know why i just wrote all this i guess i 'll have to figure that out with my therapist , too have a lovely evening
