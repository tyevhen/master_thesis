as i was attempting to cruise through my mile tempo run last night , i had only thoughts of boston in my head boston a wonderful city in which i lived and ran the city , really , where my running career began once my years as a team sport athlete ended after college this morning , i watched online as of the fastest women in the united states ran loops of the same roads and trails on which i used to daily hoof , as they attempted to qualify for the olympics in beijing ironic , as i look at the map of their course the same exact paths along the charles river , through back bay , and around the commons i wish i were there to share the energy of the day but it was the boston marathon , taking place tomorrow , which was especially on my mind last night i will be cheering from afar as friends , local runners , toe the historic hopkington starting line with , others around am tomorrow patriots day it is a massachusetts holiday filled with reenactments of paul revere 's ride and the first battles of the american revolutionary war , but it is better known to us runners as boston marathon day during my years as a local , i wanted to participate in the historical events of the day , but watching the marathon always won out several times , i even ran sections of the course , as i helped pace friends in their efforts to re qualify for the next year 's race once i even accidentally crossed the finish line a big no no for an unregistered runner in boston ! i was lucky to get away without being shot ! what fun ! now i live far away again , and i realize i may have taken all of those opportunities for granted i have never towed the line in hopkington myself and therein lies my sadness today i planned hoped to be in boston this weekend both to spectate and run over the past year , i was vocal in my encouragement of others within our community let 's make it a party in boston , i said ! we 'll all qualify and go together ! it will be great ! obviously , the rest of the story is by now quite clear of the many who did qualify and decided to go , i was not among them ironic , huh ? i am sad that i will not be there to celebrate with all of them , and experience a first boston with so many of them you see , boston is the ultimate goal for those of us competitive runner types who will never have a shot in hell of qualifying for the olympics why ? because of that one little word qualify you must run a qualifying time to run boston they do n't let any ol' shmo on their course ! for us mere mortals , running boston is often the ultimate , life long goal boston is special boston marathon weekend has been tough for me since , the first year i had the opportunity to officially run boston and did n't i qualified at the twin cities marathon in september , but by spring , running was fighting a losing battle with my depression no worries , i thought , i 'll just run it next year while my qualification was still valid for , my body was even less inclined to travel miles on foot i have not run a qualifying marathon time since i have n't run close to a qualifying marathon time since so boston marathon weekend continues to be bittersweet as i remember it today , it was depression that kept me from training , and therefore kept me from meeting that life long goal but i wonder depression was ever present and grueling , yes but , was i also taking for granted that i would be able to qualify again ? if i had known then how significantly my running ability , motivation , and desire would drop off after , would i have pushed myself just a bit harder ? would i have gone and run anyway , despite not being in perfect shape ? i think i might have , but then hindsight is , is n't it ? fortunately , hindsight and disappointment found a willing student in me from them , i learned the concept of living in the moment given the same opportunity today , i might delegate my energy resources differently or make different decisions today , i know i need to strangle the moment i am in , for i will not have that moment again missing boston , twice , likely hammered that lesson home so today i will live in today , and i encourage you to do the same do n't take your boston for granted live now grab now do it now tomorrow , especially when living with a chronic , debilitating illness , is never guaranteed
