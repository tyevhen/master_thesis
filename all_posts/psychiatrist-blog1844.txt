posted by dinah this is the thing , while blogging is no longer ruining my life , and shrink rap is simply a blog , it continues to bring me satisfaction i like having somewhere to come when something stirs me up i like having an outlet to write i 've said this before , but hey , repetition is part of the deal in psychotherapy , and while writing blog posts is n't psychotherapy it is therapeutic one should take satisfaction and joy where one can find it , even if that means eating chocolate with friends while you talk about things you know nothing about , into some strange looking microphone that looks like something out of a sci fi movie and then you take pictures of your feet this is the other thing , i do n't try to find topics to write about , i wait until i get hit by a wave of inspiration the funny thing is , i seem to get hit by these inspiring waves at moments when i'm not near a computer i 'll get an idea then i 'll get another idea then i 'll get a third idea then when i'm near a computer , and either i ca n't get into the dashboard help , it 's demanding i update to new blogger roy says not yet , and then he vanished under the floorboards or my ideas have vanished so , i'm pleased i could get into the dashboard today i'm sure what i wanted to say i keep meaning to write about the importance of the relationship in psychotherapy , though i'm not sure what it is , exactly , that i want to say that , you may have noticed , has never stopped me before we 're waiting on roy for a blogger post on why we love psychiatry i even linked it to a cute little poem roy has n't finished yet , and i imagine he 'll let me know when he has i 've thought of asking if anyone one out there , say all those editors at doubleday , wants to publish my latest novel ? i'm a bit lost , though it 's been mailed off to new york i 've been at it too long to let myself feel hopeful if you do n't hear from us for a while , it 's because i ca n't get in to post i'm not sure how it happened today , yesterday i could n't get access at all oh , and it did n't help that clinkshrink had comcast problems really just rambling thank you for listening
