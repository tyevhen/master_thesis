only did he miss his parents , but he also felt like a young , vulnerable child again who was unprotected in a potentially dangerous world the reality was that ted was functioning much better on a day to day level compared to how he was doing before he went to therapy but his inner emotional experience was that he felt so young , lonely and vulnerable as if he would n't survive without his parents his therapist helped ted to understand that he was going through a normal stage of grieving that most people experience after their second parent dies ted spent many sessions talking to his therapist about feeling lost and dreams that he had about being young and being with his parents he suddenly realized that now that both of his parents were dead , they had taken a part of him with them with his parents and aunts and uncles gone , there was now no one who knew him as a young child his sister , who was years younger than ted , remembered certain aspects of his adolescence and they could talk about their parents , but ted felt the loss of those early childhood experiences with his parents ted also began thinking more about his own mortality , which he used to avoid doing in the past he kept thinking , now that my parents are gone , i'm next he realized how precious time is , and he felt like he was wasting time in a job that he hated more than ever , he felt the need to be doing

meaning in your life to deal with his grief , ted went to the cemetery once a week to visit his parents' grave at first , he felt awkward about what to do but as time went on , as he stood by the

he continued to talk to his therapist about his experiences with grief , ted began to realize that his relationships with his parents did n't end after their death by remembering them , talking about them and having these conversations at the grave site , he was continuing to develop his inner experience of his relationship with his parents as time went on , ted developed a different perspective about each of his parents he could now understand how they felt about the deaths of their parents and the sacrifices they made to maintain a good life for him and his sister even when they were grieving he knew that his friends meant well , but some of them were n't very tactful telling him things like he should n't feel as bad because his parents were both in their s when they died see my article expressing condolences in a caring and tactful manner ted knew that they did n't understand because they had n't experienced the loss of both of their parents yet other friends , who had n't lost either parent yet , seemed to be avoiding ted , as if they were trying to avoid thinking about the eventual deaths of their own parents and their own death so , having a time and place in therapy was very helpful to ted , especially his friends and family members stopped calling him as much to find out how he was doing ted also found it very helpful to write about his feelings in a journal see my article writing to cope with grief and the benefits of writing between therapy sessions grief the emotional impact of losing both of your parents a year later , ted was working at a job that he really loved he was also dating a new woman and their relationship was getting serious although the emotional pain was n't as acute as it had been after his parents died , ted still thought about them every day and wondered what they would think as he was making changes in his life his weekly ritual of visiting his parents grave site and seeing his therapist continued to soothe him , as he went through his grieving process conclusion many people experience the loss of their last parent as a loss of a part of themselves it often comes as a surprise that they feel as if they have been orphaned and a younger part of themselves feels more vulnerable they develop a different perspective of their lives , realizing that life is finite this can lead to making major changes in life to live a happier life people who have n't experienced the loss of the last parent often do n't understand what it 's like although they might be well meaning , their lack of understanding often causes them to say tactless things or to avoid contact it 's also not unusual for marriages that are already struggling to fall apart during this time as the emotional impact of grieving puts extra stress on a
