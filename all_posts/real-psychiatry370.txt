i always hear about expensive medications and what a racket that is for big pharma a recent exacerbation of asthma was an eye opener for me i have had to discard a lot of medications prescribed for me in the past because they either were not indicated like an antibiotic for cellulitis when i really had gout or medications that i thought were too risky they shall remain nameless i posted some of my experiences with medications taken for asthma over a two month period i took oral prednisone in addition to corticosteroid inhalers and beta agonist bronchodilators all of the medication was only moderately effective over a two month period and this necessitated switching between different preparations it also involved discarding some after only one or two doses due to intolerable side effects that trial and error came an a high cost like most employees these days i have a high deductible health insurance plan that deductible is , the final tab between the dates january , and february , was , out of pocket so i guess the good news is that i met my deductible for this year the drug costs are instructive some of the inhalers retail for apiece the out of pocket costs for a high deductible insurance plan varies from to the total out of pocket drug cost for one month of treatment for asthma was , the most important part was that about half of that cost was for medications that could not be tolerated or were ineffective and had to be discontinued this is a form of cost shifting that nobody ever talks about i have over worth of medication sitting on the shelf and ready to be discarded because it was ineffective or could not be tolerated when i think about how many times i have prescribed a medication for a patient only to have the pbm fax me to say that they would only fill days worth of the medication , i wonder about how many tens of thousands of these prescriptions are sitting out there unused what about really expensive medications ? some of those are about the equivalent in cost to a new car or several new cars to give two examples of medications i recently learned about consider olysio simeprevir and sovaldi sofosbuvir new drugs for hepatitis c sofosbuvir costs for a mg tablet or a full course of therapy for , , simeprevir is for a single mg capsule i have already read the cost benefit analyses of theses medications and like most analyses of very expensive medications they seem justified what happens when you take a very expensive agent like this and it is ineffective or you ca n't tolerate the side effects ? medicine may be the only area in american life where the customer underwrites the product cost no matter what what other product works like that ? lemon laws protect car purchases if you buy a new house , as part of that agreement you either sign an arbitration agreement or you are free to sue if something happens to that house most big ticket item retailers have return policies with medications you are often left with an unused bottle staring at you from the medicine chest and reminding you of what it costs it probably takes on a lot more importance now that the average employer plan leads to very high out of pocket costs i do n't mean to imply that any of these products are ineffective my thoughts on what the fda does in terms of drug approval are recorded here in this blog this all has to do with biological variability and balancing type i versus type ii error some of the medications i could not tolerate work exceedingly well for other people some of the medications i take are toxic to others there are no medications that work well with minimal side effects across the entire population is there a solution to this problem ? i think there is a very straightforward one give the pharmacist the option of supplying a smaller portion of the prescription for the patient to test for example , a week of pills or an inhaler with a week of inhalations that would have saved me nearly in unnecessary costs the environmental costs are also unknown there has only been recent interest in what happens to discarded pharmaceuticals when they enter our waste disposal systems and waterways that cost is currently unknown but needs to be considered this post also highlights the difference between biological products like prescriptions and non biological products like cars if a car is a lemon , that is independent of the biology of the owner whether a prescription drug is a lemon or not is solely determined by biology as the cost of health care is shifted back to the consumer , the financing needs to be like any other expensive consumer good that would include some safeguard of value for the money george dawson , md , dfapa
