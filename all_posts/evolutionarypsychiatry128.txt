okay , not likely but the sugary variety might well be causing depression in those vulnerable to fructose malabsorption have a look at my previous post on the subject today i have a mere observational study that adds to a pile of evidence that soda ai n't the best thing in the world to be drinking , behaviorally speaking the twinkie defense the relationship between carbonated non diet soft drinks and violence perpetration among boston high school students here 's an appropriate song right click in new tab to open kiss with a fist some bad news about behavior and soda , associatively speaking in norwegian adolescents , soda consumption correlated with poor mental health among american college students , those who drank more soda were less likely to be social , less able to understand emotional cues , and more likely to favor individualism is that bad ? there are several reasons soda might cause problems the sugar could lead to a low blood sugar crash which is associated with violence as i discussed in this post in addition , soda is a pretty poor source of nutrition other than straight up calories , so if it replaces more nutritious food in the diet , big soda drinkers could end up with micronutrient deficiencies and yeah , micronutrient deficiencies could lead to more violence no one measured if anyone was a fructose malabsorber the experimental design of the boston study was pretty simple boston public high school students were randomly selected and asked to answer a survey those who answered that they drank five or more cans of non diet soda every week comprised of the sample they controlled for a bunch of covariates but i can think of several million more alcohol , age , gender , race , sleep , smoking , family dinners heavy soda drinkers had similar bmis to less heavy soda drinkers , and were no more likely to have less than hours sleep white , black , and hispanic kids are all equally likely to be heavy soda drinkers , but asians were significantly less likely to be quaffing or more cans a week heavy soda users were far more likely to smoke or drink alcohol , and were far more likely to carry around a knife , have been violent with a sibling , a date , or another young person when the sample was split into quartiles rather than two , the violence link remained linear , suggesting a dose response relationship and that 's pretty much it a rather limited self report study with some statistical crunching , no causal relationship can be inferred though there are some sensible physiologic explanations as to why soda could make you knife your sister , it is n't proven here brain eating was not examined more posts this week ! i need to answer js regarding the whole linear glucose thing , and i figured it would warrant a short post rather than a comment jamie has sent me a few papers , and i pulled some reviews on inflammation , atopy , and behavior
