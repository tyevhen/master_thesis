work was good again today , i spent a lot of time preparing for my trip to the us the office was very quiet as a lot of people work from home on fridays plus a few have taken holiday as many of us are flying to the us on sunday i ate my lunch in the orchard again today , it is really pleasant sitting there in the sun someone from my office came to join me so i did not feel quite so much like a loner ! it was someone who does the same job as i do but i have not talked to him much as we work in different teams i have a lot to do tonight and tomorrow , although i have all my work stuff ready to go on sunday i have not started to get my clothes ready and i do not have a suitcase most of them are in the dirty washing and the rest are in the ironing heap i have arranged to meet someone i met on a dating website for lunch tomorrow , i stood him up last time as i got really nervous and freaked out he came quite a long way to see me and he is coming a long way again tomorrow i can not stand him up again i hope i do not get too nervous not sure why he would still want to meet me ? i have been chatting to him for a while now and i have not managed to put him off ? i have loads to do so i need to get on ! i will post again tomorrow evening
