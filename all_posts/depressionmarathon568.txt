it 's tempting to say , why me ? it 's tempting my knee is keeping me off the road the speed workout went undone on tuesday the seven miler did not get run on thursday and the miler , crucial training for an upcoming boston marathon , will not even get started tomorrow i am so discouraged it would be easy to inquire , why me ? i 've certainly been through a lot lately from november through early february , i was barely myself depression enveloped me like a dark , leaden cloak i could barely function hospitalization , ect , financial stress , and a break up i figured that was enough but god had other plans , i guess other plans he had for me much of the time , but not always , i believe things happen for a reason sometimes i have faith god only gives us what we can handle regardless of what i believe , however , i'm here , in this situation , right now it is what it is it 's tempting to ponder , why me ? but what would that accomplish ? i ca n't waste any energy feeling sorry for myself i'm worried i'm worried about my knee i'm worried about my mood i'm worried about my mood because of my knee my track record when i 've been injured and unable to run is not the best but more concerning than my past record is how i'm feeling in this moment my mood has definitely dropped a notch since monday 's injury that concerns me i 'd be lying if i said i was n't frightened if i did n't admit i'm waiting for the other shoe to drop i am concerned i know life is not always easy and that 's certainly true right now i'm being challenged i'm being challenged big time ! it 's simple to wonder why but that only avoids the challenge and leaves me stagnant i cannot wallow wallowing is useless i do not have the luxury of self pity i have to face the fear i have to fight
