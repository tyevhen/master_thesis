primal therapy involves a careful procedure paced by the patient toward bringing sensations and feelings from trauma in one 's early history safely into a conscious experience the apex of this procedure is total reliving of a traumatic experience primal therapy avoids distracting or interrupting the patient in this process we seek to draw attention to sensations and feelings , and allow the patient , when he and his body is ready , to go into the pain , and fully relive it this time , in contrast to the time of the original trauma , the patient can finally experience the feelings , and finally be relieved of their neurotogenic energy the reliving that occurs in primal therapy may be hard to imagine by those who have not seen it in reliving incest , for example , not only are the vital signs exceptionally high , often into near lethal levels , but the physical posture reflects what happened in the original event , the wrists bound together behind the back , for example why , one would question , do we allow these dangerous levels to exist in therapy ? the patient , on the lip of feeling a great trauma , runs a fever one hundred three degrees is not unusual we don t desire it except that without it there is no healing secondly , these elevated levels were the reason for the repression , in the first place sustained blood pressure in hypertensive regions would have killed the newborn what the neuroinhibitors such as serotonin endorphin do is keep reactivity within survival bounds and thereby save one s life a key function of repression now as an adult the individual is stronger , and may begin to relive the trauma , if only in small titrated doses post session vital signs indicate some degree of integration and resolution after a reliving episode known as a primal they usually drop below baseline after the session if they move either up or down sporadically we are dealing with abreaction the discharge of the energy of a trauma without proper connection this is never curative reliving yields insights and cognitive changes automatically reliving never being touched as a child makes immediately clear the reason for one s nymphomania it puts the need for touch in the past so that it is no longer acted out in the present the patient does not need to be told how to appreciate the trauma everything is understood within the feeling , provided it is a full reliving discussing the past trauma is , by and large , a cortical operation that remains in the area of thought it is the inordinate pain portion that is stored in the brain 's limbic system and brainstem that is the culprit to be relived and that is what constitutes the unconscious it is that portion of pain that must be relived if one could see the amount of pain engendered in a primal she would understand right away how important reliving is to the therapeutic process primal therapy differs from most other therapies extant in approach of reliving past traumas rather than discussing them the patient seems to be in the grip of an ancient brain during the reliving which results in an integration of the feeling in the reliving , the whole system will be engaged as it was when the memory was registered this is why in our research we found an average point drop in systolic readings in our high blood pressure hypertensive patients after six months of therapy it is why in a parasympathetic dominant patient often , a depressive who enters a session with a radically lowered body temperature , we will see rises of two or three degrees after the session , as feelings normalize the system normalizing blood pressure is very important if we want to avoid cerebral strokes later on we can normalize with medication but the force is still inside doing its damage elsewhere there is a major difference between normalizing the symptom and normalizing the system the latter has great import for longevity if we normalize one aspect of the system , the rest of the body must compensate , and that is the danger with medication it achieves apparent results , but not profound effects so long as the generating source of the problem stays active it is forever a threat a stroke is not the least of the consequences again , if we try to cure high blood pressure with pills we are depriving the patient of one aspect of the memory and she needs the totality of response to the memory in order to fully relive and get better that is , if we suppress part of the memory there can never be a full reliving because the whole memory is not completed why we must relive as a total experience a reliving of preverbal imprints will evoke the exact same reactions as at the time of the original trauma in the absence of a reliving , the reactions or fragments of the memory will persist , such as a fast heart rate or high blood pressure when we relive a complete early birth memory of which a high blood pressure was a part , then in the total reliving , that fragment of the memory will also be included , and the patient should consequently see relief from the intrusive symptoms if aspects of the original reaction are missing the reliving is not complete and therefore not curative when patients relive enough of their painful history , they no longer need alcohol , drugs , cigarettes , or painkillers less pain , less pain killers when a patient relives early terror , then ceases to compulsively check the locks on his doors twenty times a day , he has solved a key mystery this , without any prolonged discussion of the obsession he felt unsafe , profoundly unsafe early on the obsessions controlled the terror that he didn t even know he had the left frontal cortex was saying , i d better check the locks it makes me feel more comfortable since the terror is there he never can feel safe for long , the obsessions go on the feeling of being unsafe was seeping up in small increments from the right brain it was immediately staved off by the obsession on the left i ll be safe if the house is locked if we were to prevent the obsession we would see terror , which is what we do in our therapy but it must be done in a safe , controlled atmosphere in order to feel deeply unsafe one has to feel totally safe in the present that safety , dialectically , turns into its opposite reliving means to be in the grip of the child s or infant s brain it is different from discussing childhood pain with the adult brain it means to be immersed totally in an old traumatic memory it also involves connection of lower forces to top level brain tissue , as well as right brain feeling information to the left prefrontal cortex there should be brain changes as a result of connection , which is what we want to discover
