my blog is flagging i notice i have n't posted since june my readership is naturally sagging faster than a woman who nursed quintuplets what have i to report ? or what to report have i ? or to report , what have i ? i have what to report ? my strength has never been reporting , and it 's not just the syntax i try to do creative nonfiction as it 's being called today nothing new just another category for mark twain 's the jumping frog of calaveras county , if i remember the title properly , though jumping seemeth redundant but i can report my lovely yr old daughter just concluded a two weeks' visit which made for a pause in our lives , what with all the hiking , shopping , and catching up on her life and ours also , the relative contentment i 've experienced chemically over the last several months has given me no urgent condition to confess i was at the kate wolf musical festival on sunday , mainly to see richard thompson who played solo and did not disappoint though he left the headliner , emmylou harris , in dire straits by playing first people started leaving during her set , and no wonder that breathy , whining voice playing so many slow , essentially three chord songs made for a painful anticlimax some earlier acts were good , notably po girl and the girlie boys the latter group had some amazing harmonies on the literary front i ca n't remember how many links i 've given you to reviews , interviews and the like the reviews of my book are available at my website i 've had the most success in promoting the book at actual readings my next comes on july in la at beyond baroque , a premier venue , so i'm told then i'm reading on july at amnesia bar in san francisco in between we hope to go on a journey north to eugene , oregon and the olympic peninsula to see friends , and old friend from high school and a longstanding literary acquaintance in the peninsula , laird barron , whose new collection of horror stories , the imago sequence , i highly recommend i'm still recovering from sunday 's music marathon it seems wherever you looked someone was passing a funny cigarette and it was hot by mendocino coast standards , and combined with a healthy dose of beer i found myself immobile for long periods , punctuated by my need to wander through the campsites where i ran into a number of friends from the coast in fact , i met the coast rabbi for the first time , the wife of a friend the synagogue out here is a healthy concern below , as you will see , i completed a long poem on the river of life , which also happens to be the theme adopted for our men 's retreat this year the poem diverges from much contemporary poetry by being parnassian , or seeking the high seriousness that matthew arnold spoke of that is to say , the poem relies more upon knowledge already possessed by the reader rather than any quotidian revelation or experiential epiphany gained it talks about the river of life on two levels , but that is quite straightforward and i wo n't belabor the poem anymore here i put it at the end of the post because i do n't know how many will have the patience to read it , although it goes fairly fast under ten minutes out loud , the best way to read any poem and especially this poem because it relies so much on rhythm for its advancement if you get a poet talking about their art , be prepared to be bored for a while driving home from laytonville at am was a trial , after the long day , and my eyes blurred and watered so bad that i feared i would cease to see highway north of willits has some long ass curves you ca n't really see at night , even with your brights , so i felt properly lost and stayed under mph in the right lane when there was one despite the mph speed limit once i got to the in willits i was better off because of familiarity , despite the two lane endlessly winding road with turns sometimes designated at mph the velocity of modern living is nothing to sneeze at , however , for how many have tweeted me in the interim , how many new literary publications have surfaced on the net , how much facebook news has passed me by also i have been rejected again by poetry , which seems to mark each quarter year passing of my life on to another rejection ! what does rejection mean from the top flight magazines ? presumably that you 're not top flight yet i accept that , though in some individual poems , like boundaries recently named the best poem on the net for one week , i may have risen above the glass ceiling , but that 's just another poem rejected by poetry no , wait i did n't see that specific work in my long line of rejections , but i swear i sent it to them once i'm told jack london had near rejections before he really started rolling , but his literary naturalism was a relief from current fare in his time , and he went on to become the biggest celebrity author in america , in fact , after mark twain , truly defining that role i read twenty of his best stories recently , and his perspective of social darwinism is often punctuated with stories of trust and brotherhood in the face of the wild , so it 's not all survivalist literature in particular i enjoyed his south sea tales most only associate london with the far north , but he spent much time in the tropics as well as i said in my last post , i'm also recovering from the laker 's victory next year looks promising again meantime i'm so bored i'm watching the first season of lost at night , a gift from my middle daughter i ca n't explain why i like the show so much , i suppose it 's the characters , though they do not face survival as london 's characters did , as food and shelter are provided by previous inhabitants of the mysterious island i 've been avidly listening to a new bird call that swirls and rises and echoes itself at the end we think it 's a swainson 's thrush , as thrushes are the most elegant singing birds in this neck of the woods , indeed of north america robert frost has a lovely poem on one , the oven bird , as does hardy in the darkling thrush these birds can actually manufacture two tones at once and harmonize with themselves , something humpback whales cannot do for all their length of song i feel a little stymied at present my long poem was roundly trashed at a poetry workshop site i need a boost of creativity or insight or something to get my muse back at the table perhaps i have insulted her by going my way too much in the poem below the reader must judge , if indeed any reader braves the poem it 's ok to be content , my wife assures me , but what i'm experiencing is sort of a boredom with contentment i need a new challenge i will be teaching a health course at the local community college if things work out , but this may depend upon certain uncertainties with my insurance company that pays the bill for my disability i do n't know if they 'll even let me earn a small income through any constructive means totally disabled means no work of any kind , and by putting limits on what such a person can do , the insurance company makes it an all or nothing proposition i mean , if i do the slightest menial work for wages i might be disqualified from my benefits i'm gathering the courage to write them , my main obstacle before confirming my teaching gig , which i would very much like to perform the teaching gig raises that terrible question will they google me ? and if so , will they find the record of my struggle with manic depression ? no doubt , but i hope all the publications listed first will discourage them from further seeking once you 've gone public there 's not much privacy to protect as i try to live my life transparently , this is no problem , but it could present a problem to future employers my response to that would be to block my blog , where most of my confessional agonies have been posted think when i began this blog on july , , i was embroiled in legal complications in mexico regarding the return of our dog and other possessions that were being ransomed by our former maid overall , mexico was a disaster for us , emotionally , physically and financially it was truly the land of dreams , though in our case , failed dreams if you want to get blotto and hang around with wanna be artists and expats , san miguel is the place for you you can even build a lovely house and get divorced afterwards , as some of our friends did affairs abounded all rules were off kathleen and i survived with our love intact but not much else and by this i do not mean to imply that any unfaithfulness occurred on our part , it did n't it 's just that so many free spirits were pursuing adolescent dreams in their s there so michael jackson 's dead for me it 's sort of like bob hope you mean he was still alive ? i kept waiting for bob hope to die until i convinced myself he had done it quietly then i found out the man presumed dead finally died so it goes ca n't keep up with all the icons , past and present in fact , the second page of our paper from santa rosa is often filled with celebrities whom i do n't know or know of and who are the real celebrities ? did i need to know that one member of the band , men at work , was having as birthday ? that 's stretching celebrity to a fine thinness of irrelevance so much for today 's bloviations here 's the poem i removed it because i thought it of poor quality , apologies kiloneutral , ce
