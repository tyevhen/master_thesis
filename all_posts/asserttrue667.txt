new security settings in greasemonkey not long ago , i upgraded firefox , and in the process of doing so i upgraded to the latest versions of a bunch of firefox extensions including greasemonkey and of course , things started breaking some of my favorite greasemonkey scripts including scripts that i wrote to help me manage my twitter account stopped working after a certain amount of hair pulling and cursing , i managed to find and fix the problem , so i thought inasmuch as this particular script breakage problem is happening to other people as well i would post the cure here back in september , the greasemonkey dudes anthony lieuallen , aaron boodman , johan sundstr m decided to improve security by limiting injection scope what it means is that they decided to disallow scripts that target urls with non http schemes in other words , a script that targets file something no longer works by default in the new greasemonkey , whereas scripts that target http something of course still work the reason non http schemes were disallowed is that people were writing evil scripts that target about cache a special url in firefox that exposes your cached data not good but on the other hand , greasemonkey scripts that target file urls are incredibly useful you can create an html form constituting the ui for an app , stick it on your local disk somewhere , have it trigger a gm script , and that script in turn can do cross site ajax and all manner of lubed simian legerdemain behind the scenes , in service of some kind of business or other logic that would n't be possible any other way it 's truly a wonderful capability the problem is , greasemonkey does n't allow it any more by default but fear not the greasemonkey dudes have included a new config setting that lets you defeat the new security measure what you have to do is hand type about config in the firefox address bar , then search filter on greasemonkey fileisgreaseable note the spelling careful not to type fileisgreasable set the resulting value to true see the screenshot posted above note that there is another new config setting as in the screenshot for enabling the targeting of about urls now if only i could solve this issue for chrome lately i 've been porting certain of my greasemonkey scripts to the google browser , and for the most part that 's been working fine , but i notice chrome does n't honor file target urls even when you set your gm script to a target of all urls if anyone knows a workaround scamper around ? what do you call a workaround for greased monkeys ? , fling me a banana , will you ?
