as you may have read in the 'about me' section , i live daily with health anxiety and unfortunately this is my most severe type of anxiety according to anxiety uk , health anxiety is defined as follows 'those affected by health anxiety have an obsessional preoccupation with the idea or the thought that they are currently or will be experiencing a physical illness ' this means that for many people , they will regularly have the fear that they may have cancer , aids or a brain tumour amongst many other illnesses there is also the tendency that if someone else has an illness , the person may feel they have the same but , people may also be obsessive over being ill or becoming ill with a particular illness , like a stomach bug from having one symptom such as a headache , many will jump to the conclusion that it 's something a lot more serious such as a brain tumour , and in turn this will affect their everyday lives anything from a rash , a bite , a cold and muscle pain can all be taken to severity you will often find many people with health anxiety taking regular trips to the doctors , to make sure they do n't have anything wrong with them , otherwise known as a safety behaviour a personal example was the time when i was getting really bad stomach aches , and was sure that there was something wrong and so i went to the doctors after a few tests , i found out that is was just my anxiety creating the physical symptoms for me , it 's not so much about being obsessed with getting a disease , cancer or a heart attack although i am prone to jumping to conclusions it 's mainly the obsessive and controlling fear of being physically ill in front of people for me , this is mainly being sick or having stomach bug , but it could even be something like a nosebleed i question and analyse how i'm feeling pretty much from the moment i wake to the moment i sleep and this can be hell as not only do you feel ill , but you are in a high state of anxiety many people would say now do n't focus on it and stop focusing on yourself but if you felt ill , you would n't ignore it so for someone who feels ill pretty much all of the time due to anxiety and has fears of illness , it would hard to justify your statement just like if someone has a fear of dogs , and they are constantly worrying that a dog might be near them , you ca n't just ignore it you 're scared it can become a downward spiral for example , every day when i have school , i will wake up feeling ill , which is typical of the flight or fight system however , feeling this way will make me think i am actually ill and have a bug therefore , i will find it very difficult to leave the house especially if i have to get in car or a bus etc because i feel i cannot escape , it becomes a big issue of course , this heightened anxiety will increase the symptoms i 've had this fear for as long as i can remember , but it got really severe back in , when my anxiety began to creep in you can read more about it here i 've had to cope with it for a very long time , and i'm not going to deny it it 's very debilitating for example , struggling with public transport in the fear that i cannot escape incase i am ill not going to school , incase i am really ill not doing driving lessons , incase i cannot leave basically , it hinders anything and everything from going for a walk to giving a presentation i know for some of you reading this it sounds absolutely ridiculous , but think about your worst fear and how debilitating that is the mind is extremely powerful and my phobia works in just the same way as yours recently , however it 's taken a new turn i am avoiding certain foods in the fear that it will make me ill for example , i wo n't eat some meat , i will be obsessive with dates and dairy amongst other things to ensure that i do n't get ill even though i know bugs are all around me , i try to prevent illness in any way i can obviously , not eating certain foods and eating less food is in no way good for my health and i am slowly trying to overcome this area of anxiety i hope this has been helpful to you in some way i know many people will say stop worrying and there is nothing wrong with you , but it 's hard to when it 's a fear do n't forget , talking is the most important bit of advice i can give you do n't bottle your feelings up and certainly seek professional help if you feel you need it best wishes , amy xx
