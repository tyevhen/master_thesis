another perfectly gorgeous day today ! wow , we could n't have asked for much nicer weather in which to race i believe over runners showed up the course was new this year it used to be an out and back course , which included many miles on a foot bruising gravel road yuck ! this year , it wound around the city , hitting some historic neighborhoods and several parks it was lovely a big improvement i improved as well i think i came in a few minutes faster this year than last that was a surprise because this year 's course had a few lengthy hills , and as i mentioned a couple days ago , my legs have been feeling a bit dead so , i'm happy about that , but i'm still not where i want to be i finished in , which was fifth in my very small age division an average of per mile is certainly better than i ran a few weeks ago , but it is not near the 's i put down this spring worse , it is nowhere close to the 's i ran a couple years ago for the same distance ! i am encouraged that my recent times are coming down , but it is hard to figure why i 've had such a dramatic drop off over just a couple years it has to be the weight i 've got to drop the weight only then will i be satisfied that i am just slower period accept it until i can lose these pounds , being slower will be difficult to accept actually , it 's not just being slower , it is the amount of effort i must put out to run these slower times that 's really the issue , i think when i was running faster , sure racing was strenuous , but it was also easier i felt light and free running felt natural it flowed i'm not flowing right now that is what i'm ultimately striving for , i guess light free flowing if i felt like that , it really would n't matter what the clock said at the finish line i would be satisfied overall , it was a good day to be a runner i'm encouraged but hardly satisfied i 've got a lot of work to do , with my eating and on the roads , to get back to flowing and flowing that 's where i want to be
