i 've been thinking a lot about about the answer to one of the questions i gave on the radio free school blogs interview a couple weeks back here 's the question and answer going against the middle class mainstream entrenched believe that to have a successful life you have to get higher ed can you define your idea of what success means ? to me it 's quite simple success to me means nothing more or less than being happy i find it pretty hard to comprehend how everyone can not see this ! nothing really matters if you 're not happy , or working toward finding a place in your life that brings you happiness now , to me , happiness is a big word when i think of happiness , and of living a happy life , so many things come to mind sharing passions , following joy , becoming personally empowered through self and community reliance versus reliance on only authority and experts , helping others become empowered through self and community reliance , being a part of a community photo taken fall but of course , i made the mistake of using such a vague word , one that means many different things to many different people , and which does n't encompass , for most people , all of the things that come to mind when i think of it ! when people read that original answer , from comments i got , i think many people interpreted it as being entirely well , self centered as missing all the bits about simply being a good person to me , all that was packed into the word happy all my dreams and goals and hopes as social creatures , humans generally love being good people i feel great happiness when i know i 've helped someone , or affected their life in a positive way but let me put things in a better way on formspring a site where you can ask and answer questions , where i finally decided to jump on the bandwagon and get my own account , i was asked this question what 's your goal in life ? aside from happiness , what important thing do you want to do before you die ? and i answered i want to be able to look back on my life , and know i did the best i could , by my ethics , beliefs , etc basically , my life goal is to have as positive an impact on the world , and on the people around me , as i can that would make me very happy indeed does that explain things better ? i hope it does i also invite you to check out the other two interviews with grown unschoolers who skipped college that radio free school has done cameron lovejoy is this what i want to be doing the day i die ? eli gerzon i love my life peace , idzie you might also like against the current talk from the toronto unschooling conference grown unschooler anna j cook the experience of unschooling helped me to remain confident in myself life happening making transitions and following passions linkwithin
