an obligatory pre new years eve blog post i feel like i 've spent a lot of time looking back on the past recently , reviewing the significant events of the past year and also realising some details have been lost , perhaps due to repressing certain events so , for anyone that may be interested here is an outline of the peaks and troughs of for me i turned at the beginning of the year i put a lot of effort into a house party at uni , exhausting myself in attempts to ensure everyone else had a good time meanwhile i was having a life crisis , on the verge of a breakdown and was dying my hair pink all photos of this time have been deleted ! after a devastating doctors appointment i had a severe breakdown in february of which i will go into further detail in a future post i 'd been told to keep going with a treatment that had n't been working towards improving my mood i barely contained my anxiety and tears during the short walk from the doctors to my university house as soon as i entered my room i saw how dismal my life had become , i was a recluse , bound to my room , surrounded by cereal bowls and quick snacks to eat to avoid meeting anyone in the kitchen i saw this colossal mess and fell to my knees sobbing , i did n't care who could hear me anymore , it was all too much a slight contrast to the previous month i got engaged who knew an anxious , depressed wreck could sustain a relationship for long enough for someone to realise there was some goodness and hope left in me of course the naughty voices of depression whispered horrible thoughts in my ears , its a pity engagement , he thinks he 'll lose you if he does n't put a ring on it etc the time between april and july has become quite foggy in my mind a lot happened very quickly i had to make some serious decisions that would change the way i 'd been living i battled with the workload of university , i 'd been housebound for months due to overwhelming anxiety so i was attempting to teach myself how to use a statistics programme to complete coursework and trying to stay on top of all of my other work i was essentially attending university without reaping any of the benefits i ended up packing up all of my things and leaving university in june , i had n't seen any of my friends since my birthday and i was terrified that i had lost them because they did n't know what had been going on i had intended on taking my exams in the summer and then taking a year off from studying , putting my final year off as i knew i would n't be able to cope with the normal pressures of the course as well as a dissertation however , as the exam dates approached i realised i was full of anxiety , i could n't sleep and the whole thing was making me physically unwell i made the incredibly hard decision to not go back to university as i need to take some time to improve my physical and mental health none of it was easy to walk away from , there were a lot of sleepless nights and tearful conversations about what i ought to do during this year i 've had a lot of trouble with addressing my mental health issues , i 've seen far too many doctors and psychiatrists that have n't helped me and actually ended up doing more damage to me i 've resolved to carry on taking anti depressants as i know how badly i feel without taking them i 've also realised that writing is a really useful way for me to address my problems , i also write a lot of letters or notes to family and friends when i need to discuss difficult topics , i have trouble articulating my feelings in person and often get cut off by some more dominate personalities overall this year certainly has n't been the greatest , although there have been some sneaky pick me ups along the way sneaky highlights including getting engaged to my best friend and the most perfect person for me i was also taken on an incredible holiday by my fiance 's family , a location that had been thoroughly pinned onto my dream destinations board on pinterest , somewhere i certainly never imagined getting to go to ! the whole trip made me appreciate how lucky i can be , not just to go on such an amazing trip , but also realising how lucky i am to have found such a brilliant extension to my family , i owe so much to them and yet they want nothing in return except for their son 's happiness and a few of my rare smiles i 've also realised how good it feels to have spoken up about my problems , initially i only saw the pain it caused my parents when they realised how long i 'd been hiding it and how bad things had become for me however , since speaking up i 've realised who my true friends are , the ones that have stuck by me throughout and now know me better than ever before this year has shown me that i have made some good positive decisions starting this blog was initially terrifying , but the fear was worthwhile to me when i realised i could help others by sharing my experiences talking about my depression and social anxiety has been a difficult but much needed step to take as a result i have educated a number of my friends and family about what its like to live with these debilitating conditions , and i 've also had a lot of conversations with people whom i never knew had have similar problems we all just need to talk a bit more about the serious things , not only will we become more informed , we will become closer as a result i hope you all enjoy your new years eve celebrations , and hopefully will bring us all some better times
