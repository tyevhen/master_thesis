i'm leaving the hospital today hmmm i bet you 're wondering how i feel about that well , it 's time i could have stayed an extra day , but i think i'm ready to get home and get ready for boston i'm worried , of course , about what my mood and my thinking will become once i'm alone in my living room but bill and cindy , friends extraordinaire , are at the ready with fresh sheets and fluffy pillows if things do n't go well i am so grateful for that i m grateful to be feeling a little better , too my mood has improved over the past two days it 's still not great , but it 's improved i 'll take that i feel a bit more confident going to boston with a better mood i 've got a lot to do over the next day and a half to get ready i think the preparation for boston and the marathon will keep my brain in check over the weekend i'm a little bit worried , however , about what will happen once i'm back what will happen once i'm back ? will the glow of boston keep me elevated for awhile ? will post marathon let down cause me to crash ? will the change in medication kick in and get me back on the right path ? i do n't know nobody knows and i ca n't worry about that especially at this point , i need to take things one day , perhaps even one moment , at a time what will be will be worrying will not change it i'm trying to remember that so wish me luck as i bound out the hospital doors , board my plane , and run boston 's famous mile course i may not have access to a computer out there , so do n't be alarmed if i miss a few days with all of you once again , thank you all for your wisdom and support over these past few weeks how lucky am i to be connected to all of you ? very lucky very lucky , indeed
