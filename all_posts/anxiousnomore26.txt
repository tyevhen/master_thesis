happy to say that my little boy finally came on nov rd he is such a blessing and a little sweetheart meet paxton most of the time i tell myself i am worrying for no reason , and alot of times my fears are very silly and i know it and that is usually the case but i admit i am a big wuss , and i was really concerned about the pain of delivering a baby again so i did everything i could think of to prepare i switched doctors and hospitals to be able to deliver at one that was right down the street i took a tour of the hospital to be more familiar with where i needed to go i spoke with my doctor and the hospital personel about how i deliver very quickly i watched videos about how to breathe during labor and i practiced i wrote out my positive affirmations and packed them in my hospital bag i created a playlist of peaceful songs on my ipod however , it is very unfortunate and sad and scary to say that my worst fears about his delivery ultimately came true and that no matter how much i prepared , my fate was ultimately in the hands of other people for the first two hours of contractions i was really proud of myself i did my breathing exercises and handled the contractions really well i was in good spirits because i figured my epidural would be coming any minute and i could hang on until then to make a really long story short , even though i told the staff i wanted an epidural as soon as possible and that i deliver very quickly , it still took them hrs from the time i asked for it to get it to me and the first epidural only numbed my legs , not the contractions so by the time i got the correct dosage , it was too late i ended up delivering my baby naturally and then had the epidural kick in afterwards not trying to scare any women out there , but it was the most painful experience of my life it was a nightmare come true i still get angry when i think about it the worst part was that i was in so much pain , obviously so , and the nurses were just moseying around like they see it everyday , no big deal , no need to rush to help me out luckily since i deliver quickly the whole torturous event only lasted hours all i can conclude from the experience is that if i ever have another baby , i will learn how to deliver naturally not because i want to , but because its the only way i can be in control if i need to be so after a long break of sleepless nights and lots of baby spit up , i think i am finally ready to take back my life and get things rolling again thanks for all of the well wishes sent my way , i really appreciate them anyone else ever feel like they had to rely on others to help them in a scary situation ? did they come through for you or were you let down ? if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like oh boy or girl ? ! ? why do we shut people out when we need them the most ? big news and lots of anxiety to go with it panic attacks triggered by labor pains linkwithin
