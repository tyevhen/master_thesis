you all know that i have been suffering from depression for a while now in fact , some of you know that i sank pretty darn low at some point the good news is that i am technically better , i am no longer on the brink of death i have to admit that this blog , even though i have been somewhat quiet in the last little while has been partially responsible for my imporving an audience , no matter how small can make a difference , no matter what my occupational therapist was telling me the bad news is that i seem to have plateaued in my recovery furthermore , my symptoms seem to have morphed into a new animal , but still depression on one hand i have become terribly confused and lost it 's like my brain has taken a vacation and forgot to come back this may be a side effect of my medications i cannot focus and concentrate and i struggle to do what used to be so easy and simple on the other hand i have lost interest in so many things former things that brought me joy , even small joy bring me nothing but boredom things like reading playing games online doing crossword puzzles the satisfaction of a clean house or something like it , my house is never clean cooking baking taking a walk drawing crafting taking a drive shopping blogging etc it has all become such a chore , so boring it 's as if i have become massively lazy before you ask , yes sex is on that list , but i gave up on sex years ago anyone have any suggestions or advice on how i can gain pleasure again ? thanks for reading you might also like depression is a choice bipolar nos and new treatement working part time and still exhausted linkwithin
