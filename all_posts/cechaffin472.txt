yes , i'm terrified of this retreat , since my mood has dipped considerably over the last four days , though i have obtained the medication i was missing at some cost while waiting for the mail order medications from god knows where that take god knows why so much time to arrive with their postmarks from cypress or the seychelles in my melancholy i have visions of myself breaking down at the retreat in some happy drum circle and crying uncontrollably then the enlightened will surround me and ask me what 's wrong bad chemicals , i 'll say they 'll ask , what did you take ? no , i mean the bad chemicals my brain makes i'm a manic depressive oh , they 'll say , pitying me without understanding maybe they 'll suggest an archetype to meditate upon , or lead me to the sweat lodge all i know is that i was doing well until tuesday of this week , when i felt sadness over the cost of a lawyer i was not depressed , i was merely sad but being still fragile , i started spiraling downward and now here i am at kilorats , trying not to cry as i write i trust the return of the other antidepressant to my regimen will help , but one can only hope on a positive note , my younger brother has climbed out of his depression with the help of a good psychopharmacologist , and i can only say , it 's about time , good to have you back ! having nothing but time to kill until kathleen gets off work and drives me to the campground , i did some more organization of my poems out of roughly poems i have published and unpublished what worries me in the submission guidelines of the snooty journals , like the antioch review , is that any online publication of poems is considered publication i think this patently unfair , especially in the early days of the litnet when readers were few but as with medical school , the top notch journals are n't looking to accept but reject you they want a few good poems it 's finding the fly in the ointment that they do i know , from eight years of editing , how that goes where am i going with this ? i want my best poems available for publication , so i'm not sure i should even post them on this blog can i have an opinion from a copyright lawyer ? more globally , i feel myself in that stew of hopelessness where i am living the pipe dream life of a writer while guilty of not practicing medicine , like i should be doing i ca n't accept my disabled label it makes me feel so less than yet i know this is my bad chemicals speaking over the weekend kathleen and i had fun fishing and hiking and i felt happy not manic , not in denial , just happy to be i aim to get back there , but this sputtering depression is driving me nuts it seems that just as i start to get my head above water someone or something dunks it down again i ventilate here simply to continue my narrative and share my fear of the new agers , who may prove more scary than the touchy feely presbyterians i encountered earlier i 'll post an unpublished poem below this cannot be considered a publication credit because it is self published in a blog that 's my opinion , anyway at three kilorats , ce too many voices i 've lost my soul some strange imposter puts on airs , practices smiles , greets my mailman i page through obituaries and yearbooks and the diary i never kept but there 's no record of me so i take a hummingbird 's sip of pear blossom nectar , spit it out my nose and laugh the angels particularly the obese ones dedicated to pleasure laugh mostly , it is their job my job is to seek the food of one will , the drink of one thought in my dream i lead the sheep to safety , only to discover at last , the joke they are all wearing my face each time i wake i lose another piece of me out of charity i embrace what 's left there was too much of me , anyway , too many demands and too many voices
