it 's early morning , and i am getting ready for work i work hours today prior to taking off for d 's lake home in wisconsin i ca n't wait to get going although packing is not my favorite thing to do , and doing so kept me up late last night , tired , i am nonetheless ready to go my vehicle is stuffed with dog kennel , dog food , dog beds , dog towels , dog treats , dog toys , dog tie out , and even a doggy life vest i 've got a medium sized suv , and there 's barely a spot left for my suitcase ! i 'll try to post while away unless i totally collapse in the sunshine , i may even share some pictures although i wo n't object if i do collapse under the sun until we meet again , have a great day , friends !
