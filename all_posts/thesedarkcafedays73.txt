like i mentioned in my last post , i 've been going through old stuff i wrote during last year 's darkest days and thought i would share some song lyrics that did n't make it into any song these were inspired by some things i was learning about c s lewis' poetry the planet concept metaphor at the end but mostly they were inspired by my epic fail of a crush a romance that i misread signals for that never got off the ground the guy seemed into me but we could n't date because we were in a group that did n't allow it so he entered a relationship with another chick cue angsty songwriting sessions and months of living in denial , still hoping he will change his mind and obsessing over him even though he treats you like crap even though you 're older and more talented and mature ! go figure i ca n't satisfy you i ca n't keep your attention your eyes shine when you speak of her they wander when you talk with me when will i see i'm a hopeless case just another not pretty enough face why does god give her what i long for your eyes may be open but you 're blind if you 're heart 's closed the truth 's being shouted but you 're not taking notes i'm a discarded image a beautiful star shining in some unseen corner of your sun centered world but beware of the first clarity maybe i 've been letting a grain of the universe be the center of the world set me on fire propel me through the air i 'll let off fireworks i 'll see what 's out there find new planets a place where i can dance i shine bright i deserve a celestial romance r g spring read more about romantic relationships read more poetry read more about loneliness
