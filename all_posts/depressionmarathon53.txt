it 's hard to believe i 've been dealing with this painful back injury for three solid weeks now i'm beginning my fourth week without work tomorrow i 've been humbled by friends and coworkers who have mowed my lawn and arrived at my door with groceries and gift cards for gas i'm so grateful for their generosity i 'll have to use my savings to pay the bills for as long as i can , but not having to worry about gas and groceries makes my life incredibly less stressful at least i can go about my day to day activities without worrying about how much money is in my wallet i'm hoping for a quicker resolution to my back injury after seeing a spine specialist on friday during her exam there was no denying my pain , left leg weakness , loss of sensation , and loss of reflexes she referred me to a surgeon i see him this wednesday surgery is the likely option now , as my symptoms have continued to worsen if the surgeon agrees , i'm going to push for surgery before the end of the week each passing day brings greater and greater apprehension for me i can hardly control the worry thoughts the longer this goes , and the weaker my leg gets , the less likely i am to have a full recovery after surgery a full recovery would mean the return of all of my leg strength at this point it 's possible that wo n't happen , even after they surgically relieve the pressure on my l nerve root if i do n't regain my leg strength , i would either not be able to run as i wish , or not be able to run at all that thought scares me out of my mind if i had the choice i would rather lose my home than lose the ability to run a roof over my head can be replaced the peace , serenity , joy , and drive i get from running ca n't that pretty much says it all i'm scared , really scared , and anxious to get this thing fixed i'm dealing with the pain i'm doing my best to combat the inevitable progression of the weakness and i'm continuing to attend to my responsibilities as well as i can i 'll let you know how it all goes and if you 're into prayers , i'm take them
