it was a three workout day yesterday , and i did it even though i'm still recovering from last week 's illness , i had an unusual amount of energy maybe i'm actually getting in shape ? ? it was a great day i started out with my usual aa meeting before heading off to the gym for a cable class strength workout oh my god , the instructor worked us hard ! it was great ! my muscles were burning from the effort it 's so nice for me to have an instructor tell me what to do i find i work a lot harder than i could ever manage on my own i left the gym around am , treated myself to a caramel latte at mcdonald 's , and went home for lunch after letting my food settle for an hour , i was out the door with puck by for an interval run my boy made it about halfway through the minute run , but at least he did n't end up limping it was a beautiful day i tried to relax through the quick intervals while soaking up the sun during the relaxed running sections the run went well , but i 'd be lying if i said i was n't worrying about the upcoming bike ride my quads were already tired when i mounted my bike at o'clock thankfully , my friend renee agreed to ride with me despite the fact that she 'd already run miles ! she 's nuts and amazing ! i was grateful for the company it 's much easier to push through discomfort , or boredom , when i 've got training partners i confirmed that i'm still really weak going up hills , as renee easily rode away from me on every one regardless , we had a really nice mile , minute , ride after showering , i treated my parents to some good pizza they 're both sick right now , so i spent some time with them before heading back home for bed needless to say , i slept really well i'm really pleased with what i did yesterday , although i'm not breaking my arm patting myself on the back yet today , i 've got a minute run followed by yards of swim intervals my legs are tired , so i think it will be a little tougher than yesterday , but i'm still looking forward to it after all , monday is a rest day ! i do not think there is any other quality so essential to success of any kind as the quality of perseverance it overcomes almost everything , even nature john d rockefeller
