saturday entry i should be working on my second draft , but i am gripped by an epiphany i just had one could say it is even an old epiphany rediscovered with new words i will never like myself this is the epiphany i had i will never like myself not unless i change how i think somehow i have sewn my self esteem into my goal making so that if i fail to meet my goals , i hate myself for the failure if i meet the goals , then the momentary boost in self esteem is erased the moment i select a new goal and there is always a new goal that is why i will never like myself now that i realize what i ve been doing , i can t think of a more wrong headed way to go about developing self esteem when i was younger i liked myself i was pretty awesome if you asked me self esteem at that time wasn t based on accomplishments because i was too young to have any not in my late teens and early twenties instead , my awesomeness was based solely on the caliber of my goals and how good i looked working on them awesome goals meant awesome me then life tossed a rusty oil tanker into my duck pond i became disabled at twenty five and trapped as a full time stay at home dad i was a loser just ask anyone around me once you got past the veneer , there was just me , and what good was i ? friends , bosses , colleagues would all lose faith i even had members in my church telling my wife at the time to divorce me because i was disabled and flawed that was twenty years ago the story never changed loser loser loser what good was a man who didn t earn money ? what good was a man who was mentally impaired ? and i believed it right along with them now that i have taken a few moments and a phone call to a good friend to think about it , and now that i can see my negative behavior from an outside viewpoint , i realize that this is a common problem with a lot of people it s just that adults with adhd tend to internalize the criticism more than their peers consider this take an employee who is courteous , creative , productive , and profitable and give him an adhd fueled problem with punctuality suddenly , he has no value to anybody even now somebody out there reading this was just thinking , but you ve got to be punctual ! i m not arguing that you shouldn t be punctual , but that too often the entire value of a person is dismissed because of one flaw some might say that one flaw could be a deal breaker depending on what the flaw is , but let s just assume for the sake of my epiphany that the flaw is perceived worse than it truly is in my case , i developed the mindset that if i could only achieve goal x , then people would think of me differently i saw the lack of achievement as the flaw that needed to be corrected the problem with that mindset was that i began to believe that if only i achieved goal x , then i would think differently about myself , too i took my self esteem and sewed it into the fabric of the goal i made them inseparable if i missed a goal , i was a failure if a goal needed to be changed because circumstances changed , i couldn t adapt because my self esteem depended on completing the goal as it stood if i finished the goal , then i was only as good as my next goal no wonder i had such lousy self esteem i had weaponized goal making and turned it on myself so how do i break this mindset ? this is at least a thirty year habit developed in high school and nurtured throughout my adult life the friend who i called suggested i needed a seam ripper to separate my self esteem from the goals based on the name , that sounds violent and destructive , but seam rippers are subtle devices used with surgical precision she suggested that i think of one thing a day that i liked about myself this was a perfect solution i learned to manage my depression by first forcing myself to be thankful of one thing every day no matter how i felt that was difficult , but soon became easier after a while i could list a handful of things i was thankful for with great ease i had trained myself out of the depressive s pessimism into something far more constructive positive thinking empowered me , not because i wore rose colored glasses but because i made it a daily habit my friend actually listed my goal making and achieving as one of my positive attributes i tend to agree with her , so i don t plan on abandoning goal making i just need to like myself separate from them now is the time to create a new daily habit the only question left unanswered is whether i plan on doing it privately or incorporating it openly for others to observe and participate in obviously , this is just the first of many steps towards pulling self esteem and goal making apart at the seems , and it seems like on over simplistic solution , but when i thought of making this a thirty day goal , i realized quickly that this will be a very difficult goal to reach indeed
