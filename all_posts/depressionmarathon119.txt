it 's been a tough week my mood continues to decline monster fatigue has set in everything i do is more difficult everything big things , obvious things , like work , take more energy , mental fortitude , and patience than i have right now running is also more difficult i'm so tired i need to nap before i go for a run my legs feel like lead during my run so even a slow pace feels like a sprint and then i'm exhausted afterward and practically fall asleep standing up so my mile run tonight , in total , took hours rather then minutes everything requires more time and effort when my mood is low but it 's not just the big , obvious things which are more challenging small , less obvious things are difficult , too , when i do n't feel well i have routines which make my life more simple when i feel low , i get out of those routines for example , last night i did n't set out my breakfast food , or make my lunch , or even pick out which clothes i was going to wear today i do each of those things nightly in order to make my mornings go more smoothly and simply well , guess what ? this morning was more difficult it was n't simple and it was n't simple because i was unable to find the energy last night to do what i typically do seems like a little thing , but it 's another example of how everything gets more difficult when my mood is low depression manifests in so many ways making life more difficult is the manifestation i'm noticing today despite the heaviness , the brain fog , and the fatigue , i at least made it to work and continued to run this week but that 's about it meetings , socializing , errands , and chores not in the cards right now i know getting out , socializing , and getting stuff done would probably help my mood , but i just ca n't right now i can only do what i can do , and i'm at that limit i'm hoping for a reprieve soon
