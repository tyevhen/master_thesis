there is nothing like christmas to bring back memories of where you 've been , the directions your life has taken and the people who have been so special over the years some christmas memories are about people christmas , for so many years , meant aunt molly she would show up and make christmas happen for us it was n't just a matter of presents , although hers were always wonderful , well considered and so appreciated what mattered most was her infusion of christmas spirit into our otherwise depressed and chaotic household she would urge our father to stop brooding and go with us to buy the perfect tree at the los angeles train yards thrilling in the smell of pine and the crunch of needles underfoot , we 'd buy a tree fresh off a boxcar , always one a bit tall for our eight foot ceiling , always with a delicious scent aunt molly would lead us in singing round after round of christmas carols she 'd make a fire in the fireplace and we 'd settle in together for stories and songs and candy and presents , illuminated by the twinkling lights of the christmas tree and the roaring fire and suddenly , because of her , life felt cozy and normal and festive in later years , she was the center of our holiday celebrations when our parents were gone and we were adults for years , when neither my brother mike nor my sister tai were available on the holidays , aunt molly , bob and i would celebrate at our place aunt molly would arrive on early on christmas eve and we 'd have tea and tiny sandwiches at an english tea room near our home then we would make a last , recreational trip to the mall so she could enjoy all the decorations there and then go to dinner at a local restaurant that had wonderful prime rib in sensible portions when darkness fell , we would tour valencia to see all the community 's holiday lights homes with outrageously lavish light displays , whole neighborhoods decorated with a theme and with lights strung across the streets , the neighborhood ablaze with christmas cheer we always ended our tour at a modest little home in neighboring newhall where a cactus was a the main attraction in an otherwise barren front yard at christmas , that cactus was blazing with red , green and gold twinkling lights and was our favorite viewing tradition of all we would have a delicious homemade breakfast on christmas morning , open and savor our gifts and then sit down to a turkey dinner and amid all the tea , twinkling lights , treasured gifts and good food , there was laughter that rings sweetly in my memory to this day in time , aunt molly was unable to make the mile each way drive to our home and mike had joined us by then we would take turns transporting her to the holiday festivities at my house or at the house where we had grown up which mike now owned or we would carry the food and gifts to her home wherever we celebrated , it was wonderful and memorable christmas at aunt molly 's house she proposed some changes for christmas since traffic had been horrendous that thanksgiving and it had taken us all many hours to reach her home , molly proposed celebrating christmas on the th in valencia she also suggested that we go out to our favorite pasta house for spaghetti this time it 's time to celebrate christmas a new way , she said let 's try it i think it would be fun so we did mike picked her up in redlands and brought her to valencia , stopping en route to visit vroman 's , the bookstore in pasadena where she had taken us when we were children and which is our favorite bookstore to this day it was a fabulous day , full of love and laughter and delicious pasta and when bob and i took her home , i held her , feeling her sudden fraility , wishing i could hold her forever yet knowing we might be close to losing her the end came much sooner than any of us had imagined a few days later on january , she died as gracefully as she had lived and christmas has never been quite the same i have no memory of how we celebrated christmas in and , but in holidays since , we have taken her lead to create new traditions , always remembering this special person who made christmas so merry to us for so long some christmas memories , of course , are not memories at all but stories or pictures passed down from our parents and others for example , christmas when my parents and aunt molly celebrated with special joy knowing that a new baby was on the way and the next year , my first christmas , lives only as a picture my mother pasted happily in my baby book now worn with time and rich with the memory of family stories christmas with my mother l and molly r an unremembered christmas my first in some christmas memories are forever linked with a particular incident or time of life there was the christmas when , after we had brought our once again too tall for our eight foot ceiling tree home from the train yards , father was about to saw about a foot from the bottom and liz , our next door neighbor , suddenly appeared in our doorway she had been out partying with girlfriends and was feeling no pain this delightful southern belle who awed me with her ability to play honky tonk piano , to make my father laugh even when she was drawling jim mccoy , you are one silly son of a bitch ! and to make any gathering more fun with her presence usually , the more she drank , the more she loved everyone but this time , when she saw my father poised with his saw at the tree trunk , she became truly distraught woodman ! she screamed , throwing herself down on the tree woodman , spare this tree ! settling into its fragrant branches , she refused to move , kicking out at my father until he put the saw aside then she fell asleep still entwined in the branches my mother threw a quilt over liz and the tree i do n't think we ever got that tree standing upright that year there was the christmas when i was and aunt molly convinced us to go sing carols outside my father 's backyard workshop where he was brooding as usual aunt molly , mother , mike , tai and i dutifully gathered and sang heartily with no response from inside but then suddenly , the door opened and the contents of a wastebasket filled with water cascaded out the door and totally drenched me my three year old sister bristled with outrage hey , you ! she screamed , kicking the shop door open and , hands on hips , addressing our father how dare you do that to my sister ? and on christmas ! you tell her you 're sorry now ! she glared at him and stamped her foot smiling , amused at this tiny child 's fury on my behalf , he apologized and then joined us in song to this day , this is tai 's first christmas memory and she still gets mad every time she thinks of me dripping wet in the chill of a late december evening then there was the year i could n't come home for christmas i was a graduate student at northwestern university near chicago and , for the first time , was living in an apartment money was tight and my campus job required me to be there during the holidays it had been an emotionally tough few months for me and i grieved at the thought of not spending the holidays with my family but , to my surprise , that christmas ended up being one of the best it started when my roommate , with whom i did n't get along , left to spend the holidays with her family immediately , my dear friend jeanne nishida now yagi , then a senior at northwestern , moved from her holiday shuttered dorm to my apartment jeanne , too , was working and also could n't afford to fly home to hilo , hawaii for the holidays so we enjoyed our first ever white christmas together making warm memories we bought a fresh christmas tree and , as neither of us owned a car , we carried it more than a mile through the snow and four flights up to my apartment jeanne baked glorious christmas cookies we visited friends for holiday parties , gifts and good cheer we sang carols , watched the snow falling outside with new delight and agreed on chinese take out for christmas eve to this day , my memories of this holiday time in an otherwise stressful , unhappy year of my life make me smile and think warmly about jeanne , still a dear friend , who was and is such a blessing jeanne nishida yagi who made christmas ' merry ! then there was the infamous holiday , our first in our new house in valencia my brother was a medical intern and had to work on both christmas eve and christmas also , my brother and sister were n't getting along what to do ? i agreed to cook three christmas feasts three days in a row i cooked a turkey dinner for mike and aunt molly on december on the th , it was a ham dinner with all the trimmings for bob 's parents , brother and sister in law and grandmother and on christmas day itself , my kansas cousins jack and george , who were living and working in the los angeles area , their wives and my sister tai and her then husband arrived for yet another turkey dinner i was at the end of my rope when , about two hours before dinner , the turkey pan split , spilling grease all over the oven smoke roiled out of the kitchen and i snapped yelling at everyone to go out to the patio fortunately it was a warm day until the kitchen emergency was under control , the smoke had cleared and dinner had been salvaged we laughed for many years about my wild eyed hostessing that day and i have never again attempted a three day string of feasting some christmas memories are linked to things like the handmade ornaments bob 's parents made for us over the years that still delight us and hang on our christmas tree more than two decades after his mother 's death then there are the christmas holidays that have signaled new beginnings a particularly memorable new beginning was christmas when mike brought bob and me to bangkok for christmas and new year 's we enjoyed a holiday both exotic and wonderfully familiar and the highlight of our celebration was meeting mike 's fiancee jinjuta , nicknamed amp , for the first time we also enjoyed exploring a vibrant and very different city from teeming marketplaces and ladyboy cabaret shows to the famous cabbages and condoms restaurant where guests can pluck condoms rather than mints from a dish at the cashier 's desk and where a good percentage of the restaurant 's proceeds go to support family planning clinics throughout thailand but the best times of that very special holiday season were just relaxing with mike and amp , whom we came to know and love during that time , embracing her enthusiastically as a vital part of our family mike and amp engaged christmas christmas eve at cabbages and condoms restaurant , bangkok it was a chance to explore a very different culture and yet , christmas was much in evidence in thailand ! and then there was our first retired christmas in , the first in our new arizona home , when we had a christmas eve open house , inviting neighbors for dinner and song and celebration our cats got in the holiday spirit , too , especially young sweet pea who loves to have her picture taken clowning in front of the christmas tree and curling up between two cherished christmas items that were gifts from two long ago , warmly remembered patients christmas will be quiet and reflective and that feels right this year mike , amp and their two young children maggie , and henry , months , are at their home in thailand where mike recently started an exciting and challenging new job my sister tai is working the holidays at her nursing job loving the extra holiday pay in seattle with promises to visit for a delayed celebration in march so bob and i will share a christmas eve dinner of pot roast , popovers and apple pie with our friends and neighbors phyllis and wally phyllis will be recovering from yet another painful surgery only a few days before and is looking to the future , which includes starting kidney dialysis , with some trepidation we 're hoping that a quiet , but heartfelt celebration with us not to mention a much anticipated visit from her daughter kathy and son in law evan a few days later will help quiet her fears and let her know that caring and support and love are all around her phyllis and wally set to celebrate christmas eve with us bob and i will spend christmas day quietly together , remembering all the sweet holidays of our life together and the memories to be made this year and our special christmas wishes that phyllis will regain some health , strength and zest for life once her treatments begin in the new year that our national heartbreak over the recent elementary school shootings in connecticut will translate into positive change in terms of services to the mentally ill from childhood on and gun laws that make sense that the divisions we feel as a nation will begin to fade and our national unity will grow to face the challenges of this new era as quiet as our holiday will be this year , we have much to celebrate both here and from afar we feel blessed to be celebrating our th christmas together we 're blessed with our loving animals , two of whom hamish and gus graced our christmas cards this year our christmas card photo with hamish and gus we 're blessed with loving family and friends and good health and we feel blessed to watch as , for another generation , christmas magic and memories are just beginning because they 're half a world away , we 'll be part of their celebration via face time , as my nephew henry has his first christmas and my niece maggie celebrates one of the first holidays she may remember and we will be sharing their joy and wonder as another lifetime of christmas memories begins maggie , , with christmas lights in bangkok
