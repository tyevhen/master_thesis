both philip dawdy and aubrey blumsohn and others have described the tale of dr rita pal , who committed the apparently serious offense of linking to a document on her website , lost her job coincidence ? and is being further investigated by the general medical council the linked document was the transcript of the case of lisa blakemore brown , a british psychologist who was accused of misconduct feel free to read my tirade about the ludicrousness of how blakemore brown has been persecuted , the real killer here is that pal 's fitness to practice medicine is being questioned because she linked to a document that had not a thing to do with patient confidentiality and is entirely unrelated to pal 's fitness to practice medicine perhaps someone can explain how linking to a document makes one unfit to practice medicine oh , did i mention that dr pal has a blog where she frequently criticizes the british national health service ? what a great way to silence a critic trump up a patently ridiculously charge in an attempt to crush her career please read dawdy 's and blumsohn 's posts to get the whole story update a reader has posted a comment challenging the veracity of this story i'm quite interested in seeing other comments on this topic as well
