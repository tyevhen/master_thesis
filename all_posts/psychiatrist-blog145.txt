as you may be aware , we are in the process of doing research for a book called committed the battle over forced psychiatric care our plan is to include a chapter on guns and mental illness , and i'm interested in talking to gun owners who believe they are suffering with mental health issues , but wo n't seek care because they are worried this will impact their right to own firearms i'm well aware that gun owners often say they 'd never see a therapist , or never take psychiatric medications , but what one does for a theoretical problem may well be different then what one does while they are actually suffering so if you 'd be willing to share your story of how you are avoiding treatment , or worked your way around your concerns , i 'd love to hear from you , either in the comment section of this post , or by direct email to shrinkrapblog at gmail dot com obviously , real names wo n't be used in a manuscript and , as always , thank you for visiting shrink rap today and for sending this post to anyone you know who might be interested in participating addendum i 'll take any interesting story about the intersection of guns and mental health must be in the us , but from a patient , a doctor , a family member , someone afraid to get care , someone who did get care and had a happy or unhappy outcome just a guns and mental health story that 's a little more involved then 'my shrink asked me to lock my gun away and i did '
