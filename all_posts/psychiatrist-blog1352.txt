joseph juy over at corpus callosum posted a review of some articles in the recent issue of archives of general psychiatry one of the articles was national trends in psychotherapy by office based psychiatrists by ramin mojtabai mark olfson arch gen psychiatry he linked to an la times summary of the article , which suggested that medications were increasingly replacing psychotherapy joseph 's take on the newspaper article was right on the money that the article did not address whether medications were replacing psychotherapy , but instead , what the study says , is that psychiatrists are , on average , spending a smaller proportion of their time doing psychotherapy it is possible indeed , likely that other practitioners are doing the psychotherapy , while the psychiatrists are devoting more of their time to medication management i'm going to go one step further and say that it does n't even say that though it still is probably true what the study says is that psychiatrists are billing for fewer and fewer psychotherapy visits click on the image above and it takes you to a pdf of the form that survey participants used as part of the national ambulatory medical care survey , which is what this study is based on it 's a lot to complete , and i'm guessing that participating psychiatrists had an office staffer complete these forms and the office staff probably decided whether to darken the psychotherapy square only for patients scheduled for minutes or an hour or , maybe based on the billing code used i doubt that they asked the doc after each visit if she used psychotherapy with the patient anyway , here is what the study found results psychotherapy was provided in of visits weighted sampled during a year period the percentage of visits involving psychotherapy declined from in to in p this decline coincided with changes in reimbursement , increases in managed care , and growth in the prescription of medications at the practice level , the decrease in providing psychotherapy corresponded with a decline in the number of psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy to all of their patients from in to in p psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy to all of their patients relied more extensively on self pay patients , had fewer managed care visits , and prescribed medications in fewer of their visits compared with psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy less often conclusions there has been a recent significant decline in the provision of psychotherapy by psychiatrists in the united states this trend is attributable to a decrease in the number of psychiatrists specializing in psychotherapy and a corresponding increase in those specializing in pharmacotherapy changes that were likely motivated by financial incentives and growth in psychopharmacological treatments in recent years i was n't able to find my issue of agp around the house , but i'm sure that these limitations of the study were discussed nonetheless , i'm not here so much to critique an article i did n't read as i am to explain about how psychiatrists bill for their services so , anyway , i submitted a comment to joseph 's post , which wound up being so long i thought i 'd post it here , regarding how psychiatrist office visits usually get coded , or billed when psychiatrists submit a bill to an insurance company , there are generally types of codes one can use , which are called cpt codes for current procedural terminology one is called an e m code evaluation management this would mostly be one of these , , , , each one is more complex or time consuming than the next , with escalating payments use of this code requires a specific type of documentation a number of insurance companies may either not pay for this code for psychiatrists , or require a preauthorization the next are psychotherapy codes , which are based on time and the main ones are min , min , and min these also require some specific documentation and payments escalate there are other codes which are used when there is no e m component , such as , , , but most psychiatrists actually do evaluate and manage treatment with each visit , though they may use these even codes if they do n't want to bother with the documentation , which can be quite onerous finally , there is the medication management code , or there is no time attached to this one , so whether you spend one minute or one hour with a patient , you can use this one it is paid about the same as a and a bit less than a there are very little documentation requirements and rarely requires a preauthorization , so it is the easiest one to use many psychiatrists will use this code , yet still provide psychotherapy to a patient during the session , commonly to minutes long a few docs may only see pts for or minutes , if the pt is well known to them , or in a busy clinic , but this is probably not the standard so , since the abstract was unclear on this matter , i thought i 'd do some teaching about how it works given how the study was done , i think that it only truly speaks to the success of managed care policies in paying less and less for psychiatric treatment of course , you get what you pay for
