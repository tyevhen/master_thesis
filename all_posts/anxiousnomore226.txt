on this fourth of july i ca n't help but think about how lucky i am to live in this country we may not be granted happiness , but we are given so many things that help us with the pursuit of it and is n't that what life is all about ? is n't that what we are all striving for every day ? to find our own personal happiness , personal peace of mind and acceptance in this world when i went to india a few years back , my eyes were opened up to just how lucky i am walking through the streets i saw these children running amuck , dirty , unsupervised , barefoot and their clothes were hanging off of them my hearts went out to them they loved getting their picture taken and seeing it on the camera i went back a few months later and saw them again to my delight , but nothing had changed most everyone lived in cramped apartments and if you were n't that lucky you would be in a shanty or a small room made out of tin with a tarp for a roof your children would be playing in the sewers or helping you work doing construction i came home to my bedroom starter home with a raised ceiling and thought that i lived in a mansion and felt so unbelievably blessed we all have our problems but i ca n't help but feel grateful today for all that our country offers us do n't get me wrong , india is beautiful and has a very rich fascinating culture however , the average person here in america lives a much richer life with streets that are clean , dogs that are put in shelters and not left to fill the streets , and food that is n't sold on the ground two feet next to the trash infested ditches so as you go to your family bbq , the city parade or carnival , while watching the fireworks or seeing a movie , whatever your family tradition might be , look around at all that you have tomorrow might be full of complaints but maybe today we can just be grateful for our blessings and opportunities that make the pursuit a little easier if interested here are some more of my pictures from india enjoy ! if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety
