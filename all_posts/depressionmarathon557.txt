things are going fairly smoothly i'm still awaiting a call from a prospective new employer i know the decision has come down to me and one other person my inside contact overheard my prospective new boss say she wanted to make a decision by the weekend , but apparently that did n't happen it bothers me that it 's turning out to be such a difficult decision obviously , she likes some things about each one of us oh well i'm trying to be patient i have some other prospects on the horizon if this does n't work out my current job is going okay right now things have calmed down around there it 's been a little just a little less negative and toxic but my boss works her last day next week , and they have n't even begun orienting her replacement yet that 's pretty unbelievable since she 's going to be supervising us and responsible for the entire department i think the higher ups are going to eat her alive it will be interesting when i get back from boston i pray that things go well for all of us on another note , my running is going well i had two good , fast workouts this week , and tomorrow is my last long run only miles before boston that 's pretty exciting unfortunately , my left achilles tendon is really , really sore i'm definitely going to have to rest after boston in order for it to heal i'm not looking forward to that if you 've been around here for awhile , you know my mood does n't respond well to running layoffs so the slide that began last week seems to have resolved it was relatively brief i think speaking to the students on tuesday helped other than that , i just tried to stick to my routine and said my prayers i do n't know what stopped the slide , and i do n't care it stopped , and right now i'm enjoying some relative calm never underestimate the value of relative calm , my friends
