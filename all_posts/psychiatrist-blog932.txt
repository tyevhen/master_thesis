katina writes to us from onlinecolleges to let us know about a post on which jobs are the top ten most depressing check it out here professions with the highest levels of depression what i found to be interesting is that the assumption is that the jobs cause the depression for example social workers if you had to deal with abused children , unkind foster parents and less than stellar family dynamics all day , you might be depressed too those working in this field are three times more likely to be depressed than the general population , and many are so focused on helping others they do n't get the help that they need themselves there 's nothing in the post that addresses the chicken or egg ? question maybe people with depression are drawn to certain fields artists are listed , with the statement that those who chose to work in the field found it depressing and everyone kind of gets it doctors , nurses , social workers , lawyers , artists , janitors , food service people , finance , nursing home and childcare workers what 's left ? what 's the depression rate among bloggers ?
