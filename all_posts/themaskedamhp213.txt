david was in his s i had had to detain him under the mental health act on a couple of occasions in the past he had a diagnosis of schizophrenia , but had long periods of being well , and never happily engaged with psychiatric services during his most recent hospital stay , about a year previously , he had left the ward one day and gone into charwood town centre and entered a bank he had patiently waited his turn , and when he reached the front of the queue had politely requested money to use to alleviate poverty and suffering in the world unaccountably , even though david had not been armed and had shown no aggression , the cashier handed over a considerable quantity of cash to him , which he then distributed to passers by in the street until the police arrived to take him back to hospital he had subsequently disengaged from the cmht and no one had seen him in recent months , except for a couple of occasions when he had turned up unannounced asking to see me on both occasions i gained the impression that he was somehow playing with me , offering tantalising glimpses of a florid mental illness , as if he were challenging me to section him , then laughing at me when i tried to probe him he was clearly enjoying himself , enjoying his illness but he was also in control a few weeks later his mother turned up at the doctor s surgery one day , dragging a reluctant david with her the cmht consultant happened to be holding a clinic at the surgery at the time , saw david with the gp , concluded that he was extremely unwell , and the two had completed medical recommendations for detention under sec mha by the time the news reached me , he had gone home with his mother i went round to conduct my assessment david s mother answered the door and let me in his sister was also there david looked drawn and haggard , and not at all happy , in marked contrast to my last contact with him it looked as if he had now lost control of his illness the illness was now controlling him he was clearly irritable , with aggression seething underneath his calm exterior he was carrying a wet flannel i m going to hit you with this flannel , he said , smiling rigidly he flicked my head with it , then threw it at me , as if he wanted me to play catch i caught it i know what you re thinking , he said but you re wrong i m not mad , you know , and i can prove it to you i can project thoughts into your head he closed his eyes and concentrated but i was not aware of any thought insertion i don t think that worked , i said but i do think you are unwell then i may as well kill myself , hadn t i ? he said although he continued to smile , a tear flowed down his cheek i took his mother and sister to one side david s very unwell , i said i m very worried about him he does need to be in hospital i really don t want him to go , his mother said hospital won t do him any good he d be better off here with his family we can take care of him i don t want him to be sectioned i talked it over with them i explained my concerns since we were considering a sec i didn t need the approval of the nearest relative they pleaded with me to give them a chance to get him well at home they assured me they would make sure he had his medication , that they wouldn t leave him alone for even a minute , that they would let us know if they had any concerns , however small , that they would call us or the police the minute he tried to leave the house i decided to give it a try this did , after all , constitute an alternative to compulsory admission , it was worth trying as part of the decision making process i had the two medical recommendations , i could review the situation daily , and complete an application at any time if i felt that things were breaking down i explained this to david i told him that if he wanted to avoid going into hospital he would have to take the medication and stay with his mother and sister i told him i would visit him tomorrow to see how he was getting on he smiled and nodded , smiled and nodded he was still smiling and nodding as i left i had barely returned to the cmht when i received a call from his mother david s gone ! she shouted just after you left he grabbed his car keys and he s gone off in his car ! he said he s going to kill himself ! my mouth felt very dry as i completed my application , formally detaining him under sec then i rang the police , explaining the situation to them then i waited i discovered that chewing my fingernails helped to pass the time about half an hour later , the phone rang it was the police we ve had a report of an incident , the police officer said a car went through a red light at road works and hit a lorry head on there s an ambulance on its way now the officer promised to keep me updated i sat in the office , thinking worrying worrying about david worrying about myself would i have to give evidence at an inquest ? what would i say ? where would the finger of blame point ? a few minutes later i received another call a man answering the description of your patient was driving the vehicle the ambulance is taking him to hospital now we don t have any more details i set off for the hospital , and went to the accident and emergency department , dreading what i would find how badly injured would he be ? would he survive ? was anyone else injured ? but he was the only casualty and miraculously and also because he was wearing a seatbelt he had escaped with nothing worse than a few cuts and bruises in fact , he was medically fit for discharge and since woodland house psychiatric unit was on the same site as the general hospital , i arranged for him to be taken directly to bluebell ward
