depression is extremely powerful but it is not at all intelligent and we can outsmart it seven days a week if we practice some simple mind exercises and mental techniques and this eternal striving to take charge of our thinking helps us grow stronger and more confident in ourselves we must refuse to act upon our depressed feelings , knowing that they are not necessarily objective reality depression is not regular life it is our own private hell of self absorption we ca n't sit around and wait for our life to get fixed up so we can then jump back into it like some kind of movie our only hope is to decide , as an act of will , to get up anyway , even if we do n't feel like it , and take some small positive action run , or take a walk , take out the garbage , make the bed , volunteer to clean up the highway doing anything helps
