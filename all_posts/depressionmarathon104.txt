one of my supervisors left me a note yesterday we 've been really busy , and i worked later than usual yesterday i was actually the last one in the office when i returned to my desk from my patient 's room there was a handwritten note thanking me for all you do it was a simple note on plain paper , likely scribbled on her way out the door , but it made a difference in my day it changed my attitude about being there later than usual and made my drive home a little more serene i appreciated her note so much i folded it up and took it home i'm looking at it right now why throw it away ? every time i look at it , the note reminds me of her kind gesture it reminds me someone appreciates what i do it acknowledges i'm making a difference that 's pretty cool i like the reminders i'm glad i did n't toss it out saying thank you it 's such a simple thing to do my supervisor 's note reminds me i need to pay it forward i need to make sure i'm thanking others for their kindness , hard work , or friendship i think i do an okay job of saying thanks , but there 's always room for improvement and when i'm feeling stressed or overwhelmed , which i may be on the verge of feeling right now , it 's probably even more important for me to remember what others are doing for me rather than concerning myself only with what i am doing for others just a thought
