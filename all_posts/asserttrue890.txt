i 've learned some interesting things about the way selections work in mozilla every window has a singleton selection object , even when the user has selected no items on the rendered page therefore , window getselection always succeeds if you simply want user selected text as a string , getselection tostring will work but if you really intend to walk the selected dom nodes , or process the selection in any non trivial way , you will need access its range objects with window getselection getrangeat i there is a rangecount property on the range object , so that you can know how many ranges were selected by the user in firefox and prior , the rangecount was never more than one but in firefox , the user can do multi selection of page contents try it hold the control key down as you swipe across various pieces of a page that means the range count can be more than one if you need to process a range 's contents , be sure to use the clonecontents method , not the extractcontents method the latter will actually remove nodes from the dom tree , affecting the rendered page 's appearance that is to say , content suddenly disappears ! this is all spelled out at the moz developer center page on ranges
