you know , i'm years old , and this is the first time in my life i have been this close to cancer i guess i 've been lucky i 've had friends with parents , siblings , or others in their lives who have had cancer every time i work i treat patients with often debilitating cancer or long histories of living with cancer and i 've known plenty of people who have had pre cancerous or cancerous skin lesions removed , but i 've not ever had a friend or family member diagnosed i never thought about this before today never had reason to think about it until learning that my friend will die from her cancer maybe months , hopefully years but it will take her nonetheless i 've been lucky not to have been this close before i had the unfortunate opportunity to think about another irony today an hour prior to learning of my friend 's cancer , i learned that a colleague 's nephew killed himself yesterday afternoon despite my family history of mental illness , my former career in mental health , and my own battle with depression i have not had to directly endure the trauma of suicide a former college professor and counselor of mine did commit suicide , but i had long since graduated and knew nothing of her plight until many months after she had died i was spared the horror my co worker is presently experiencing again i 've been fortunate , and i'm grateful for that side note now that i am thinking about it , my former professor 's battle with depression apparently began after she had surgery for brain cancer my thoughts in comparison to these two events are trivial , and i am a bit embarrassed to even write them down i did not want this post to be about me the last thing either of my stricken friends would care about tonight are my ironies nonetheless , today i was struck by the shock of these coinciding events and by my unfamiliarity with each of them i wish i was doing a better job of explaining my feelings , trivial though they may be i guess that 's why i started to write this post to come to some understanding of what it is i am feeling shocked sad unsure i am feeling shocked , sad , and unsure okay now what do i do ? i think i 'll start with a prayer thanks for listening good night
