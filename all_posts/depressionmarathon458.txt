i finally got back on the road i went for a run on saturday it had been at least days since my last run this was more of a slog than a run , but at least i got out of the house my feet moved my lungs expanded i breathed in the fresh air i coughed i kept going i took it slow , the coughing got better , and i made it miles before calling it quits i just got in from another run it was colder tonight , and the footing was dicey i took it slow again i got tired more quickly than i would have liked , but i felt satisfied when i finished i hate starting over i hate when easy running feels hard but i am so , so glad to be back on the road ! i am not complaining ! i think i 'll probably be taking things slow for a little while my chest is still congested i do n't know maybe i had pneumonia again because this thing is really hanging on i'm better , but there is still gunk in one area in my chest it 's weird once in awhile i can reach it with a cough , but most of my coughing is just annoying and unproductive i sound like a smoker for crying out loud ! i guess i just need to be patient at least i'm running again ! speaking of running , i 've decided to run grandma 's marathon again this year it is weeks from now on saturday , june nd as most of you know , i function much better when i have a goal the plan to run grandma 's will keep getting me out the door when i'm feeling tired or low i 've already typed out the week training schedule i 'll use this week to just get my feet back under me , and next week , the beginning of the schedule , is also easy like i said , i'm doing my best to take things slow patience i guess that 's the lesson for today i'm working on my acceptance and patience i need to accept where i'm at today and try to be patient with my return to form i think i'm off to a fairly good start
