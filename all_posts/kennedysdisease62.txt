as we age , many of us with kennedy 's disease begin to lose some of our facial muscles specifically , the cheek and lip muscles begin to atrophy one day , we find ourselves looking in the mirror and noticing we no longer have a smile in fact , it looks more like a crooked sneer i saw it on my face for the first time a couple of years ago it was not too noticeable at first , but over time , i found myself becoming more self conscious with the sneer where once i thought i had a good smile , i now find myself not smiling when my picture is taken i will grin , but that is as far as it goes about three months ago , i noticed that the left side of my mouth mainly the lower lip was drooping slightly it is not too bad yet , but it is drooping down i often catch myself with my mouth slightly open my wife calls it catching flies i remember my older brother whose bottom lip drooped dramatically in my second blog post titled , now i am my brother , i mentioned that as i grow older i look and act more like my brother the drooping lip and sneer are just two more examples of the progression of the disease for the last few years , i have been doing face and throat exercises daily to help keep the muscles toned the exercises seem to help , but i cannot seem to stop the progression i never considered myself a vain person , but my discomfort with my crooked smile sneer is causing me to think before i smile in public who thought that would happen i guess i should be thankful that i had a good , wholesome smile for all of these years not like some people
