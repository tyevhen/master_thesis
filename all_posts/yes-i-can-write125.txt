you know what 's been missing from this blog recently ? anything at all personal , or actually about my life in the here and now well , that 's not entirely accurate everything i write is personal really , in the sense it 's important to me and draws heavily on my personal experiences and background but often , writing all the posts about unschooling that i do , as much as they draw on my life , i feel like there 's a distance between where i am in my life and what 's happening as i write the post , and the post itself so i decided that today felt like a good time to write about what 's been happening in my life , how i 've been doing , and all that jazz considering it 's been a long time since i wrote about my life at all , i feel like there 's a lot of catching up to do since the fall , when i did a ton of stuff , and then just came home to cold weather and not much of a local community , i have n't exactly felt at my best well , okay , i'm trying to be honest here i 've been downright depressed , on and off no , not clinical depression , but the kind where you 're miserable , have no motivation to do anything , feel drained by being constantly cold i do n't do well in cold weather , and find being around people too frustrating to bother doing top that off with some seriously self hating feelings and stress caused by external events , and it 's really not fun i want to make it clear that i have n't been feeling constantly horrible since the fall just that i 've been dealing with all this since the fall , to a greater or lesser extent depending on the time what external events , you ask ? well , a couple of them are other peoples business , or too private to share details publicly online , but suffice it to say there were days of hospital visits while my father was sick and in the hospital he 's better now worrying about and trying to help a friend , and really wonderful person , whose life has been going to hell and a repeat of the whole thing i went through when turning both and birthdays tend to be a little rough for me , now that i'm rapidly approaching my th birthday it 's on march th i feel like this , now , as i leave my teen years , is when people are going to expect me to be an adult even more than ever i start obsessing about the fact i'm not earning money right now , and start thinking that everyone must secretly think i'm a failure because of it , even if they pretend not to yes , i realize this is neither rational nor true birthdays are rough or , at least , the time leading up to them is because this year , i 've decided to do something different this year , for my th birthday , i'm renting a house , apartment , or similar place for a week , and hosting a gathering ! some really great friends are coming , and i'm so looking forward to it though there 's definitely still stress attached to organizing it what if hardly anyone ends up being able to come ? what if people do n't enjoy it ? and even worse , what if i do n't find a good place to rent ? yes , that 's right , i have n't found a good place yet if you have ideas a place you know of , please contact me ! i can get sucked into thinking about things in a negative way really , really easily i'm also writing an unschooling zine ! like , not an ezine , but an actual , hold in your hands zine , that i'm going to be selling once it 's finished at the anarchist bookfair as well as by order , of course it 'll be available to all you lovely blog readers who are interested ! i started it a couple months ago , and have hardly written any more for it since , but i plan on changing that now that i have a deadline the bookfair ! it 'll cover all the basics , in a series of short chapters , so it 'll really be like a short book on unschooling this project is pretty exciting to me ! which leads me to another thing right now , the only place i write is in my often dark and cold bedroom , on my desktop computer that 's it i do n't have a laptop , and the only time i can ever bring myself to write with pen and paper is when i'm writing poems otherwise , i get way too frustrated at the slowness and hand cramping , plus i 'd have to then transcribe it onto the computer shudders in horror so i 've been looking seriously into getting a laptop , and thus being able to write in the rest of the house , outside in the sunshine , in cafes , when i'm traveling problem is , i have no money well , okay , i have a very small amount of money which is all going towards my big birthday bash next month everyone who 's coming is chipping in , but that still means i'm paying my portion some of you may remember me posting about wanting a laptop on my blog 's facebook page , and i was thrilled and so grateful to actually have a couple of people offer to give me their old laptops ! ! the kindness of people can be amazing so i was going to get one from a local friend , only when she was getting it ready , it decided to crash so , no laptop and that has made me realize that if i get a really old used laptop from someone , i'm planning on doing lots of writing on it , and it could crash at any moment thus destroying all my work so i think i should maybe look at getting the lowest end cheapest new or newly refurbished laptop i can find except i still do n't have any money , which is a dilemma , but i 've got a couple vague ideas in mind that may , possibly , be helpful so , is that enough rambling about my life for you ? are n't you glad i do n't do this very often ? but i do feel it 's important every now and then to , i do n't know , check in with readers , i suppose , so that those who are interested can see behind the i try to have well edited posts with real points , and into what 's really happening in idzie 's life you might also like against the current talk from the toronto unschooling conference trips and ukuleles and anarchists , oh my ! how i learned to write it involved a lot of reading ! insecurities and an anniversary three years blogging and writing from the heart linkwithin
