i 've loved teen fiction for a long time also labeled as fiction for young adult or young people , depending on the library , bookstore , or publisher in question i 've been reading books written for teens before i was one , and will most likely continue reading them long after i 've left my teenage years behind and a couple of days ago , i realized something interesting in the specific sub genre of teenage fantasy , the main characters are usually resourceful , very independently capable , yet also able to function well as a part of a group , brave , and just generally a person to respect this finally clicked with me after reading a wonderful book this past week , entitled runemarks , by joanne harris our heroine , maddy , makes no effort to obey the arbitrary rules of her elders , or to follow the norms of the very controlling culture she 's born into when at age , she finds someone she considers to be an appropriate mentor , she demands to be taught how to use her magic , and years later , at age , she goes behind the back of that same mentor to go on a dangerous journey in an attempt to save his life this book told a great story , but more than that , it was a perfect example of the respect for young people often showed in young adult fantasy fiction not by any means always , but certainly often in how many young adult fantasy books do you find the young main characters being constantly shadowed and guided by their parents , teachers , or other guardians ? how an adult used a teen as their puppet to save the world would n't make a very engaging plot now , would it ? so this leads me to something else if so many people can happily write about teens as such responsible , strong , and interesting people , and if so many adults can cheerfully buy these books for their teens , and if so many teachers can reccomend them , they must , on some level , realize that real life teens can be just as responsible , and strong , and interesting people as those in books because even when set in the most fantastically unbelievable worlds , all good fiction has a feeling of authenticity to it good fiction has to feel real if the idea of teens doing such amazing things seemed entirely unathentic , would n't people comment on it more ? would n't the sheer impossibility of it turn people off ? i feel like the knowledge , the knowing , is out there , and adults just need to get past that block in their heads that causes them to think that , although some teens out there might be capable people , the real life teens in their life certainly are n't ! at least there 's lots of great teen fantasy novels out there getting the message out peace , idzie you might also like how i learned to write it involved a lot of reading ! unschooling and trust in the adolescent years teenage teenage rebellion an unschooling , respectfully parented the best young adult fantasy novels of linkwithin
