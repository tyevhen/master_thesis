it may not always be possible to prevent depression however , there are several things we can do to stop an approaching episode becoming severe or long lasting here are some things that i have learnt that can either prevent us from succumbing to depression , or at least , stop it becoming severe or long lasting had i known these things back in , i would not have become so severely depressed trust in god it is imperative that we completely , totally , utterly trust in god , recognising that he is in control of all things , even when it seems like our lives are a complete mess and out of control life is like riding in a bus , and the bus drive is jesus we can be comforted by the fact that the bus driver always knows the destination and how to get there central to trusting in god is that we know him intimately jesus said , now this is eternal life that they may know you , the only true god , and jesus christ , whom you have sent john if we view god as being distant and aloof , we cannot trust in him completely and this will cause problems when we encounter life s storms selwyn hughes writes but the plain fact is this when we are close to god and have a deep and intimate relationship with him , we may feel downcast but not destroyed maintain a realistic outlook upon life life is not one big happy joy ride , everyone goes through trials and experiences times of discouragement and disappointment we must expect such times as well as better times of joy , satisfaction , and achievement however , there is no need to fear such trials , because when they come , jesus will be there , ready to help us deal with them in i subscribed to the erroneous belief that god would always keep me safe from disasters and severe trials exercise regularly being physically fit helps all areas of our lives it can boost our immune system , reduce the effects of illness , strengthen our bodies and help prevent injuries , make our minds more flexible and alert , boost our confidence , lift our emotions , and even improve our spiritual condition i was not engaging in any form of exercise in eat well it is crucial that we maintain a healthy diet we should not skip meals , especially breakfast , the most important meal of the day we need to have a balanced diet included plenty of water , fruit , meat and vegetables however , in rare cases where a healthy diet makes us worse , we should see a doctor and get a blood test to check if we have any food intolerances such as being gluten or fructose intolerant in , i ate poorly and skipped many meals sleep well sleep is a crucial part of staying healthy typically , someone needs seven to eight hours sleep a night the occasional bout of insomnia is not a problem , but if afflicted by chronic insomnia , we need to see a doctor and see what can be done about it i suffered from chronic insomnia in rest and recreation we must take care that our live does not become all work and no play at least one whole day a week must be set aside for rest and recreation , and we also need to set aside some time for ourselves each day rest and recreation can include social activities with friends , hobbies , sports , going for a walk , reading a book or watching tv , going to church , and so on in , i was so busy working full time as well as working part time as an assistant pastor , that i left almost no time to pursue my hobbies or rest deal with fears traumas this is one of the most important issues in preventing depression we need to receive counselling from a pastor counsellor or professional therapist , if we have deep seated irrational fears or past traumas that are constantly tripping us up or causing anxiety attacks these problems need to be faced , addressed , and dealt with , so that we can be free from them for the rest of our lives during i struggled constantly with panic attacks and fearful thoughts , which were largely linked to past traumas and associated faulty theology i also suffered a major shock , but rather than seek help , i tried to sweep it under the carpet and go on as though it had never happened learn strategies to cope with anxiety if we struggle with anxiety , it is crucial that we learn coping strategies to deal with it for example , we need to understand how anxiety works , how to react to difficult situations and fear , so that we do not fall prey to the deceptive fear adrenalin fear cycle i learnt many practical coping strategies from the book , self help for your nerves by dr claire weekes , and have shared many on this blog in , i knew nothing about anxiety attacks and had not learnt any coping techniques let go of the past dwelling on injustices inflicted upon us by others , or even upon our own past mistakes , can afflicts us with anger , bitterness and or guilt , which are very powerful and destructive emotions although not easy to do , we need to forgive others and ourselves be active in a local church we need to be in a supportive christian environment such as a local church or cell group , so that we can both receive support , encouragement and prayer , and have the opportunity to serve the lord by helping others every day with jesus , jan feb issue ,
