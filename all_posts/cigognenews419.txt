clearly those who lack it need it , as trite as that may sound how do we know who lacks it ? that is the question , and here is the answer children who grow up traumatized and unloved will need extra helpings later on to get over it i define lack of love as not fulfilling specific needs of the child and that child lived a previous life life in the womb and he could sense and feel unloved while being carried because he can sense when his needs are not met he can sense hunger , terror , fear , hopeless , and so on all this deprivation leaves a mark or tag on the dna of the genes and changes the outcome and unravelling of that gene it can keep the cell from traveling to its proper genetic destination and choose another destination for us , from hopelessness to cancer or alzheimers , for example when there is heavy methylation on the genes in infancy it may indicate some kind of trauma or deprivation earlier on increased methylation is a sign of trouble in denmark so it may be that cancer later in life is the outcome of no love during womb life we plan to correlate difficult womb life with serious disease we want to see if our psychotherapy can reverse methylation meanwhile , who needs more love ? those who did not get enough early on they need an additional helping i am not sure that will reverse methylation but it may keep it from getting worse the point is that our biochemistry may speak volumes about our early deprivation even though we are convinced that we were always loved it is why i am leery of paper and pencil questionnaires in research taking the word of patients taking their pulse may be much more accurate so who needs love ? what those who are deprived need even more than love is the feeling of no love of going back and feeling the early deprivation that is what is liberating it is what lifts the lid of repression and allows the person to be open enough for love to get in and do its best a recent study reported by hanne johnson science news dec , looked into kids ages , took blood samples in those who were reared in orphanages versus those reared in a stable home they profiled their genomes and found that those who grew up in institutions had a great number of epigenetic changes in cells that are involved with immune function and also those that regulated brain function early stress from separation from one 's parents impacted later physical and mental health and these children may be over sensitive to unhappy or harsh circumstances later on they can take less adversity to try to parent early deprived children is a double burden for the new parents they have to make up for early deprivation , and i am not sure it can always be done in other words , to try to undo methylation will take great effort if that methylation of the genome is to be reversed judging by some of our studies or reversing neurosis vital signs , cortisol , imipramine binding , etc it is possible to remove some of the imprinted pain , whether that means reversal of methylation we will have to see
