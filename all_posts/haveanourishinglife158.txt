sometimes i get so frustrated with myself i am impatient with the progress i am making in the recovery department it is may already , for pete 's sake ! i expected my brain to heal so much faster than it is when i look at the long road ahead of me , i see so much work that needs to be done it s discouraging , disheartening , and exhausting i am tempted to surrender , raise the white flag , give up , raise my hands in despair , throw in the towel , and every other phrase that has to do with defeat even in recovery , my perfectionist tendencies hold me back i have to remind myself how much progress i have made in just one year s time i found an old journal entry from last year these have been bad days since saturday night , i ve lost control i hopelessly strayed from my plan and lost sight of all things right i thought i might be saved on sunday , but i was not i will start over tomorrow i still can t do it today i pretend everything s alright , but it s not i want to kill this person talking inside of me right now do i have to be so rigid with my standards ? if i don t though , this is what happens ! i need a strict eating and praying schedule so that i can pay for all of my mistakes i ve made since saturday i think the above entry was written on a thursday i don t know exactly what i was talking about but i am going to guess that my mistakes were eating things that weren t on my diet plan here is another old entry from last year today is monday and it s a m and i didn t go to work i am ignoring all responsibility and pretending like it s no big deal i am such a spoiled , lazy , ungrateful , despicable person how can i be so selfish ? what the heck is wrong with me ? i knew i wasn t going to work today i knew it on friday maybe , i would have been okay , but i doubt it i am a mess i can t live with myself i continue to fail and let myself down this old entry , i know for a fact , is about the expectations i put on myself i did n't realize it at the time , but i was struggling with severe depression and anxiety and i was blaming myself for it i couldn t take care of myself i had daily breakdowns and i had constant suicidal thoughts yet , i still thought it was my fault i still thought i had to pick myself up by my own boot straps reading through my old journal was a painfully tough experience in the past , i used journaling as an outlet when i thought i was going to explode so , reading my writings is like going back into that diseased and tormented mind it is hard to read , but it is good because i now realize how far i ve come i am doing so much better than i was last year wow so so so much better if i am being impatient with myself , i have to remember to be kind to myself if i feel like i am not better it s because i expect to be better it really all comes down to expectations throw the expectations out the window and i am cured ! i'm a healthy , content , stay at home wife if i didn t have any more expectations of myself , than i would be fine i don t want to go back to the way i was i really don t want to go back to the way i was this is what i don t want to go back to i am afraid of the road i am on i am afraid i am going to kill myself sometimes it seems so rational that i kill myself when i am at the really low points , i can t think straight i don t know what to do now , and i don t know what to do next nothing will change because i can t change anything on my own i believe with all my heart , i survived so i could tell my story if there was no hope , then i would not be here today i am here to tell you that there is hope there is always hope ! everyone s journey is different things that worked for me might not work for you but the bottom line is ask for help and remember , it is ok to ask for help no matter what , ask for help you are never stuck there is always someone willing to help keep asking , keep trying you deserve it ! no matter how undeserving you feel , you still deserve to get better ! even thought it is not yet mental health awareness week , i think it is important to address your mental health every day christine saah of made in his image blog wrote that the silence is killing the world , literally mental health issues are taboo in our society i thought that if i want to help break the silence , i might as well start here no one wants to talk about suicide , eating disorders , anxiety , or depression however , since , suicide is now the leading cause of death in the united states if you want to break the silence with me , i will pray for you i am always praying for you repeat after me , because of the grace of god , i am alive and well you can do it , i believe in you top photo the sorrowful mother , painted copy by mary borchers i do n't know who did the original
