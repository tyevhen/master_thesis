many dna processing genes have an unusual amount of internal complementarity regions of dna in which the dna can fold back on itself to form stable structures a good example is the ding gene of mycobacterium tuberculosis , which encodes an atp dependent helicase using the dinamelt server 's quikfold app , i obtained the following structure prediction for the first , bases of the , bases long ding gene of m tuberculosis erdman strain structure prediction for one strand of the m tuberculosis ding gene first , bases almost the entire sequence folds back on itself the only part of the original sequence that does n't self anneal is the tiny straight line at the lower right red arrow click to enlarge remarkably , almost the entire sequence can form a stable self annealing structure only a few bases see red arrow , above lack the ability to form secondary structure bear in mind , what we 're looking at is a stable conformation involving one strand of dna only each of the two strands of ding can form this structure , independently of one another the structure shown above has a tm melting temperature of c in m saline , with mean free energy enthalpy of minus kcal mol and a c gibbs free energy g of minus kcal , meaning that at c , formation of the stable structure shown here or one very much like it is , energetically speaking , strongly favored structures of this kind are often considered to occur in rna , but if they also occur in single stranded dna , it raises interesting questions if a gene has an energetically stable strands apart configuration , getting the strands of duplex b form dna to separate might not be so hard but more to the point , getting the self annealing gene to come back together again as duplex dna will require significant energy input in molecular genetics , we 're accustomed to the idea of duplex dna requiring help from an atp dependent helicase to open up unwind the double helix in preparation for replication or transcription the above diagram suggests that the problem is n't opening up a gene the greater problem may be bringing the strands together again after they 've assumed a stable strands apart secondary structure there 's a substantial energy barrier to be overcome before the above structure can be relaxed into randomly coiling dna this suggests that certain genes , like ding , may be modal in terms of strand separation state once the gene 's strands are apart , they want to stay apart there 's an energy barrier to bringing the strands together again it 's ironic that a helicase gene ding has so much single strand secondary structure the gene product is a dna powered helicase the gene needs its own protein product in order to zip up again but maybe that 's the point ? maybe it 's a non accidental feature in general , bacteria tend to have a remarkable number of helicase genes m tuberculosis for example has different helicases other species have even more see table organism helicase genes myxococcus xanthus strain dk frankia sp strain qa streptomyces cf griseus strain xylebkg clostridium botulinum hall strain psychromonas ingrahamii strain mesorhizobium sp strain bnc bacillus cereus strain f escherichia coli b rel anabaena cylindrica strain pcc mycobacterium tuberculosis erdman strain caulobacter crescentus strain na one might ask why this is so why would a bacterium need , , , or different helicases ? it 's quite unusual for a bacterial genome to have significant redundancy of genes , because when there are two copies of a given gene , one copy usually eventually becomes disabled pseudogenized and lost through random mutations the very few exceptions to this rule tend to involve highly transcribed , highly necessary genes such as ribosomal rna genes it would be extremely unlikely for m tuberculosis to carry around flavors of a gene if they were n't all absolutely necessary duplicates would almost certainly be lost over time , especially in m tuberculosis , which lacks a mismatch repair system bacteria that lack mismatch repair enzymes have been shown experimentally to lose dna fifty times faster than other bacteria the most parsimonious view is that the helicases of m tuberculosis are , in fact , critically necessary and perform different jobs i would suggest that perhaps the reason bacteria have so many helicases is that these are actually the nucleic acid chaperones that manage secondary structure in the sizable minority of genes that exhibit pronounced self annealing of separated strands it could be that most helicases are tasked with separating individual strands of dna and or rna from themselves different types of secondary structure require different types of helicase to unravel this might be why bacteria need so many helicases references helpful articles on dna secondary structure dimitrov , r a zuker , m prediction of hybridization and melting for double stranded nucleic acids biophys j , , abstract full text pdf santalucia , jr , j a unified view of polymer , dumbbell , and oligonucleotide dna nearest neighbor thermodynamics proc natl acad sci usa , , abstract full text pdf walter , a e , turner , d h , kim , j , lyttle , m h , m ller , p , mathews , d h zuker , m coaxial stacking of helixes enhances binding of oligoribonucleotides and improves predictions of rna folding proc natl acad sci usa , , abstract full text pdf
