aa is often referred to as a program of action in fact , i just finished a post about this topic over at the second road recovery from alcoholism definitely requires action putting down the drink was n't enough for me , i needed to recover physically , emotionally and spiritually i needed to learn a new way to live in this way , i think recovery from alcoholism and recovery from mental illness are very similar my recovery from mental illness also requires ongoing action without taking action to heal , i cannot hope to recover physically , emotionally or spiritually from devastating depression sitting around waiting for health to happen is unrealistic , yet do n't some of us expect that ? i did after all , my illness came on without warning or explanation , why should n't i expect it to go away similarly ? i'm sure that 's what i thought during the early years of my illness i did n't take action i was so wrapped up in the unfairness of my lot , i could n't move forward i felt like shit i had no energy i lost my spouse , my job , my house all because of this illness i wanted to die , and all i could do was focus on wanting to die the more i focused on my pain , the more painful my life got this constant misery focus is a trap which i think may be unique to mental illness we , of the non hallmark illnesses , must face constant stigma , shame and discrimination not encountered by those with hotdish friendly diseases huh , you say ? when your depression symptoms were most debilitating , did the church ladies bring you a casserole and jello ? i did n't think so our experience , our suffering is not only misunderstood by friends and relatives , it is downright invalidated hence , we repeat and reiterate how badly we feel , how much life hurts , in hopes that someone will get it worse yet , i internalized the invalidation sometimes still do i think my misery focus may , at times , have been an attempt to convince myself that , yes , i really was sick at some point , perhaps as a result of dbt training , i realized focusing on my pain was n't going to help me heal perhaps it happened when i stopped caring who believed and who did n't , although that 's still only the case on my best days or maybe it was because i had finally surrounded myself with a stable , supportive , and caring treatment team who validated my experience validation and hotdish is something people with cancer , ms , or heart disease get almost immediately , whereas it took me years to get a nonjudgmental , professional team in place their validation and support freed me to focus on recovery and healing i still have n't received a hotdish , though by removing the need to convince them of my pain , my treatment team allowed me to focus on therapeutic action instead perhaps if we know the people around us believe we are really sick , getting well is not so daunting i mean , if we are stuck in the trap of proving our misery , are n't we less likely to take actions which may lessen our misery ? are we scared that if we improve before anyone believes we were sick , we might hear , i told you so , from the non supportive , non believers ? i do n't know it 's just a spontaneous thought i had , and i realize it may be a prickly thought for some readers i assure you , though , i am not saying that we do n't get well on purpose ! not at all ! for me , just me , it makes sense that i began taking more positive action once i had the support and validation of the people around me and recovery requires action without action i cannot maintain my health today my depression is not gone , but it is certainly more stable than in years past however , if i stop taking the actions if i stop taking my meds , getting exercise and sleep , eating well , and finding meaning in every day if i stop doing those therapeutic things , i am sure my tenuous grasp on stability will fall quickly away recovery , for me , requires action
