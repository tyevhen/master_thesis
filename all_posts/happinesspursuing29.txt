i m not sure what set me off in this direction in my thinking but here i am , wondering if i have aspergers first , an update on life as i know it things have been going poorly the economy hit me hard and one of my two sources of income crumbled away my other source , writing , is actually doing very well i signed a book deal my first in october and other gigs continue to come in even without my seeking them out i m making less than i was , which wasn t much , but i m happier in this work so , i should be happy overall but we are talking about depression , right ? my social world continues to shrink and , although i don t like social situations in the least , i can tell that the almost complete lack of them since i started working at home is taking a heavy toll on my overall emotional well being i ve considered spending two or three mornings a week working in a coffee house i wouldn t have to deal with anyone but just being out and among others might help my drinking has increased i m not ready to say it s a problem yet but it s worth mentioning depression has wrapped itself completely around me i ve succumbed to it in recent months and have found an odd comfort in the resignation i haven t taken st john s wort since the summer on to aspergers like i said , i m not sure what sent my mind down this path but i ve been thinking about my severe social dislike and awkwardness and wondering if this might have something to do with mild autism , which is an oversimplified way to describe aspergers check out the wikipedia entry on aspergers if you re unfamiliar with this condition and really want to know i have most of the symptoms some points of my life that seem to really mesh well the speech thing my mom tells me that i was a very late talker she doesn t remember my first word because i just started talking in complete sentences one day i ve always thought that was odd wouldn t one remember their baby s first word or utterance regardless ? also , in elementary school i used to go to speech therapy i don t remember the specific problem i actually forgot about it until college when suddenly one day the memory came flooding back when i met the son of the woman who was my speech teacher weird , right ? social situations i ve beat that one to death that s a definite check in the yes column misunderstanding other s nonverbal communication check and so on a few points where i don t seem to fit the condition i think i m a pretty good abstract thinker my professional writing is nonfiction but i have written fiction in the past and greatly enjoyed it i also like reading fiction and think that i m pretty good at picking up on the subtext however , having a degree in english literature could have given me the training to approach this formulaically lack of empathy this is the biggest reason that would make me question my having aspergers i think that i am hyper aware of other people around me and their reactions to what i say i often will stop mid sentence because the slightest change in my listeners expression people do think that i have an odd speech pattern and i do tend to go on obsessively about a few topics , both aspects of aspergers so , i took the autism spectrum quotient test this morning and scored a which is rated as above average i always feel like i m screwing up these self administered tests , though i d just spent an hour or so reading about aspergers so i recognized the symptoms behind the questions i realized that i was overcompensating and trying to not be to eager with a yes , yes , that s me exactly sort of response so did i drive my real score down ? who knows what will i do with this new information ? i have no idea probably nothing however , it does make me feel even more justified in refusing the social anxiety medication that was prescribed to me years ago it might have treated a symptom but not the problem if i do indeed have aspergers
