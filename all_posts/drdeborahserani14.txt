as a psychologist who specializes in working with adults and children , i d tell you the most important issue in psychotherapy is how you approach your treatment in clinical terms this is called treatment adherence , but it can also be known as consistency treatment adherence , the state of your acceptance and follow through with treatment recommended by your healthcare professional , is critical to recovery but it 's even more important to maintain well being consistency doesn t just mean going to psychotherapy or taking your medication consistency means making every psychotherapy appointment being on time for sessions , and making sure you don t skip treatment because you want to go to the beach or just don t feel like talking consistency means taking your medication every day at the same time , with the same dose consistency means making sure you get refills in time so there s no break or gap in your medication regime consistency means you aim to eat well , sleep well and exercise the single biggest issue i see as doctor treating depression is non adherence how children and adults become too casual in their commitment to treatment for many , once they begin to feel a bit better , they stop coming to sessions , or decide not to take medication anymore the problem here is that while their symptoms have improved , the mood disorder is not at a management level and as such , relapse occurs the best way to think about being consistent with your treatment plan begins with aiming for managing your illness , not managing your symptoms when you manage your symptoms , you are only taking care of the surface issues managing your illness takes more commitment , but it 's so worth it
