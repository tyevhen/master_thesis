i'm enjoying my first cup of coffee , as i sit here in my living room one hour prior to my final long run , only miles , before next sunday 's marathon it 's taper time i had a very good week of training i feel good i think i'm as ready as i 'll ever be tapering is sometimes fun , sometimes stressful it 's nice to decrease mileage and intensity after training hard for so long but it 's also a time full of worries have i done enough ? did i do too much ? am i getting enough rest ? these and other questions push me to tweak my training at the last minute , a useless proposition tapering requires trust in the process and faith in that i 've done what i could interestingly , i'm tapering at work right now , too on monday i 'll begin my second to last week at my current position and guess what ? i'm finding tapering at work to be a nice , yet stressful time as i tell my patients i'm leaving , i'm receiving more than my fair share of love , respect , and compliments i have a lot of sweet patients on my caseload right now , and i 'll miss them but out of that love and respect arise more questions in my brain am i doing the right thing ? should i be staying where i'm at ? what if the new position is more stressful than i can handle ? these and other questions leave me wondering the reality is i do n't know what will happen in either situation whether it 's an upcoming marathon or an impending employment change , i have no control over the future in both cases my only job is to prepare as best i can and that 's where i need to keep my focus today preparation if i can stay focused on preparation , i can enjoy more and worry less about these tapers everything will work out i have faith in that
