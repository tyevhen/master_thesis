i 've had a better day to day but i still feel so low my confidence has had a major knock as it all relied on work and my success at work now i know that those who built my confidence did so on a wonky foundation i am not good , at least not as good as anyone else in the office they have been so patronising saying yes you are good , just not as good as me and not as good as anyone else because they are just better so where does that leave me ! ! ! ! i 've had friends round this afternoon , we went for dinner one of my friends stayed a bit longer and we went for a drink i talked a bit and again it is helping me get things back in perspective i took extra quetiapine last night to help me sleep i do not like the dizzy sensation it gives me i'm staying completely off alcohol for the time being i will take extra quetiapine again tonight just to make sure i sleep when i woke up this morning my limbs were so heavy but today my mind has rested tomorrow i am going to the gym and in the evening i am going o a pub quiz with a friend i am still trying to keep busy and get things back into perspective work sucks and i am angry at some people i guess it is better i am hating them than hating myself i like my job and other colleagues just a few have been arseholes
