i have begun my driving journey once again i passed my theory few days ago and i 've already had a few driving refresher lessons ! those of you who have been following my blog will know that i had to stop my driving lessons due to my anxiety in fact , one of my worst mental health episodes occurred just before a driving lesson and that was the last i ever saw of my driving instructors car although , i find driving fun and have no problem driving in my dad 's car , the lessons seem to affect me differently nevertheless , this summer i plan to pass my driving test as i only need a few refresher lessons and have already booked my driving test ! i used to be jealous at all of the people that have passed their test at age however that does n't affect me anymore as time has moved on , i 've begun to understand my journey and am beginning to find peace i finally feel ready to take on one of my biggest anxiety triggers so , by the time i get back to university in september , i should have a licence to drive fingers crossed ! i hope to keep you all updated on a regular basis with my driving journey speak soon and here 's hoping it all goes well ! amy xx
