yesterday i wrote about the stigma and derogatory labels attached to people with mental illness as a speaker for the national alliance on mental illness , i attempt to dispel that stigma the extensive list of labels , put downs , and untruths i included in yesterday 's post comes straight out of the mouths of my audiences we ask for those labels as part of a stigma busting exercise the junior high kids , especially , love yelling them out but audience members of all ages recognize , use and understand them similarly , each audience shifts uncomfortably when asked to vocalize derogatory terms for people with other illnesses like liver disease , cancer , or diabetes someone in the younger crowd usually yells something like , you ca n't call those people names that 's not nice i love it i decided to come out as a person with mental illness shortly after being fired see it all started when during the long process of attempting to reclaim my job , suing , arbitration , and settlement , i developed an awareness of unfairness i realized if this could happen to me , an educated healthcare professional working at a hospital , it was likely happening to many others in every walk of life ! i was lucky i had my education and was years into my second career when my illness struck many of us with this brain disease are struck in our developmental prime , late high school or early college years if i could be fired from a professional healthcare position , what was happening to my compatriots who were still working their way up ? and , even more scary , what could they do about it ? did they know they could do anything about it ? or did the loss of their educational and or financial foundation just pile on to the loss of their emotional foundation , effectively pushing them yet further down throw into the mix the family 's confusion and perhaps shame on and on and on i had to come out i was lucky i was an educated mental health professional i knew a bit about the law i knew there were resources to find any information i did n't know i was motivated by unfairness and though my spouse jumped ship , i had a big mouth and was able to find community support i had paid into a disability plan while working , and initially those benefits paid my bills i could focus on getting treatment , getting well , and fighting the discrimination i was fortunate do n't get me wrong it absolutely sucked ! i would prefer never to have gone through it and while i won my suit , the amount was not great it did n't take long for that amount to disappear healthcare costs are astronomical when you do n't have health insurance ! but , i won they were wrong i did n't roll over and go away instead , i was motivated to share my experience , educate , support and fight for others and i have been fortunate to have the opportunity to do this
