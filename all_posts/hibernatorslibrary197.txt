the tide , by anthony j melchiorri , narrated by ryan kennard burke captain dominic holland dom is head of a covert operations team which investigates bioterrorism as he and his team check out some suspicious activity on what was believed to be an abandoned oil rig , bone armored mutant men begin to wash up on shores of countries around the world soon , citizens become crazed brutally attacking and devouring people dom 's team rushes to find a cure to the bioweapon , as civilization crashes around them i found this book in the new releases in audible and thought i 'd try it out the genre is basically bioweapon zombie apocalypse , but the zombies are n't actually zombies they are living humans who develop bony armor around their bodies and get brain activation of unthinking violence it was a fast paced , high action book the science was very reasonable clearly melchiorri did his research which i like to see in biotech books otherwise i tend to roll my eyes and criticize every little mistake yes , the race for a cure moved along much too fast to be realistic , but that 's the nature of the genre , not a problem with melchiorri 's writing nobody wants to read a book with the pacing of real life , after all i think this book will be quite enjoyable to anyone who likes biotech apocalypse thrillers , especially those who enjoyed jonathan maberry 's patient zero but beware , it is the first in a series , and the story just cuts off at the end there 's not a satisfying conclusion luckily , melchiorri is releasing the second one hot on the heels of the first , so this may not be an issue for many readers i decided to give this book four stars despite the fact that there was n't a satisfying ending the science was excellent and it was just what a biotech thriller should be
