i thought today i might illustrate how a rant can become a poem normally yesterday 's experiment would have been reformed into something more resembling a poem in what is called a first draft a first draft includes revisions , revisions which will likely be revised later in second and third drafts the difficulty is in not squeezing the original feeling of a poem into a straitjacket so tight it fails to move the reader , losing all spontaneity and connection a technically great poem is just that technically great , but essentially forgettable if all the juice has been squeezed out of it i have been especially guilty of over revising in the past , though usually a poem that suffers that fate never had much of a future anyway you can turn a sow 's ear into a silk purse if you try hard enough , but the sow 's ear is much more interesting so here 's a first draft rapunzel i war is fractious , filled with dirty bombs we sell these bombs imagine ! do not be deceived , god is not mocked whatever a man sows , he shall also reap we sow global discord in the name of peace , praise slaughter in the name of stability we kill the innocent because we cannot find the guilty how elusive our enemies have proven ! wolves hidden in sniper s robes tragedy is loosed upon the world like a virus and more than birds are dying and will die ii i m sorry to say it , but the world trade center ? good target ! as if we owned the world ! it is this hubris that the world hates , the blindness of a consumer driven culture of anti culture , a whore 's bed of merchandise there is no hegemony , wolfowitz the dollar 's fallen long live the yen ! come down , american , come down , rapunzel your hair is tangled with barbwire your gown is made of kevlar apes swing on your braid the impotent congress nods they will pull us out by the roots , stain the tower with the blood of scalps thine in truth and protest , ce essentially kilorat neutral but still feeling sketchy underneath
