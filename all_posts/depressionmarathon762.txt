it 's almost pm on sunday night , and i'm finally sitting down ! i had a class yesterday all day about miles away today , i worked in between i watched my twins look terrible and get knocked out of the playoffs tonight , i ran a mile tempo run on some pretty dead legs before heading to my least favorite place to spend money the grocery store i'm finally home now , but i 've got little else to say i'm tired i'm hungry i need to get ready for work tomorrow , and my body is screaming for bed i promise i 'll be more verbose once i'm rested good night
