the conversion experience is an important aspect of belief systems due to one cataclysmic event , a person sees the light and is inalterably changed as a rule , this epiphanic moment happens suddenly , converting the individual from a suffering , despairing human being into someone who has found peace and salvation it is a seemingly magical experience that appears to happen without rhyme or reason many of my patients have talked about their earlier conversions things must be going badly this is the sine qua nonfor the conversion experience further , the difficulties must have endured for some time before the defense system begins to crumble the individual 's current situation , compounded with past trauma , becomes more than the person can handle suddenly there is breakdown and conversion i recall how one patient put it i was broke , divorced and alone for some time one day , sitting in the park alone at dusk , i felt something grab me and i screamed out all to myself , 'i ve been saved ! ' what i discovered later in therapy was that i had been saved from a feeling that i was never saved , that my parents let me drown in my misery without so much as batting an eye they did nothing to help me , turned me out at the age of because i did n't behave , and let me flounder in life through drugs and alcohol without once reaching out to help naked before this neglect , unloved , alone , she fled into the arms of the mystical , where she no longer felt alone or unloved now that she had been saved , she no longer had to feel that there was no one to save her from her childhood hell she now had renewed hope , the same hope she had lost very early in her life this was the essence of her conversion she had converted hopelessness into hope therein lies the paradigm for the conversion experience i call it a primal crisis it usually occurs to people when they are in enormous pain or on the brink of it it is really the snapping point and it occurs when the person can no longer defend there 's nothing else left for her to do but to be saved by god very often , when my patients are on the verge of tremendous feelings , particularly the feelings that predate verbal abilities , they begin to shake and tremble enormously they thrash and writhe as the force of the pain almost lifts them off the ground one patient , while convulsing violently , screamed out that she felt a force shaking her finally she cried , i ve been saved , i ve been saved ! this occurred during a personal crisis , a period of utmost despair and hopelessness for weeks she had been seriously contemplating suicide finally , her conversion experience told why she was suffering so much by being born again , she had been saved saved from the discovery that she had absolutely no one in her life , not now , not ever her rebirth spared her the profound hopelessness that comes with the realization that she was utterly alone in an indifferent universe , that no one loved her why do people tremble and shake while undergoing religious conversion ? it 's really a very short leap from the feeling fueling these convulsions to sensing a new , magical , benevolent force that controls one 's destiny it is childhood pain converted to a belief in childhood magic , the belief that anything is now possible the form does n't matter jesus , buddha , allah , pyramid power , communication with an omniscient seer from centuries past one is now in another realm , another universe what we see in the conversion experience is how pliable feelings are how easily they are turned into ideas and how those ideas have the strength of feeling this process is not as freakish as one might imagine , since it aids in survival
