benedict carey writes about surgical treatments for obsessive compulsive disorder in yesterday 's new york times in surgery for mental ills offers both hope and risks , in one procedure , called a cingulotomy , doctors drill into the skull and thread wires into an area called the anterior cingulate there they pinpoint and destroy pinches of tissue that lie along a circuit in each hemisphere that connects deeper , emotional centers of the brain to areas of the frontal cortex , where conscious planning is centered this circuit appears to be hyperactive in people with severe o c d , and imaging studies suggest that the surgery quiets that activity in another operation , called a capsulotomy , surgeons go deeper , into an area called the internal capsule , and burn out spots in a circuit also thought to be overactive an altogether different approach is called deep brain stimulation , or d b s , in which surgeons sink wires into the brain but leave them in place a pacemaker like device sends a current to the electrodes , apparently interfering with circuits thought to be hyperactive in people with obsessive compulsive disorder and also those with severe depression the current can be turned up , down or off , so deep brain stimulation is adjustable and , to some extent , reversible in yet another technique , doctors place the patient in an m r i like machine that sends beams of radiation into the skull the beams pass through the brain without causing damage , except at the point where they converge there they burn out spots of tissue from o c d related circuits , with similar effects as the other operations carey goes on to talk about the rigorous screening , the risks of surgery , and tells stories of both good and bad outcomes
