i guess i should have expected it wacky thinking for more than one week could n't lead to anything but i should have expected it 's arrival maybe i wished for a different outcome , but no it 's setting in it 's here hopelessness hopeless i hate the word i hate the feeling yet here i sit ready for work with tears in my eyes feeling heavier and heavier maybe the stupid car , which is really no big deal , was the straw that broke through and released it maybe the thinking finally wore me out i fought it and fought it , but eventually well , maybe i 've reached my limit no matter the cause i'm feeling heavy i'm feeling hopeless another foe in this wide world of mental treachery , i will fight it , too
