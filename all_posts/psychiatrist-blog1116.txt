here 's an article about a private health insurer and how they dealt with an out of network referral i'm still trying to figure out how you know what you 're getting with health insurance some of it sounds like the coverage is great , but when a patient needs a service or goes to get a medicine , it 's not covered the one good thing about hmo 's is that there is no pretense you know you 're not getting out of network care , you know the formularies are limited this is from the wife of a cancer patient and the struggles they had getting the care http seattletimes nwsource com html opinion harrop html
