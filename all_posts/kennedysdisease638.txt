over the last few years , my fingers and hands have become an issue my grip isn t as good and i find that i drop things more often , or cannot grip things as well the problem becomes more serious as the temperatures drop i tried several ways to improve my grip and use of the fingers , but nothing really worked until i exercised my hands and fingers every day prior to this , i exercised the hands and fingers every other day within hours , i noticed some soreness and , within hours , i experienced problems again since i began a routine of daily exercises , i no longer experience the soreness also , i don t have the fall off in strength that i used to experience my hands and fingers operate better and are stronger my grip has also improved after moving to the daily routine , i have modified several of the exercises based upon my experiences do what works for you photo kr jpg by krosseel
