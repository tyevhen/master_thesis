i'm sitting in my living room watching the carol burnett show my friend loaned me the complete set , so i 've got lots of laughter ahead that 's good because otherwise things are moving along slowly here my hip is healing slowly had i not ruptured one of the quad tendons , i 'd be much further along than i am , and that 's frustrating nevertheless i am healing i'm doing what i can to stay active my surgeon told me not to do anything that hurts , so i 've had limited exercise options fortunately i can walk without pain in fact , jet and i just came in from a one hour walk it was a beautiful , sunny , brisk day for a walk i'm grateful i 've healed enough to allow me to walk at this point in time my mood remains okay despite not being able to run right now getting outside to walk on these beautiful days helps the more sunshine i can get the better i'm a little worried about the shorter days coming up , but if i can keep moving i'm hopeful i will stave off any depression episodes laughing at carol burnett helps , too i'm grateful my mood remains good keep moving , my friends
