i 've not got much to report things are going well i noticed a slight dip in my mood early this week , following my dnf over the weekend , but i was able to right myself relatively quickly i just had to let go of the disappointment and focus on what my reader , maggie , mentioned in her helpful comment dnf means did not fail i like that thanks maggie i'm off to the lake again this weekend it 's supposed to be nice , and of course i'm looking forward to seeing d ! i'm hoping to run miles with d and his son on saturday his son is training for his first marathon , which unfortunately is the same weekend as my next marathon , so d will be far away with his son on that day as he should be i 've had a refreshingly good week of training so far it will be nice to run through the quiet woods , with someone whose company i enjoy , to finish off the week tomorrow nothing more to report from here have a safe , enjoyable , healthy holiday weekend !
