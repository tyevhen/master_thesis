have you ever watched a video of yourself and realized you have some mannerism you never knew about , like some stupid look on your face whenever you 're listening to people or an annoying vocal pattern or something ? and then you 're like , oh my gosh do i do that ? all the time ? and no one else really cares but you 're about ready to go put your head in a paper bag and crawl under your back porch and never come out to spare humanity the blight of whatever tiny defect you just found out about or maybe a friend told you , do you know that you do such and such a thing a lot ? but you were completely clueless and now you 're worried that 's all people notice when they see you or you are washing your hands in the bathroom after a meal and you 're like , shoot how long has that spinach been covering my entire front tooth who saw this and how long did they laugh after i left i'm not typically a self conscious person , but the last couple days i 've found myself feeling quite nit picky with myself , noticing little things that i do when i talk or how stuff tends to get stuck in my not quite straight teeth , etc and feeling very anxious about it i started to imagine how people must see me and wonder if people judge me or if i 've been barred from opportunities because of these minor quirks maybe it makes me annoying to listen to when i talk maybe i look really stupid i started to make action plans to try and rectify the problems i would make a more conscious effort to clean my teeth after meals after all , what if i one day went on a date and got stuff stuck in my teeth ? ? i would practice keeping my mouth closed when i was n't talking so it would n't just hang open blah blah blah it was exhausting just obsessing about it for the ten minutes before i gave up and decided it did n't matter that much i ca n't imagine how awful it must be to have a disorder where you obsess about these things all the time it saps the happiness and life out of you i'm sure i 'll see some video of myself in a year or two and start freaking out again about some aspect of myself and if i ever get asked on a date i probably will end up with broccoli in my teeth but i like to think that a date would be far more distracted by my witty banter , sagely wisdom , and intimate knowledge of the nuances of early american teaware designs than by a stupid green speck in my mouth i guess i realized that it 's better to have a dumb haircut or wonky eyebrow than an abusive personality , selfish heart , or unkind spirit even if there are some things about my outward appearance that do n't live up to the typical beauty standards or even that are ugly to others , i would rather be less attractive than be someone who hurts others , ruins lives , kills , or is filled with anger and hate i know some people 's insecurity ca n't be cured just by simple words like that , but if you 're like me and occasionally start nit picking yourself and feeling lousy , i hope this gives a bit of perspective , as it did for me stay strong , friends you 're all beautiful
