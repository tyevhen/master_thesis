coming out as gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgender can be a challenging process for people who have considered themselves to be heterosexual for most of their lives it can be even more challenging and confusing if you 're already in a heterosexual marriage coming out as a gay person while you 're in a heterosexual marriage the following composite vignette , with all identifying information changed to protect confidentiality , illustrates some of the challenges as well as hope and new possibilities for someone who came out while in a heterosexual marriage martin martin and his wife , sally , were married for years they mutually decided not to have children before they got married before they got married , martin told sally that he had a few sexual encounters with men while he was in college but he told her that these were just part of his youthful explorations as a young college student , and he definitely considered himself to be heterosexual sally thought of herself as an open mind person , and she had no doubt in her mind that martin was heterosexual she believed martin when he told her that he had no sexual interest in men after years of marriage , their sex life had waned , it was never very passionate , but neither of them minded martin often came home so exhausted from work that he usually fell asleep before sally they spent their weekends either socializing with friends or family or going out together to one of their favorite museums , restaurants or to the theatre overall , they were both happy in their marriage until martin met paul , a new business client at work paul was a very handsome out gay man who was well liked by his business associates for his talent in business as well as his outgoing personality martin 's boss considered paul 's company to be an important account , and he wanted martin to make paul 's company a priority as a result , martin was expected to take paul out from time to time to work on projects martin felt comfortable with paul it did n't matter to martin that paul was gay he enjoyed working with him and enjoyed his company after a few dinners and over more than a few drinks , paul asked martin if he had ever been sexual with a man when martin looked uncomfortable , paul apologized and said , i'm sorry i hope you do n't mind my saying this , but when i first met you , i was sure you were gay martin told paul that he was happily married to sally , and he definitely considered himself to be heterosexual martin made light of the paul 's comment , and then he tactfully changed the subject but , as he drove home , martin was shaken by paul 's comment he was n't as much offended by his remark as he was confused he wondered what paul might have seen in him to make him think he was gay when he mentioned paul 's remark to sally , they both laughed about it but martin found it difficult to fall asleep that night , and he could n't stop thinking about it for days when it was time for martin to meet paul again for dinner , martin felt anxious but he also realized that he was looking forward to seeing paul this made him feel uncomfortable he was n't sure what this was all about he knew that he had always enjoyed paul 's company in the past , but there was something different about this he tried to invite one of his other colleagues to the dinner , but no one was available on such short notice , so he had to see paul on his own he thought of canceling the dinner , but he knew his boss would n't like this , so he met paul for dinner they talked about the business project , which had been going well all the while , it was beginning to dawn on martin that he was physically attracted to paul he rationalized to himself that paul was a very handsome and charming man , so most people , whether they were gay or heterosexual , would find him attractive but it bothered him that he felt this way after they finished talking about work , paul mentioned that he was in a long term relationship with his partner , tom he explained that he and tom were in an open relationship they considered themselves to be primary to each other , but they each saw other men from time to time , mostly for sexual encounters martin talked to paul about his relationship with sally , but all the while he felt distracted and confused about his growing attraction to paul after a few drinks , paul placed his hand gently on martin 's hand martin did n't move his hand away he was as surprised by paul 's gesture as well as his own reaction to it by the end of the evening , martin , who had drank quite a bit , went back with paul to his hotel room and they had passionate sex it was the most exciting sex he ever had martin was deeply troubled by his sexual encounter with paul he told himself that he loved his wife , he was n't gay but , for some unknown reason , he was very drawn to paul he told himself it was something in particular about paul he rationalized that he had much too much to drink that night and he was n't thinking clearly but he had to admit that he enjoyed having sex with paul , and this bothered him a lot when he met paul for dinner the next time , he refused to drink he also told paul that he made a terrible mistake by going back to his hotel with him that he was a happily married man , he was n't gay , and he did n't want to cheat on his wife but by the end of the evening , martin allowed himself to be seduced again and he went back to paul 's hotel this was the beginning of martin 's sexual affair with paul whenever he thought about his wife , martin felt deeply ashamed he did n't want to hurt her , and he did n't want to leave her he especially did n't want to think of himself as a gay man he did n't even want to think of himself as being bisexual he told paul that he did n't understand what was happening to him but he had to admit to himself that having sex with paul was the most exciting sex he had ever had in his life he told paul that he did n't want to put any labels on what they were doing no commitments no promises after a few months of getting together with paul nearly every day , martin was becoming increasingly unhappy and ashamed he did n't like that he was leading a secret life and lying to sally his sex life with sally had come to a complete halt he kept telling her that he was too tired to have sex , and she did n't seem to suspect anything he felt highly conflicted about what he was doing each time he told himself and paul that he would n't continue with the affair , he broke his own promise to himself when martin found himself spiraling into a depression , he contacted a therapist who specialized in working with men who considered themselves heterosexual but who were sexually involved with gay men it was n't an easy decision , but he knew he needed to do something he could n't keep leading a double life over time in therapy , martin was able to accept that he really preferred men he realized that his sexual attraction to paul was not just about paul it was about all men he also realized that his sexual encounters in college frightened and confused him , which caused him to deny his own feelings for men he still loved sally , but he knew he could n't keep living a lie soon after that , martin came out to sally he told her about the affair he was having with paul sally was very shocked and upset they both cried after the initial shock , sally was remarkably understanding she was hurt and angry that martin cheated on her , but she knew she needed to let him go she loved him enough that she wanted him to be happy martin joined a coming out group for men in heterosexual marriages he found a lot of support in the group he also heard stories that were very similar to his own he learned that coming out would be a process , and he had to take it one day at a time over time , martin accepted that he preferred men he and paul ended their affair , and martin met a man online that he fell in love with he continued to face challenges in terms of coming out to friends , relatives , and colleagues , but these challenges were easier to face with the support of his therapy and his support group the challenges of coming out the vignette above is one of many different scenarios that people face when they are coming out while in a heterosexual marriage some people continue in their heterosexual marriage and never fully admit that they are gay or bisexual , not even to themselves they live painful , compartmentalized lives because they ca n't come to terms with their sexual orientation other people tell themselves , as martin did , that they 're really not gay it 's just something in a particular person that they 're drawn to others have gay affairs all their lives while remaining in a heterosexual marriage they live double lives , ashamed and angry with themselves , always fearing that they 'll get caught living in a limbo state can be very painful only you can decide what your
