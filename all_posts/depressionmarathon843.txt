it 's hard to have a restful day when i'm so anxious about tomorrow 's triathlon i spent the morning volunteering at the first big race of the season here it was a k which i usually run , but for obvious reasons did n't run this year it was hard to sit and watch it was also surprisingly anxiety provoking to watch the start of the race all of a sudden i pictured myself in the pool at tomorrow 's start , and i just about began hyperventilating ! how silly ! i just had to laugh at myself and go back to my volunteer position at the food table after the race i came home and napped for a very short time not long enough then i took puck swimming again he just loves chasing that ball , even though he was shivering once we finished my friend taylor is outside finishing my deck right now i 'll post a picture when it 's finished it 's just lovely ! i'm having dinner with my friends bill and cindy i try to eat the same thing before all my big races , and believe it or not , that thing is the baker 's square chicken quesadilla what can i say ? it worked once , then it worked again , and now it 's the routine ! i 've already started putting my stuff together for tomorrow of course , i'm worried i 'll forget something important i probably wo n't my friend renee is going to be my one fan and take pictures for me she 's a runner extraordinaire and a fellow blogger check her out at renee 's ramblings if i do n't look too horrible , i may even post some of her shots hey , i just thought of one positive aspect of being so anxious ! i 've not had any time to freak out about starting a new job on monday ! yet wish me luck !
