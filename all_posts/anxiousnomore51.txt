i have always been a fan of rss feeds and have offered ways to subscribe to the reality of anxiety through feed readers and email i 've also attached links at the bottom of each post for stumbleupon , technorati , digg , del icio us , and my yahoo ! however , there are many people that use other popular methods of tracking their favorite blogs such as twitter , facebook , and blogger 's followers widget all are methods of sharing information and i want you to be able to access the reality of anxiety however is best for you , so i have added functionality that will allow you to do just that you will notice share buttons at the beginning of each post for facebook and twitter , and a followers widget along the sidebar if it starts to get too crowded i will remove the less used ones , but i think i 've spaced them out okay let me know if you like the updates , or if its all just too confusing ! share and read on ! p s there may be some issues since i am new to these for instance the tweet button on each post defaults to one not sure why , still trying to figure it out if you have any problems using the new features just let me know if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like roa now on facebook ! what is rss ? how to stay up to date with the reality of my redeeming moment on facebook check out the new discussion forum linkwithin
