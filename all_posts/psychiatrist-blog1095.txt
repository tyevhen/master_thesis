in maryland , the issue of patient charts and confidentiality is a heated topic it 's even made it to the state legislature i do n't write the most exciting of notes the first time i meet with a patient , i take a full and detailed history and i write the whole time , so my notes essentially say what patient says , ending with a mental status examine , then my impression , diagnosis , and a brief treatment plan after that , i do n't take notes during the session and i do n't generally write about the detailed content of therapy sessions i may leave it as patient talked about activities and family matters if i change a medication , i say why , especially if it would n't be obvious if i do anything risky or unconventional , i write about why i'm choosing to do this , why other options are n't sufficient , and that i 've discussed it with the patient if i'm worried about someone , i may discuss what measures i 've taken to insure their safety i do n't write process notes about the psychotherapy , i do n't put in very personal information that is n't directly related to treatment decisions i view the chart as a legal document and as a clinical reference if the patient tells me years later that some medication worked great , i can look up why we stopped a medication that worked great okay , so confidentiality no one asks for my notes rare requests for information from physicians , but a treatment summary does a much better job no patient has ever asked to see my chart and if they did , i do n't imagine it would be a problem or a very interesting read what do other shrinks write about ?
