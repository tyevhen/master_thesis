in my prior post , i discussed creating and maintaining healthy personal boundaries in intimate relationships in this post , i would like to focus on one aspect of this challenge codependence , how it affects relationships , and what can be done to overcome codependence what is codependence ? originally , in the late s , the concept of codependence was developed in the recovery movement alcoholics anonymous it was called co alcoholism it was recognized that not only did the alcoholic in the family have problems , but sometimes the partner of the alcoholic engaged in certain dysfunctional behaviors in response to the alcoholic during the s , the term changed from co alcoholism to codependence the change in terms recognized that these dynamics occur in dysfunctional families whether or not there is alcohol or drugs involved relationships overcoming codependence codependence occurs when one partner takes responsibility for the feelings or actions of the other partner in order to avoid dealing with his or her own feelings this is called enabling behavior because it enables not in a good way the other partner to avoid taking responsibility for his or her own behavior or feelings and it maintains the status quo in the family the enabling partner becomes overly involved and over functions for the other partner the enabling partner also tries to fix or rescue the other partner to the point of ignoring his or her own needs the reason why enabling partners engage in this behavior , which is often unconscious , is to take the focus off their uncomfortable feelings if they 're focused primarily on their partners , they do n't have to think about or deal with their own feelings please note that when i'm discussing these dynamics , i'm talking about two adult able bodied people where each person is capable of handling their own problems i'm not talking about taking care of children , the disabled or taking care of the elderly how can you recognize the signs of codependence ? what are the signs of codependence ? ask yourself do you have a compelling need to be needed in your relationship ? i'm not talking about the need that most people have to feel useful and valued i'm talking about a strong urge to have your partner emotionally dependent upon you do you have a tendency to be the rock for your family and friends ? does everyone come to you with their problems and expect you to resolve them ? is there little give and take in your relationships so that you tend to be the one bailing people out or over functioning for them in some way , but others are rarely helping you either because they ca n't or you wo n't let them ? do you dislike being alone ? do you need to have someone around most of the time because you feel too uncomfortable being by yourself ? do you engage in people pleasing ? is it hard for you to say no even when saying yes will come at a big expense to you either emotionally , physically , financially or spiritually ? do you attract people who tend to get themselves into jams where you 're the one who is helping them most of the time ? think about your partner , family , friends does this seem to be the pattern with people around you ? do you tend to be the caregiver with your partner and in your other close relationships ? do you try to create dependencies with people close to you when the relationships do n't start out that way ? do you go overboard by constantly offering to do things for these able bodied adults that they can do for themselves ? do you make up excuses for your partner so that your partner does n't have to take responsibility for his or her own behavior ? for instance , if your partner stayed up late one night either watching tv or drinking or drugging , are you the one who calls your partner 's employer to make up excuses for your partner 's lateness problem or absences ? do you tend to put your partner 's or others' needs first most of the time so that your own needs go unmet ? if you answered yes to two or more of these questions , most likely , you have a problem with codependence what are the consequences of codependence ? what are the consequences of codependence ? often , codependent behavior causes serious problems the enabling partner has a need , either conscious or unconscious , to control the relationship so that what appears on the surface to be helping behavior is often a need to have control this usually causes resentment because most people do n't want to be controlled the enabling partner , in turns , feels resentment because he or she feels unappreciated after all , from his or her point of view , this behavior is meant to stabilize the relationship the consequences for enabling partners can be serious because they 're not taking care of their needs maybe they 're neglecting their health or neglecting themselves emotionally or neglecting themselves in other ways this all comes at a price what can you do to overcome codependence ? what can you do to overcome codependence ? the first step is to become aware of your behavior and the problems that it is causing you personally and for your relationship the second step is to admit that you have a problem without pointing fingers at your partner or anyone else just you the next step is to take action to change your behavior in order to bring about personal changes in yourself and to change the dynamics in your relationship take care of yourself if you 've ever flown on a plane and you 've heard the flight attendant 's instructions , you know that , in case of an emergency , you need to put the oxygen mask on yourself first before you put it on anyone else why is this ? because if you do n't do this for yourself first , you wo n't be able to do it for anyone else the same applies in your everyday relationships this may be a challenge because it 's a new way of thinking and behaving it will take practice of course , this does n't mean that you go to the other extreme and ignore or neglect your relationships balance is the key ask yourself what am i avoiding in myself when i place most of my focus on other people 's feelings and behaviors ? at first , you might only have a vague sense , especially if you 've been in the habit of primarily focusing on others over time , as you focus more on yourself and your own feelings , you might come to experience yourself in a deeper way develop healthy personal boundaries before you say yes to something that will be at your expense , think about it if you know deep down that it will be too uncomfortable or too much of a sacrifice for you , learn to say no in a tactful way maintain balance in your relationships there should be a healthy give and take in your relationships talk to your partner in a tactful way about changing the dynamics between you hopefully , he or she will be supportive but expect that you might get some push back from your partner and you might need to reinforce this new behavior if your partner is drinking excessively or using drugs or gambling , rather than trying to fix or rescue a partner who might not be ready for help , you might really benefit from going to al anon , nar anon or gam a non support groups in your area you 'll find support from others who are dealing with the same problems usually , there are some people who were where you are now and who have learned to overcome many aspects of the same problems that you 're struggling with now they can share their hope and strength with you overcoming codependence find meaning and inspiration in your life beyond your relationship find meaning and inspiration in your life beyond your relationship , whatever that might be for you for some people , it 's religion , for other people it 's their own form of spirituality , for others it 's developing an appreciation for art , music , nature or something else that is meaningful remember that it 's an ongoing a process strive for progress and not perfection i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist i am also a certified substance abuse professional i work with individual adults and couples i have helped many individuals and couples to overcome codependent behavior to find out more about me , visit my web site josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , feel free to call me at or email me josephineolivia aol com photo credit giuss death via photopin cc photo credit puzzler mostly off mourning loss via photopin cc photo credit texaseagle via photopin cc photo credit kjunstorm via photopin cc photo credit diverdewan via photopin cc
