maybe it was returning to work a fairly negative environment which sometimes sucks the life out of me maybe it 's being home alone after spending more than a week surrounded by others maybe it is my continued fatigue despite recent interventions maybe it 's just a normal reaction to returning from vacation whatever the reason , i'm feeling a bit blue blue worries me i do n't like feeling blue blue is tiring , and i'm already tired blue may mean a depression relapse is on the way feeling blue is a little like living in suspended animation i'm waiting to see what comes next will it go away ? will it get worse ? or will i just stay suspended , waiting ? blue worries me i do n't know why i'm feeling blue i do n't really care to figure it out either i 'd rather it just went away i'm glad i have a day off tomorrow i can rest , visit my therapist , and hopefully go for a run i 'd like to get back into a running and exercise routine , although i do n't feel like doing much of anything lack of motivation another symptom of feeling blue damn , i hate feeling blue !
