dinah is away this week so roy and i are filling in here 's a quick blog post more to come i stumbled over the center for history and new media web site this morning and found a video tour of an old soviet gulag in addition to the video , there 's an accompanying audio tour in russian , with an english text translation the camp is better than most , from what i gathered from the description , because it eventually housed formerly high ranking prisoners the thing that struck me most was this comment by the tour guide , about transfers out of the gulag to other facilities if one could leave a camp or a jail , a mental institution meant a life sentence , because the effect of mind altering drugs could not be reversed i wonder how many tourists have gone away from that tour thinking that psychiatrists are equivalent to political persecutors i 've seen this attitude about psychiatric medications reflected in some legal opinions here in the united states as well , thankfully in cases a couple decades old , but present nonetheless the idea that psychiatric medications are mind altering rather than mind correcting of course , there are people who have been hurt by psychiatric medications or who feel that they have been permanently damaged by them and i'm not dismissing or ignoring those experiences i was just struck by the international nature of the stigma about meds
