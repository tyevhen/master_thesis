although it was old and sterile , i was so proud of our my dorm it was exciting to be away from home for the first time and more exciting to have three other suite mates ! over time , my excitement about living with three other girls began to diminish as i noticed we all had different ideas about cleanliness unfortunately , our biggest point of contention was the bathroom the four of us shared earlier in the semester , we all decided to take a week and keep the bathroom clean when it was my week , i took cleaning the bathroom very seriously my roommate , who was just as phobic about cleaning as me , made it her goal to have a clean bathroom during her week then there were the suitemates well , let 's say they were not as dedicated imagine , if you will , a bath tub at the end of the week with four girls bathing twice a day using hair products , baby oil , body wash , shower gel , and shaving cream well , let 's say it was not pretty not able to take the filth , my roommate and i broke down and cleaned that disgusting bathroom during our off weeks following the months of cleaning , i became known as miss clean four girls in a bathroom yuck ! seems that my suite was not the only one facing hygiene issues brewing next door was a problem between two girls , who were best friends , and another girl who lived in her room alone the lone girl seemed a little different from the rest of us she lived a long way from home , she never went home on the weekends , and she rarely spoke of her family physically she was very plain , rarely washed her hair , and wore the same plaid shirt day after day although she was different , we made an effort to include her in our social activities one of our favorite activities was to watch our soap opera every afternoon one particular day , we were watching our show and the girl did not show up after the show was over no one dared to talk during the show , we inquired about her whereabouts one of the best friends chimed , she had to study today , but i am glad she could n't come she has worn that same jacket all week and has a terrible body odor after sitting quietly for a minute , i opened my big mouth and put my proverbial foot in it you know someone really should tell her that she needs to wash her jacket and her hair immediately , all eyes turned to me and one of the friends smiled and said , great idea ! you would be great helping someone clean up suddenly it was unanimous that i would represent the group by informing the girl about her bad hygiene as a helper , i considered it my duty to enlighten our neighbor about her hygiene issues after several days of putting off the conversation , i finally found myself alone with her in my dorm watching music videos nervously , i sat watching the new sting solo video and commented on how i wished that the police had never broken up okay , i thought it is now or never finally i looked at the girl , expressed that her body odor was not pleasant to other people , and told her that she needed to do a better job at cleaning her hair and clothes after taking in what i said , she acknowledged that she needed to take care of herself better yes , go me ! at that moment , i was so proud of myself ! ! however , my feelings of success were short lived during one of our afternoon soap opera times , everyone was gathered in our suite as usual all of the sudden a smell permeated the room of perfume and body odor someone yelled , who is wearing that perfume ? ! slowly , all eyes turned to the girl innocently she looked at the group and said , do you guys like my new perfume ? cindy suggested that i wear it scientist have found that perfume enhances body odor okay , as you see this situation did not go so well unfortunately , just because i was chosen as the right person to talk to the girl does n't necessarily make me the best person the problem was that the girl needed a lot more than attention , assistance , and education than i could give her in fact , she could have really benefitted from all of us working with her actually , hygiene is a process of education , information , practice , and reevaluation although i was elected to fix her problem , i was not the answer to her hygiene issue student hygiene must be taught fast forward to my days as school counselor one day a teacher comes to me about a freshman with hygiene issues and she tells me that someone me should speak to him about what to do to stop his body odor immediately , my school counselor super powers go into action ! sure ! i will see what i can do before i called the student into my office , i had a flashback to the day i spoke to the girl wait what are you doing ? you may not be the best person for this job i really started to think about who were the right people to help this student just because i am the school counselor does n't always mean that i have all the answers however , i may be part of the solution teen hygiene according to the american academy of pediatrics , hormonal changes between the ages of in girls and in boys are the biggest causes of body odor other factors like sweat , dirty clothing , tight clothing , food choices , failure to bathe regularly , dirty bedding , poor hygiene , smoking , and drug use , can make body odor unpleasant for other students and staff who are in close proximity what are the top reasons that teens stink bad breathe caused by lack of brushing , tooth decay , or gum infections body odor from pheromones to sexually attract or repel others , toxins that the body is trying to expel like alcohol or food , and bacteria from dead skin foot odor odor from private areas sadly , if a student does not learn good hygiene by elementary school , he or she may have a difficult time in middle and high school dr ken shore believes that educators must not ignore hygiene issues as it can often lead to teasing and bullying so what can a school counselor do ?
