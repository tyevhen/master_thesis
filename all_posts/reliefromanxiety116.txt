i 'll be honest , i had no clue what to expect when i went to university but , i feel that you may feel more prepared if you have some sort of a step by step process of how it all weeks i presume most universities will be the same friends everyone is in exactly the same boat , so do n't worry about not making friends you 'll meet new people left right and center i was worried i would n't meet anyone , but there are thousands of new students , so it 's never a worry you will find someone freshers typically this is the best two weeks of your university life and i have to say i really enjoyed it try and get into it as much as possible drinking does n't have to be a part of it if you do n't want to all the events should already be organised , so do n't worry about not knowing where to go enrollment you should have a few days where you 'll pick up information for your course , id badges and so your university will let you know the details of that it 's usually the first weekend of arrival and there are usually checklists online it 's a busy few days , but once it 's done you do n't have to worry about it anymore accommodation your university should tell you the dates that your able to move into your accommodation from that day forward it 's up to you to move your new life into your new room ! lectures i think lectures tend to start on the second week of freshers these are only usually introductory , and the main body does n't tend to start until after freshers is over relaxed university is unlike anything you 've ever experienced depending on your course , attendance may or may not be registered in seminars or in lectures and although you are paying to attend , it is generally up to you how much you attend of course , there is a correlation between low attendance and grades but , university is all about your choices societies there will be hundreds of societies to join , i signed up to too many , so i am intending to stick to two or three at a time although , it 's great to join , there is also a balance that needs to be struck with money and when the work starts to roll in to be fair , is n't too much in the first year compared to others you may feel like a big fish in a small pond , but you will begin to understand it all within a few days things will click into place amy xx
