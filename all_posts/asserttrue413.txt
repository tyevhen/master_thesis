we know that for double stranded dna , the number of purines a , g will always equal the number of pyrimidines t , c , because complementarity depends on a t and g c pairings but do purines have to equal pyrimidines in single stranded dna ? chargaff 's second parity rule says yes simple observation says no suppose you have a couple thousand single stranded dna samples all you have to do to see if chargaff 's second rule is correct is create a graph of a versus t , where each point represents the a and t adenine and thymine amounts in a particular dna sample if a t as predicted by chargaff , the graph should look like a straight line with a slope of for fun , i grabbed the sequenced dna genome of clostridium botulinum a strain atcc available from the fasta link on this page be ready for a several megabyte text dump , which contains coding sequences for genes of average length bases each , and for each gene , i plotted the a content versus the t content a plot of thymine t versus adenine a content for all genes in c botulinum coding regions the greyed area represents areas where t a most genes fall in the white area where a t as you can see , the resulting cloud of points not only does n't form a straight line of slope , it does n't even cluster on the degree line at all the center of the cluster is well below the degree line , and this is the amazing part the major axis of the cluster is almost at degrees to the degree line , indicating that the quantity a t tends to be conserved a similar plot of g versus c below shows a somewhat different scatter pattern , but again notice that the centroid of the cluster is well off the degree centerline this means chargaff 's second rule does n't hold except for the few genes that randomly fell on the centerline a plot of cytosine c versus guanine g for all genes in all coding regions of c botulinum again , notice that the points cluster well away from the degree line where they would have been expected to cluster , according to chargaff the numbers of bases of each type in the botulinum genome are g c t a amazingly , there are , more adenines than thymines in the genome here , i'm somewhat sloppily equating genome with combined coding regions likewise , excess guanines number , on average , each gene contains excess purines adenine and guanine the above graphs are in no way unique to c botulinum if you do similar plots for other organisms , you 'll see similar results , with excess purines being most numerous in organisms that have low g c content as explained in my earlier posts on this subject , the purine pyrimidine ratio for coding regions tends to be high in low gc organisms and low in high gc organisms , a relationship that holds across all bacterial and eukaryotic domains
