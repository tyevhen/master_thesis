it 's am , and i'm awake it was a rough night of sleep the evening leading into the night probably set me up i had a tough evening , too i was sad i was frustrated i was feeling pressure to get well quick but mostly , i was just tired of being sick i'm awake now , and those feelings are all still here they are a jumble of a mess of emotions they made me tired , yet kept me awake the sadness is more like grief i'm grieving the loss of almost years of stability being this sick again rudely reminds me of all the things this illness has stolen from me it 's not the best thing for me to think about , i know , but it 's where i'm at freedom , energy , vitality , relationships , employment these are just a few of the golden nuggets snapped up by this illness will i ever get them back ? i'm frustrated to be feeling so low when i know i 've been taking care of myself i 've been doing the right things , maybe not perfectly , but c'mon ! i 'll ask again , what else can i or should i do to keep the darkness at bay ? i know , i know it 's an illness like cancer , no matter how healthy one behaves , the tumor may still grow my tumor metaphor for depression , just in case anyone is confused is currently on the prowl , and apparently there are no predators to keep it in check i'm feeling pressure to get well quick for a couple of reasons first , i'm supposed to be on a plane to boston in days i cannot , will not , miss the boston marathon however , i do n't want to leave the hospital having made no gains in my mood either secondly , i ca n't afford to be here with no benefits to draw on , each day i am out of work is another day of zero pay i do n't have a reserve to fall back on i rely on every hour i work to pay my bills right now i'm looking at a hour , versus my typical hour , paycheck i do n't know from where the money will materialize to pay my bills it 's a stressor i can hardly tolerate and speaking of finances yesterday , i found out about a promising new treatment option which my treatment team thinks would work beautifully for me i was excited i was willing let 's go , i said unfortunately , this treatment is so new , insurance companies do n't cover it i could pay out of pocket , they said , but the cost ranges from five to ten thousand dollars i was crestfallen i was tearful obviously , it was no longer an option when will insurance companies stop dictating what doctors can and cannot do ? and if this were a new treatment for cancer , would it already be approved ? perhaps i'm frustrated with the politics of the system i'm sad to be here , hospitalized after so many years , and still feeling so dark and so low i'm feeling pressured to get well quick , which probably is n't helpful and i'm stressed about the finances of it all i wish i could just focus on healing , because that 's what i really want to do focus on healing that 's what i need to do
