hypnosis , also referred to as hypnotherapy or hypnotic suggestion , is an altered state of consciousness this state of consciousness is usually achieved with the help of a hypnotherapist and is different from your everyday awareness the purpose of hypnosis as a therapeutic technique is to help you gain more control over your behavior , emotions or physical well being it 's not clear , biologically and neurologically speaking , how hypnosis works however , neuro imaging of the brain under hypnosis has been studied , giving more respect to this controversial treatment what can be said is that hypnosis creates a state of deep relaxation and quiets the mind when you 're hypnotized , you can concentrate intensely on a specific thought , memory , feeling or sensation while blocking out distractions you 're more open than usual to suggestions , and this can be used to change your behavior and thereby improve your health and well being hypnosis does not cure physical or psychological ailments hypnosis puts the mind into a deeply relaxed state that appears to bypass our cognitive filtering system in essence , a hypnotic suggestion makes a thought or action more probable i was hypnotized once , as part of a group class seminar it was a most wonderful experience i felt deeply and profoundly relaxed , yet aware light as air an ease never before known we were told that no hypnotic suggestions would be offered , but i kinda wish the hypnotherapist put a curb your eating of chocolate suggestion for good measure !
