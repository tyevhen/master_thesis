i'm grateful for all that we share , for laughter and music , for quiet moments and reflection i can remember some other new year 's eves that were more lively with parties , evenings with friends , dinners out but this year , like mary kate , i'm dreaming , not of revelry , but of warm contentment and reflection this is a time to be mindful of blessings , realizing that another year has passed , that time is increasingly finite , that nothing or no one is forever or ever more treasured so this will be an evening to be still , to reflect , and to dream , ever mindful of the passage of time and the blessings of each moment
