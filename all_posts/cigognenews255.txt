there is a piece in the new york times science section , september , , by the nobel prize winner eric kandelsee http www nytimes com opinion sunday the new science of mind html he is discussing the advances being made in the science of the mind , and in particular , psychotherapy what he means by advances or progress is a deeper understanding of brain function here he states , consider the biology of depression we can discern the outlines of a complex neural circuit that becomes disordered in depressive illness so here we have it it is all about brain structure and function no discussion of the human being that carries around that brain or her experiences the brain and the mind are identical for him he seems to think that brain scans are the wave of the future so that we can ferret out the nerve circuits involved in mental illness he cites the work of helen mayberg of emory university who gave two types of treatment to subjects cognitive therapy where they train people to develop a more positive attitude to life and its adversities , or anti depressant medication she could tell by examining the function of the insula who would respond and who would not those who started with a low baseline did well with cognitive therapy those who had above baseline insula activity did better with medication what s wrong with this picture ? are those the two key approaches in the treatment of depression ? is there any room for feelings ? either we medicate or change the subjects minds about life ? it is no small thing that he is friends with a leader in the cognitive approach aaron beck what he believes is that they have discovered biologic markers for depression and once we do that , what ? i have an idea why don t we try to figure out what psychological factors change brain function ? why don t we bring the emotional and mental into the equation ? otherwise , we are forced into a reductionist approach to consider it all within the brain a form of pure solipsism like there is a brain but no person with experience or if there is a person with experience what are the experiences ? and how do they change the brain ? that is the real domain of psychotherapy the brain and mind are not identical otherwise how can the mind change the activity of the brain ? for example , when we say this drill won t hurt your teeth and it doesn t or how hypnosis can change brain function there are levels of reality the chemical , the neurological and the psychological they are different and cannot be equated to one another otherwise we get into the bind of saying that anorexia is due to too much or too little dopamine or serotonin and we will never find out what makes for more or less of these chemicals floating around in our brains so instead of minutely examining neural circuits or biochemistry let s be psychologists and psychiatrists and examine the mind if i read kandel properly there is really no mind to deal with of course there are changes on all levels due to experience but they are not necessarily causes rather , they are accompaniments they are responses , by and large , to experience so what are those experiences ? look at migraine headaches we have looked into this affliction and discovered that very early experience , anoxia at birth , is a major cause the vascular system shuts down in an attempt to conserve oxygen it is experience that counts here , and a specific kind of experience if we examine the brain for years we will come no closer to understanding migraine of course neural circuits change as most neuro biologic functions change in reaction to trauma this anoxic condition will certainly change the cortisol levels and the output of serotonin but they are not causes ? does the function of the insula respond to severe input along with other limbic structures ? certainly they are the result , not the cause of the symptom scientists removed from their feelings do not consider feelings in either causes or treatments it is all cerebral , they assume it is very much like assuming that those low in dopamine will not have a exaggerated reaction to coffee while those already agitated will have a greater reaction to coffee kandel maintains that psychotherapy is a biological treatment a brain therapy and therefore there is no real place for psychotherapy and then he goes on , any discussion of the biologic basis of psychiatric disorders must include genetics not epigenetics where all the late research points , but inheritance again no place for life experience it is either inherited or the problem is in the brain he says it individual biology and genetics make up the contribution to such things as depression that is why it is a small step to operating on the brain to try to change depression again , when we get on the wrong train every stop we make is wrong let s get on the right one
