so i figured i 'd share some ! many though not all of these have been posted recently as in the last month on my facebook page , so if you follow that you may already have seen them you also might not have several of the quotes featured below were found in the book walking on water reading , writing , and revolution by derrick jensen , which is very good really you should read it ! on your own , you have to face the responsibility for how you spend time but in school you do n't what they make you do may obviously be a waste but at least the responsibility is n't charged to your account school in this respect is , once again , like the army or jail once you 're in , you may have all kinds of problems but freedom is n't one of them jerry farber so long as we only believe in the justice of the state , of the law made by those in power , to serve those in power so long will we continue to be exploited by those in power derrick jensen if you ve told a child a thousand times and he still does not understand , then it is not the child who is the slow learner walter barbee grades are a problem on the most general level , they 're an explicit acknowledgment that what you 're doing is insufficiently interesting or rewarding for you to do it on your own nobody ever gave you a grade for learning how to play , how to ride a bicycle , or how to kiss one of the best ways to destroy love for any of these activities would be through the use of grades , and the coercion and judgment they represent grades are a cudgel to bludgeon the unwilling into doing what they do n't want to do , an important instrument in inculcating children into a lifelong subservience to whatever authority happens to be thrust over them derrick jensen modern schools universities push students into habits of depersonalized learning , alienation from nature and sexuality , obedience to hierarchy , fear of authority , self objectification , chilling competitiveness these character traits are the essence of the twisted personality type of modern industrialism they are precisely the character traits needed to maintain a social system that is utterly out of touch with nature , sexuality , real human needs arthur evans the function of high school , then , is not so much to communicate knowledge as to oblige children finally to accept the grading system as a measure of their inner excellence and a function of the self destructive process in american children is to make them willing to accept not their own , but a variety of other standards , like a grading system , for measuring themselves it is thus apparent that the way american culture is now integrated it would fall appart if it did not engender feelings of inferiority and worthlessness jules henry school is indeed a training for later life not because it teaches the rs more or less , but because it instills the essential cultural nightmare fear of failure , envy of success , and absurdity jules henry a truth 's initial commotion is directly proportional to how deeply the lie was believed when a well packaged web of lies has been sold gradually to the masses over generations , the truth will seem utterly preposterous and its speaker , a raving lunatic dresden james people do n't mind being in prison as long as no one else is free but stage a jailbreak , and everybody else freaks out william deresiewicz schools have not necessarily much to do with education they are mainly institutions of control where certain basic habits must be inculcated in the young education is quite different and has little place in school winston churchill school prepares for the alienating institutionalization of life by teaching the need to be taught ivan illich think of reading like riding a bicycle one doesn t consciously name the muscles involved or the particular actions required of each , or the parts of the bicycle , or newton s laws of motion , or the physics of gears , or the changes in brain chemistry associated with balance one gets up on the seat and starts to pedal david albert the founding fathers provided jails called schools , equipped with tortures called education school is where you go between when your parents ca n't take you and industry ca n't take you john updike there were no sex classes no friendship classes no classes on how to navigate a bureaucracy , build an organization , raise money , create a database , buy a house , love a child , spot a scam , talk someone out of suicide , or figure out what was important to me not knowing how to do these things is what messes people up in life , not whether they know algebra or can analyze literature william upski wimsatt children are not our own art products to be turned out well , but their own life work in continual process jan fortune wood you don t have to see the whole staircase , just take the first step martin luther king until one is committed , there is hesitancy , the chance to draw back , always ineffectiveness concerning all acts of initiative and creation , there is one elementary truth , the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans that the moment one definitely commits oneself , then providence moves too all sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred a whole stream of events issues from the decision , raising in one 's favour all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance , which no man could have dreamed would have come his way whatever you do , or dream you can , begin it boldness has genius , power and magic in it begin it now w
