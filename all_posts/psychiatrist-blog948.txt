one of our blog and podcast followers wrote to us with a few questions i'm not going to mention the person 's name without permission , but they 're a pre med student with an interest in psychiatry i thought i 'd take a stab at some of the answers dinah and roy can chime in with their own thoughts on the subjects here we go dinah i 'll chime in in green roy ? roy ? where are you roy ? firstly why did each of you choose to go into psychiatry ? clinkshrink there were many reasons i loved neuroanatomy and did well in it i was a big fan of the popular science brain books as a med student andreasen 's the broken brain and anything by michael gazzaniga i enjoyed mysteries and black box kind of puzzles , and the human mind is the biggest black box puzzle in medicine dinah i was intrinsically interested in why people do what they do and feel how they feel i 'd planned to get a ph d in psychology and do research , and then realized that if i became a psychiatrist , i 'd have the option to do both research and clinical work so why did n't clinkshrink become a neurologist ? ? ? clink redux i did n't become a neurologist because gross neurological impairment was n't interesting but mind brain issues were neurologists do n't deal with hallucinations and delusions , usually there 's a big difference between psychiatry and neurology roy please also take a look at this post , where we also addressed this question in more detail in who wants to be a psychiatrist i grew up watching several family members develop hallucinations and behavior changes , questioning how this could happen to someone 's mind i started out wanting to go into neuroscience research , deciding to go to medical school only to learn more about how the brain and body work together i later learned how much i enjoyed helping people with these problems that i decided to go into psychiatry how do you cope with some of the stupid and strange stuff people say to you ? how long does it take to learn to keep a straight face ? clinkshrink the strange stuff is what psychiatrists enjoy hearing about complicated delusional systems can be bizarre and fascinating and i enjoy listening to that it 's not hard to keep a straight face when you know the person actually believes what 's happening to them and it 's frightening or bothering them if you put yourself in their mind set and think about what it would be like if your food really were being poisoned , or you really did have something implanted in your teeth that controlled your mind , well , that would n't be very fun dinah there were a few times as a medical student when i did want to laugh i have n't found that anyone says anything i feel is stupid sometimes i have have trouble empathizing with peoples' ideas , especially if they are paranoid or are offensive to me this is unusual , though , and mostly i enjoy listening to stories about people 's lives , and nothing about their pain feels stupid or strange some of it feels desperately sad roy it does n't feel like coping , it feels like trying to learn how to speak someone else 's language , and understanding how they see the world differently from how i see it do ssri 's make non depressed people relatively happy ? do tcas have any mood altering affect on non depressed people as well ? clinkshrink antidepressants are mood correcting rather than mood elevating there is some research to suggest that ssri 's may make non depressed introverts more outgoing , and i have direct experience with non depressed antisocial patients who like ssri 's because it makes them more apathetic and less reactive to minor slights dinah and roy may have other experiences dinah many people take ssri 's for anxiety and find them very helpful , even if they are n't depressed i guess what clink said also , they can induce mania , so theoretically , if someone with no mood disorder takes an ssri , they could unmask bipolar disorder roy while antidepressants can result in a flattening of affect for some more so for ssris than tcas , at least one study found that nondepressed subjects had a more positive outlook what is the neurological basis behind the symptomatology in disorders such as depression , bipolar and schizophrenia ? does it explain all the various subcategories assigned to depression and bipolar ? clinkshrink this one is easy we just do n't know in spite of all the research being done in neuroimaging with pet scans and fmri , we still do n't know for sure what goes awry in these disorders , and we ca n't use these technologies to diagnose or subtype psychiatric diseases dinah as per clink we do n't know roy i spent three years doing postmortem brain research in schizophrenia there are quite a few replicable findings , such as reductions in markers of synaptic connections and fewer numbers of certain kinds of brain cells however , we do n't know what they mean or how they are associated with symptoms of the disease like dinah said , we do n't know for certain , but there are many good theories why and how do some people with depression suffer from psychotic symptoms ? clinkshrink see answer there 's still a lot we do n't know some people are genetically predisposed , some people have vascular or traumatic brain injuries that predispose them , some people have overwhelming life events that trigger an event for me a better question is what makes people so resilient able to survive horrible childhoods or natural disasters and bounce back , while others ca n't handle routine life events without checking in to a hospital dinah regarding the question great question we do n't know regarding clink 's answer i agree that their are some amazingly resilient peeps out there i do n't , however , know of people who end up in the hospital because of inability to handle routine life events seems to me that people have episodes of illness sometimes they identify a precipitant , often they do n't , and sometimes i think the search for a triggering event is just a human nature way of trying to explain what may , at this point , be the unexplainable clink redux some of my patients with severe aspd seek admission to hospitals for , by their own report , being unable to handle life in other words , having no place to live , no friends or family to help them , and not being able to keep a job they lack the resilience and ability to maintain the basic necessities of life or a girlfriend breaks up with them and they end up in the hospital what are your views on prevention for psych related problems ? how do you think they should fit in a model of public health ? clinkshrink this is the next phase of psychiatry primary prevention we already have national depression screening day in october , and primary care providers are starting to use simple screening instruments for various psych disorders all of this is well and good , but it means nothing if everyone ca n't afford a doctor finding the problem is one thing , doing something to solve it is even better dinah prevention ? we 're a long way from knowing how to prevent mental illness world peace and drug prevention would go a long way towards helping some people to not develop problems roy prevention is the holy grail insert monty python quote here so those are my answers to lots of questions and mine , too !
