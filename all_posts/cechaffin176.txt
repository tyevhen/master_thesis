it surprises me , but since i 've been feeling better i have developed a slight resentment against all the medication i must take in the morning it takes three swallows here 's my menu morning lamictal two mg tablets adderall two mg tablets abilify one mg tablet ms contin two mg tablets effexor three mg capsules celebrex one mg capsule asa one mg tablet afternoon adderall one mg bedtime klonopinone one mg tablet ms contin three mg tablets so , that 's five medications for mental health , two for pain , and one for preventing vascular problems aspirin at my last visit to my shrink i wondered if we could cut anything he responded by saying , you have n't been stable very long , craig just keep taking them and enjoy yourself great shrink ! like all mental patients , as soon as i start feeling better i want to take credit for it , thinking my naturally defective chemistry overcome by my newfound health this is a fatal misapprehension fatal how many times have i had a patient in practice who felt better , unilaterally stopped their medicines and relapsed ? my worst case was my father he would n't see a shrink so i slipped him some antidepressants and an anti anxiety agent after a couple of weeks he felt better and stopped the medicine after two partial responses to the medicine in the midst of a serious depression , he quit both times then he suicided was i a bad son and a good doctor ? a good doctor and a bad son ? i lacked the authority of a real doctor for my dad , thus the treatment was partially undermined by that , the lack of the empowering mysterium tremendum of the white coat as a son i had to plead with and cajole my father to take his meds perhaps it forestalled his suicide for a time , as we discovered after his death that he had been writing suicide notes since march when he finally committed the deed in november but it was all for naught he was from the john wayne generation and his last note said something like , it 's either the hospital or the end i ca n't bear to go to the hospital his mother had been hospitalized twice for shock therapy and i do n't think he could stand the shame tragic but predictable , although his death was n't we all thought him a survivor thus i adjure you , all mood impaired citizenry , to keep taking your meds as the price of sanity it 's been shown that if you have one clinical depression , your odds of a second one are great , and your chance of responding to your first successful medicine are reduced in the second go round many psychiatrists advocate a lifetime of medication for one serious depression i favor giving people one chance with their first depression , maintaining them for a year and then gradually withdrawing the medicine but in cases of manic depression , medication is surely needed lifetime , and many first time depressives are later diagnosed with manic depression if the pancreas and liver can become diseased and need insulin replacement and interferon , respectively , we have no qualms but if the brain is diseased we confuse it with our personality in what ernest becker calls the causa sui project , where we attribute the success to ourselves and think that it 's actually our own power that has delivered us , when in fact it is simply the treatment of a diseased organ you are not your depression clinical depression means a diseased organ , save in this case it is the organ of consciousness and easy to mistake for your self , a fatal mistake to all of you who do n't know better , and to all you who do , remember to take your meds faithfully until your doctor lessens your dosage to do otherwise is stupid , and as in my father 's case , may result in tragedy he never got to meet his great grandson lately i 've been happy about poetry again , its possibilities , how the pleasure of a good reading can exceed the joy of a movie or a book of prose that i labor in this antiquated and unpopular field does not minimize its impact for a few and the purpose of poetry ? no one has said it better than sir phillip sydney of the elizabethan age , though he stole from aristotle to teach and to delight in other words , a sugar coated reality pill to speak somewhat derisively , or better , an adventure in words that lifts you up out of your reality and gives you the perspective of another , which can be salutary as for contemporary poetry , there is too much striving for delight and not enough teaching , but given the state of culture , any morality is usually rejected out of hand as a violation of boundaries , unless the morality is insinuated so carefully that the reader does n't know it until it is too late i have a little essay in melic entitled poetry and morality , and another on prophetic poetry , begin with the tenth paragraph , if any should be interested in further speculation along these lines i'm busy proofing the proofs of my selected poems from my publisher now it 's tedious to proofread you ca n't really read the poems while doing it it 's more of a housekeeping exercise , and in that frame of mind many of the poems seem limp to a glancing eye but i know better i believe in my poetry my poetry often has the power to get through the modern multi tasking brain and sometimes stop it cold this has always been my ambition , a poetry of power , or as i have defined it , language distilled into its most powerful form more thoughts on this in my essay in tryst here i will break continuity and post a picture of each of our cats for lkd , though i'm sorry to report that i do n't know how to transfer new photos from our digital camera directly into my computer through kodak easy share it seems only the pictures held in the card memory , and not the current pictures , can be uploaded here 's topaz and here 's jojo the pictures do n't do them justice , especially topaz , who is a beauty and whom we sometimes call remedios after a beauty in one hundred years of solitude as you know , our dog 's name is j alfred prufrock and i hope to have a picture of him soon meanwhile the weather is brisk and sunny , the pineapple sage is blooming , in fact i have a haiku about that pineapple sage blooms hummingbirds flitter and sup from the long , red tubes if you have never smelled pineapple sage , you 're in for a treat when you encounter it great for iced tea ! and how about a short example of a poem of power ? keep the faith you say two friends were murdered but it 's a nice day and there must be middle ground between the abandoned mineshaft and the holstein sky ants kill ants as easily as popping sodas some father fish swallow their fry , others rock them gently inside their jaws sometimes an ox is gored by another ox and dies sometimes a country sends its young to float like dynamited carp in distant rice paddies if mercy were based on evidence i 'd shoot you so , with medicines and poetic morality , cat portraits and poems of power i leave you kilobunnies , ce
