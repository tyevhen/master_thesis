i give my dog toby a really hard time about his biting habits whenever he gets really excited , he has to bite something , anything , be it you or something you are carrying or our other dog 's ears or legs he just ca n't help himself i always yell at him or grab his snout and tell him no because sometimes it really does hurt ! and i hate that when i get home everyday the first thing that happens is i get attacked by my own dog ! however , i have made a saddening discovery that i am more like toby than i care to admit when i get nervous or anxious , by natural response is to bite ! no joke ! not people , lol , but i do have my own quirks all my life i have been a nail biter i used to get in trouble as a kid for doing it when i am nervous or anxious about something , one of the bad habits i do is start biting my nails now my nails are so fragile anytime i actually grow them out any small amount they chip and break pretty quickly one day i hope to have long beautiful nails , otherwise i might just have to go the manicured way and get the cool fake ones on but for now , its boy hands for me another bad habit i started because of feeling anxious was biting my lips this may sound weird or gross , but i would chew on them and peel skin off not even really realizing it heres the gross truth about what happens if you do this eventually , you destroy a spit valve in your mouth this causes a bubble called a mucocele to form on the inside of your mouth that will not go away unless it is surgically removed its a minor procedure that does n't take very long at all but its annoying enough to make you go in and get it done after all was said and done , it cost me around bucks to have it done so now when i get anxious and i bite on my lips , i feel the small scar inside and ask , do i really have all that money to spend on this right now ? and then i stop i have been thinking about this post for awhile now and it was n't until today that i made the connection with me and toby i guess i should n't give him such a hard time you might also like finding beauty in the storm personal bill of rights anxiety is full of ups and downs warning an anxiety free post linkwithin
