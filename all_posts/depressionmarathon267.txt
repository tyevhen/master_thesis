i just found out the website goodtherapy org , a site dedicated to helping people find therapists and advocating for ethical therapy , has chosen my blog as one of their favorite depression blogs from around the web this came as a total surprise i am humbled and honored by the unexpected recognition when i began this blog almost years ago , i had no idea what to expect i hoped a few people would find me and take the time to read my words i hoped to give voice to a debilitating illness which derailed my life i prayed others would find encouragement and solace in my struggles and triumphs and i wanted to fight the stigma which surrounds and burdens those of us battling depression over posts later , i hope i 've accomplished at least a couple of these goals a few times writing this blog has been more therapeutic for me than i ever imagined knowing i'm accountable to you , my readers , keeps me fighting when i want to give up , keeps me running when i feel too tired to move , and motivates me to always do the next right thing if you 'll continue reading , i 'll keep writing i'm extremely grateful to jo sahlin at goodtherapy org for her recognition and support
