more and more lately i 've felt that there 's a huge gap between where i am , and where i want to be in my life i love being around people , and i love being busy or at least semi busy , so i do n't know how i ended up with such a quiet life i guess because it happened gradually or maybe it 's more accurate to say that i was simply happy being not that busy for a while but that 's no longer what i need or want so then the issue becomes how can i make my life into what i want it to be ? starting new activities where there is n't anyone i know is incredibly difficult for me it scares me and not in the fairly normal apprehensive about new situations way , but in a terrified chest tightening mild panic attack inducing way new situations are only okay to me if i'm with someone i care about either family or friend so that makes things more difficult but before i even get to that point , i need to figure out what it is i want to be doing so i compiled a list of my interests the other day , and am going to see what i can do that involves those interests , and whether i can rope any friends or family into doing them with me ! because of all that , i 've been feeling really dissatisfied and frustrated lately add emotional stress to that a breakup we 're still friends , but working on a friendship can still be difficult , someone i'm close too going through chemo that 's a big one and things have been more then a little rough but i'm okay and i know that i 'll find my way , i'm just not sure how long it 's going to take me , or how difficult it 's going to be i have lots of thoughts and ideas floating around in my head , and hopefully at least a few of them will make it into blog posts in the not too distant future ! peace , idzie you might also like making transitions and following passions grown unschooler anna j cook the experience of life happening this year in life including dogs , trips , zines and linkwithin
