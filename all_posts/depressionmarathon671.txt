i had my tenth ect treatment today that 's about more than i wanted to have , which indicates how far down i had gone and how much i was willing to do to get out of the black hole and i think i am out it 's taken abundantly longer than i would have liked but i think i have finally cleared the rim and am crawling away from the abyss this depression episode has been devastating , demoralizing , and debilitating i do not wish to look back with regret , but it is hard not to do so i am especially devastated by the loss of my ability to work again prior to the last few years , i spent years on disability secondary to this illness i worked my way off of it , and i was proud of my success in doing so now i am back on disability and quite fearful of returning to my job devastating working one 's way off of disability is a complicated , risky process there are no guarantees if i work too much , i lose my benefits if i work within the ssdi limits , it amounts to very few hours and does not give me an adequate gage of my fitness to return to regular duty it 's complicated it 's risky it 's causing me considerable stress stress which is compounded by my company 's wish to get me back to regular duty as quickly as possible i'm not sure how i'm going to manage this process again i'm worried perhaps i'm getting ahead of myself by worrying about work after all , i just had what i hope is my last ect treatment today i'm grateful to be feeling better as you recall , it took awhile before the treatments seemed to make a difference it was a long while before i turned the corner and began emerging from the hole for a time i never thought it was going to let me go , but today depression has loosened its grip i am feeling more free than i have felt since late february the struggle has lessened i'm relieved
