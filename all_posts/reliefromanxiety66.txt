although i 'd say i was quite mature for my age when growing up , this did n't mean i was n't sensitive to what was going on around me i had to grow up fast and therefore i did n't see things like my peers did those things that my friends would be upset over , hardly affected me because i had experienced much bigger things than an argument with a friend however , even though this may be the case today , i would say that i am sensitive in another way although i have the maturity and strength from battling my mental illness , i do find it a struggle if things in my life are out of kilter for example , an argument with a parent or not hearing back about an event and so forth it 's true that i wo n't go into complete meltdown , but it still does bother me and for a lot of people i do n't think it would as much i believe that this is just my way of coping i feel that many years ago , i used to cope a lot better with that kind of thing , but now i tend to struggle more with it and i'm not too sure why it is nevertheless , i still try to work on it on a daily basis what are your stories ? amy xx
