amazon the new montgomery ward amazon let 's be honest is a company in trouble oh , its financials are fine it 's profitable , even it 's growing by all normal metrics , it 's not in trouble at all but common sense says the spit 's about to hit the fan amazon is on a collision course with destiny the destiny of all companies who ever tried to do too much kmart , federated dept stores , montgomery ward , allied stores , southland corp , ames department stores , the circle k corp carter hawley hale stores the list goes on let 's be blunt amazon is just another department store , except they have no physical storefront but lack of a physical storefront does n't mean they wo n't suffer the fate of all the unwieldy , poorly managed department store chains that have gone before history has a way of dealing with do too much retailers and now , e tailers amazon 's business model is a model of confusion their business is really three businesses eretailing what amazon calls egm electronics and general merchandise , publishing , and cloud services according to amazon 's k filing , egm currently accounts for of the business and that 's precisely where the big trouble lies recent indications are that amazon has reached a tipping point for , amazon 's net income was a paltry million on net sales of billion compare this to 's net income of billion on billion in net sales basic earnings per share has gone from to basically , amazon has become a logistics company without wheels to survive in its present form , it badly needs to acquire an airborne express except that ae has already been acquired by dhl , or maybe a railroad and a package delivery company ideally , it also needs to acquire a payment processing system a paypal why not just admit the obvious ? amazon needs to acquire ebay the alternative is to join the long list of department stores that tried to be all things to all customers and ended up broke amazon claims it will enjoy greater efficiencies going forward by opening more fulfillment centers and putting pressure on suppliers but their story , frankly , is starting to sound old and is how shall we say ? at this point painfully unconvincing inefficiencies are rising faster than efficiencies , at amazon that 's what the numbers show and that 's the real point you do n't have to be a numbers guru to see where amazon is headed , though just look at what amazon is trying to sell , and draw your own conclusions the following list was taken directly from the pulldown menu on their u s website amazon instant video appliances apps for android arts , crafts sewing automotive baby beauty books cell phones accessories clothing accessories computers electronics gift cards grocery gourmet food health personal care home kitchen industrial scientific jewelry kindle store magazine subscriptions movies tv mp downloads music musical instruments office products patio , lawn garden pet supplies shoes software sports outdoors tools home improvement toys games video games watches i 've highlighted certain items that are emblematic of amazon 's ongoing megalomaniacal bid to be everything to everyone amazon is trying to out sears sears but we all know what 's happening to sears and it ai n't pretty amazon 's legacy empty strip malls everywhere amazon has n't been completely ineffective for every one of amazon 's fulfillment centers , there are probably five to ten staples stores out of business , ten or twenty barnes nobles stores gone , a dozen hardware stores gone , several pet supply stores , and maybe a toys r us or two to see the devastation wreaked by amazon , you have only to cruise the half empty strip malls in your local neighborhood amazon is sucking billion a year out of local economies , worldwide where amazon excels , of course , is in book reselling , e book publishing , and kindle sales although they are rumored to be taking a hit on every kindle fire sold this is where amazon 's monopoly power lies this is where they have the power to dominate , not merely decimate amazon also does well as a cloud services provider they can legitimately claim some high ground here but in patio , lawn , and garden equipment , sports equipment , kitchen and bath fixtures , and numerous other areas , they 're never going to have monopoly power in short , the parts of amazon that deal in electrons are doing well the parts that deal in protons are not doing so well that 's the crux of the matter one day , jeff bezos is going to have a bain capital moment and recognize that he 's in way over his big fat head there 'll be a sudden huge restructuring of the business big writeoffs will be taken apologies will be issued the stock price will plummet and amazon will emerge a much smaller but more profitable company either that , or if bezos continues to think like a megalomaniac amazon will simply hit the wall , hard and the smoking shards will blanket the earth i wonder if they sell hard hats ?
