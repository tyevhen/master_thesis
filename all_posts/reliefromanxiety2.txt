i'm sure for all of you who have experienced taking any type of medication , missing a day or two can really mess with your system , especially when it comes down to medication for your mental health , so this is your reminder to take your medication ! i have been on my mental health medication for around three to four years now and i can definitely tell when i have missed a day , or two , or three the problem is i often forget to leave it somewhere that i regularly see in the morning really , i should put the medication in a place where i will know that i will take it and i advise you to do that also ! for example , in the bathroom , near your hairbrush or even by your car keys when i miss my medication for a few days i experience dizziness , the feeling of being spaced out , lack of concentration , sickness and headaches i do n't feel that my mood changes that much unless i have missed my medication for a few days , not on purpose , but just out of forgetfulness after a few days i do notice a change in my mood , which can be quite severe i 'll often face increased anxiety and depression and even suicidal thoughts i remember the times when i have been extremely irrational and it has been scary because you feel completely out of control i wo n't go into detail of the exact experiences , but just remember to take the medication ! i think if i was to come off my medication more slowly , i would be able to control the reduction rather than going cold turkey and i think that is what causes the problems when medication is missed if this post reminds you of anything , please remember to take your medication as there is nothing to be ashamed of and missing medication for a long time can have adverse effects however , i am aware that certain medication itself can cause increased anxiety , depression and suicidal thoughts , but even so it is never advised to go completely cold turkey remember to follow your doctor 's advice what are your experiences ? amy x
