i posted a while back about janssen doing some research on why people with schizophrenia stop taking their antipsychotic medications they partnered with the national association of social workers to conduct a survey as to which patients were unlikely to comply with taking their medications a group of social workers and academics was unimpressed with the science behind said survey and that the nasw was willing to accept a bribe , er , donation from janssen in order to push this survey on its membership in a related note , at the american psychiatric association convention , a press release featuring dr john kane a janssen consultant with a monetary investment in janssen said that the main reason physicians cite for patients not complying with their medication is poor insight into illness i do n't know if poor efficacy or side effect burden was even mentioned by this survey these results came from a survey designed by who else ? janssen what am i getting at ? well , we 've got two related surveys , one given to social workers , the other to physicians both of them emphasize that patients tend to not comply with their schizophrenia medications well , phew , janssen , whose patent on oral risperdal is about to expire , has the patent for an injectable form of risperdal risperdal consta , which wo n't expire for a while so , they send out these surveys under the guise of research , but the point is far from research we already know people do n't generally enjoy taking antipsychotics the point is marketing people do n't comply with their medications , so we have to give it to them in injectable , long acting format so that their compliance with treatment will be acceptable
