in tracking stats from this blog i 've noticed that my best of posts are more popular than the current ones i intersperse in this ongoing review perhaps they are more interesting , or better written , i do n't know one thing is certain , however depression has a large audience , however terrible it may be , and in my writing about the experience i have granted relief to some , many who have written me privately also , we 've now broached , where i am finally delivered from a two year depression it does n't get that good yet nevertheless , here are past testaments to the struggle from kilorats my mind is blank from crying crying empties the mind and exhausts the body it is a blessing under normal circumstances but in my case more of a reflexive seizure i cried through most of my appointment with my shrink today i think i conveyed the sense of utter hopelessness i experience i have withdrawn from my pain medication and am not drinking , the former at my suggestion and the latter at his insistence whether his insistence is enough for my resistance is another matter i fear not drinking how else can i numb my mind at night in order to watch basketball on television , literally the only time in my day when i feel almost neutral ? in my present state it is hard to stay on one task for any amount of time i try to read but find myself reading the same paragraph over and over i am blank the pressure will heat up again , however , after my brain begins to castigate me for all my failures and derelictions until a lump rises in my throat and the faucets come on again i did manage to throw out the christmas tree last night being just a local redwood sapling it was rather sparse , but it never shed a single needle while it was up i threw it out from the deck out back , and we stepson derek and daughter sarah put our hands on it to transfer the past year 's sins onto its innocent bark as a convenient scapegoat afterwords i launched it like a spear out into the woods where it will feed the nitrogen cycle i ran across a curious article today in which it was shown that men who cease religious activities are actually at lower risk for anxiety and depression , while women who cease religious activities are more likely to suffer from them they think it might have to do with different social networking styles i thought it funny in light of my discussion with friend eric about christianity and my depression religion is toxic for me in this state , something he has difficulty understanding wait that little possessive adjective my is part of my problem i want this to be your depression , too ! i should not hog all its glory for myself you , too , can help carry the burden so if any of you wish to undertake this , please write me and i 'll instruct you in the fine art of breakdowns chemistry aside , there are some ways to achieve depression without being born into the disease , but it takes a big commitment when you get as bad as i am now , the main survival tool is to accept your depression like a winter tree , think of yourself as dormant , not dead oh , you feel dead , you feel worse than dead it 's a living hell no one has described it better than jesus , who said of hell there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth , except that he left out the anxiety part simply put , the emotion of despair includes sadness , fear and anger , the anger usually self directed in psychiatric terms this constitutes dysphoria what surprises me about this depression has been its gradations at times i can laugh , at other times not twice i had temporary responses to medications in the past when the worm turned it was sudden and for a long time i can remember distinctly noticing the beauty of a fern while hiking during another depression , and afterwards realizing that in that moment of aesthetic appreciation i had flipped out of my depression nothing had been beautiful up to that moment for the longest time suddenly i was well this is why i do n't get psychotherapy it just makes the disease worse , since the complaints i bring to the therapist are mainly biological in nature i wrote a poem about this once , below glass giraffe when my soul was sanded so raw the capillaries could n't even seep , i questioned the value of pain you must experience your feelings of abandonment until you are comfortable with them , you said when my suicidal doppelganger turned me inside out , pulling my anus through my mouth , you said , now that you are stripped of defenses you have a better chance of changing them when i called you up one weekend to say i was terrified of inanimate objects like doorknobs and tea kettles , you said , stay with it globalized fear indicates a necessary therapeutic regression finally the antidepressants kicked in and i felt like myself when i left you gave me another card since therapy was unfinished and i might be back on your couch or another s i gazed at your office figurines , crystal leopards and pewter trolls , porcelain ballerinas and kachina dolls , and imagined the souls of all your patients trapped inside them those , who like me , sought relief through words when only medicines would do i could have been the glass giraffe kilorats , ce from a temporary reversal a pacific storm note the oxymoron has caused a power outage at our place for five days , typical for the mendocino coast in winter thus i have not had an opportunity to blog since i last saw my doctor and lo and behold ! from the depths of darkness a medication adjustment has raised me back to the world of normality for five days now i quit drinking any alcohol and insisted going off of my long acting oral morphine for my chronic disk pain , as either of these could possibly be contributing factors to my unresponsiveness and in tears , telling my doctor what method of suicide i 'd prefer while promising no intent , i said , ca n't we try a stimulant ? so , the doctor put me back on abilify , which had stopped working , and added adderall , a mixture of amphetamine salts i took them the same day and felt better immediately but what do i mean by better ? my depressive thoughts quit circling like sharks in the aquarium of my mind my body felt normal , with normal energy i had hope , i began to think of future plans my crying spells stopped just like that ! amazing my fear is , of course , that this new cocktail , like the two others that worked then ceased working , will cease working as well , or that i 'll develop tolerance or something but maybe , just maybe , the third time is a charm it 's a strange sensation , however , for one 's body and brain to feel normal while the memory of the last nineteen months of horror remains in the center of my chest like a rubble lined pit from a nuclear blast , my heart being ground zero my last post was signed with seven kilorats that 's the highest i 've recorded in this blog , though i 've been lower than that in previous depressions i feel almost plastic in a way , the mood switch being so sudden and my heart still dragging behind me like an anchor i am aware of the former emptiness in my chest but do not acutely experience it my unutterable sadness suddenly feels like a phantom limb suddenly the idea of a god of love seems imaginable to me my religious torment has lifted and in thinking of my correspondence with my christian friend , i have to confess before god and man my disease is more important to me than my religion i ca n't help it if my disease is not controlled i ca n't do faith except in a hollow intellectual sense i ca n't pretend to be more virtuous than this as a man dying of thirst thinks only of water , so the severely depressed thinks only of annihilation , of an end he is beyond hope of getting better but determined , at least in my case , not to kill himself because he remembers , as through a fog , recovering from previous depressions one thing i did to mark this miracle was to reverse my garuda a garuda is an indonesian mask carved in the form of an eagle faced gargoyle , said to be the eagle who is the mount of the god , vishnu , in the hindu pantheon it is meant to keep evil spirits out of a household but i had hung it above my front door facing inwards when we moved into our new place on april , , the day my depression began as a visible sign of improvement , as an incarnation of hope , i have now hung the garuda on the wall facing the door now he looks out at the world and protects me and mine what was best about this change is that my daughter , sarah , was visiting from la and near the end of her stay she got her papa back ! and kathleen got her craig back and i have myself back , though it will take time for me to trust the sensation of being me for those interested in a longer meditation on brain chemistry and personality , i recommend listening to prozac we are all much more chemical than otherwise if you were spared the gene for this devastating illness , you could never give proper thanks for not having it and i am glad for you if you suffer , all i can say is hold on and keep seeking help that 's all i 've done i'm tempted to sign this kiloneutral but am afraid to make such a claim for so short a period of recovery let us hold today 's labeling in abeyance gratefully , ce
