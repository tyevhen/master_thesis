no , it 's not finished yet i managed to stay productive until a m , after which point i was just sleeping sitting up so i allowed myself to go to bed a couple hours i set three alarms , slept for three hours and pushed snooze for two hours more to the certain chagrin of my roommates i 've been working all day , but to no avail on the bright side , the minute thing has been a lifesaver i apologize if this blog is not up to my normal level of witty banter , but i actually am more concerned about my thesis than blogging today
