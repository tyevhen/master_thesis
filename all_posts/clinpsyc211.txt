i recently posted about dr rita pal , who is under investigation by the general medical council in the uk there have now been comments written regarding the post , and i suspect the number will continue to rise anonymous commenters have made several posts challenging the veracity of dr pal 's assertion that she is being investigated for the ludicrous charge of linking to a secret document from her blog other comments have attacked dr pal from other angles dr pal has refuted the allegations of the anonymous commenters vigorously my original post is here and more in depth reporting can be found at furious seasons and the scientific misconduct blog , as well as at the register , where the story was initially reported i 've not been very impressed with some comments , such as the one that simply accused dr pal of being borderline i 've got a pretty open comment policy obviously , but if we 're going to post comments , let 's make them something other than name calling some of the posts have been regarding the lisa blakemore brown issue , on which my original opinion remains unchanged
