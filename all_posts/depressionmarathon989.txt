the weekend is concluding , and i am briefly awake that 's not been normal this weekend i 've mostly been asleep the past two days have looked a lot like this wake up eat cereal watch the tour de france sleep eat more cereal sleep look at my housework sleep look at my unmowed lawn sleep watch tv sleep think about making something for dinner eat cereal instead sleep watch tv sleep as you may have guessed , this is not a satisfying pattern in which to be i'm hitting a wall every task feels monumental nothing seems interesting people are becoming painful i am heavy i am slow i am isolating this is a scary place to be i think the chronic fatigue is getting the best of me i feel my mood sliding down i feel the abyss rising up i am afraid i'm sinking into the hole but i'm trying my hardest to stay afloat despite myself , i somehow got out for a bike ride yesterday and a run today i'm really not sure how i got out the door neither activity felt good i'm sure neither looked good , but i got out there gotta give myself credit for that i'm trying hard to stay afloat tomorrow , i have to get back to the world i'm dreading work with people becoming painful and my brain moving slow , work could be long and excruciating i guess i better bring my life preserver
