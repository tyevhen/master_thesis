jama has an article this week by bankole johnson , et al , showing the anticonvulsant topamax topiramate to be effective in reducing percentage of heavy drinking days , from in the placebo group to in the topamax group this was a double blind , placebo controlled , week study , using study participants dose range was mg daily side effects included tingling sensations , changes in taste , loss of appetite , and impairments in concentration mean daily dose was mg day they started with mg d for week , then mg day for week , and increasing by mg weekly in divided morning and night doses to the maximum of mg d this may be a good approach to helping some people reduce drinking , especially folks who might also have bipolar disorder , which is sometimes also treated with topamax our study had limitations first , while the pattern of adverse events was similar to that found in our previous study , the more rapid titration was associated with decreased study adherence with taking the medication previously , when topiramate was titrated over an additional weeks ie , over weeks rather than weeks , retention rates were similar between the topiramate and placebo groups clinical sites least familiar with topiramate experienced more difficulties with retention , whereas completion rates among some experienced groups approached data not shown we advise clinicians to use the slower titration schedule and to provide participants with focused education on managing emergent adverse events to maximize adherence with taking the medication second , as with most clinical trials in the alcohol dependence field , enrolled participants have to meet criteria enabling the conduct of a safe study because this cohort is often relatively healthier and perhaps more homogeneous than the general population of all those seeking treatment for alcohol dependence , our ability to generalize without restriction from this trial to clinical practice is limited third , this study did not have a follow up period , so we could not determine whether , how many , and at what interval participants would have relapsed following medication withdrawal nevertheless , with respect to how people fare , on average , following treatment for alcoholism in a clinical trial , a meta analysis of recent studies has shown that , even after a single treatment event , most can show substantial reductions in drinking up to year afterward our finding in this study that topiramate is a safe and consistently efficacious medication for treating alcohol dependence is scientifically and clinically important alcoholism ranks third and fifth on the us and global burdens of disease , respectively discovering pharmacological agents such as topiramate that improve drinking outcomes can make a major contribution to global health because topiramate pharmacotherapy can be paired with a brief intervention deliverable by nonspecialist health practitioners , a next step would be to examine its efficacy in community practice settings
