i'm inching ever closer to the austin marathon this sunday puck and i just came in from an easy run with by minute pick ups i felt great ! my legs felt great my mood is good things are looking good the fatigue from last week seems to have passed i'm quite pleased by that ! i'm getting restless to get to texas now the sun has been shining here for the last couple days it 's been a welcome relief from the gray of the past few months it 's been so nice to run with warm sun on my face even though i also end up with mud covering me below my knees puck is sound asleep in the sun on the living room floor right now i think this warmth helps both of our moods if you 're looking for an update on the dating scene , see the addendum at the end of the previous post i figure someday , somewhere , a handsome , financially secure , no drama man will walk into my life until then , i will continue to enjoy being single after all , there are many advantages to walking this path alone and someday i may also know the advantages of walking it with another it 's a short post today that 's what happens when life moves smoothly along i leave for texas on friday i will be sure and keep you updated once there and look for my marathon results on sunday until next time , carry on , friends
