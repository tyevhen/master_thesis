hello friends ! my parents came to visit us on saturday and my mom brought me these treasures they were all mine when i was an infant and she 's saved them for me all these years ! i had no idea ! what a thrill and surprise this was ! the yellow blanket with matching sweater and bonnet were all knitted for me she ca n't remember who made them though and the shade of yellow is the exact color of the crib bedding ! i 've been looking for a little sweater like this , so i'm happy it 's here now the pink and blue blanket was knitted by my great grandmother little p 's great great grandmother when i was an infant and she died not too long later it 's ultra soft and i'm excited to use it my mom was named after her grandmother and it 's so lovely to pass down these special priceless things that she touched the white and orange stork blanket was knitted by my mom 's friend and neighbor just after my birth the front is covered with all of my birth status information like a birth announcement on a blanket pretty cool to see , and little p will get to use it now too and everything is machine washable dry able so we do n't have to worry about damaging the fabric i love blankets and think hand made knitted ones are so special , unique , and lovely and great heirlooms ! i do n't think you can ever have too many thanks again mom , what a nice surprise ! save
