oh , i have to say , last week i was away for the week and saw a t shirt that said , please , lord , help me to be the person my dog thinks i am i thought of buying it but actually , i'm not that sure my dog thinks that well of me , and he 's not the most articulate of persnickety and temperamental little creatures today , i saw the sign above on facebook , and i chuckled it 's probably not the most politically correct of things to smile at , and i am not always the most politically correct of people , though it seems important to at least try on a psychiatry blog , so here , i at least try i thought i 'd give it up for a day and share this with you if you hate it , please forgive me in other news , days until the election is over and there is an important article in the washington post on why more middle aged white women are dying of accidental drug overdoses not surprisingly part of the reason is that people get sleeping pills or anxiety medications benzodiezapines and take them together with opiates for pain a deadly combination so please , warn your patients about the dangers of respiratory depression with this combination like you would warn them not to drink alcohol with benzos and know that if you 're striving to be the person your psychiatrist medicates you to be , that person is alive and thriving
