day in the week of the idzie i started getting enthusiastic about the idea of unschooling when i was or , and i actually met other unschoolers in real life for the first time when i was and went to not back to school camp i think i expected everything to change instantly that i d magically become more outgoing and make a ton of new friends in one fell swoop , and i was a bit disappointed when that didn t happen but i did really like the atmosphere of camp , and i did make some new , tentative friendships and as i continued to make my way into the unschooling community by going to a couple of conferences with my mother and sister , and going to not back to school camp again the next year , i started realizing that , slowly but surely , i was making quite a few friends i found myself keeping in touch with those friends , even though they lived far away , and gaining a hell of a lot of confidence along the way i learned that maybe i was someone worth being friends with , after all , and i learned that there were a lot of unschoolers i very much wanted to get to know better now , the unschooling community isn t the only one i feel i need in my life i was rather surprised when i first started going to unschooling events by how non radical many unschoolers are i guess i d assumed that because questioning the schooling system lead me to questioning so much else , that that would be the experience of others , as well and it is ! just not as many others as maybe i d first thought this isn t meant in any way as a criticism , just an honest reflection of my thoughts regardless , the people i choose to surround myself with now are unschoolers , anarchists , radicals , queers , hippies , pagans , and other odd folk and i m using odd here in the most complementary sense possible ! everyone will feel pulled to find different communities , but all of us do need community it s the finding of it that can be difficult read more at the unschooler experiment you might also like i get my very own week , courtesy of the unschooler against the grain listen to the podcast on the favorite unschooling posts on this blog of normalcy is for squares the unschooler experiment linkwithin
