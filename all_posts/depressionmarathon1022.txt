the technician told me i slept really well i only know that i woke up several times feeling as if i was suffocating from the c pap machine forced air rushing from the machine into my nose made exhaling very difficult eventually , my nose got so stuffy i was actually suffocating i stopped the sleep study at that point , which was am this morning the technician insisted i slept really well perhaps she 's right after all , i'm still awake after the first study , without the c pap , i came home and went to bed i do n't feel the need to go to bed now , so perhaps i did sleep better i'm not sure about wearing a c pap every night , though , as my general impression was that i was uncomfortable then again , if c pap is the cure to my fatigue , the choice to use it will become quite simple i'm glad the testing is done , and i'm looking forward to discussing everything with my doc later this week nothing to do now but wait for the results i 'll keep you posted
