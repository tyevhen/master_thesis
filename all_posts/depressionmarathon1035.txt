in a few hours , a woman i watched win local races as a girl will line up with a very real chance to win the boston marathon it 's been many years since an american woman won this historic race , and i'm quite certain a native minnesotan has never won it although dick beardsley came awful close so i'm rooting for kara goucher today she 's worked her butt off , stayed healthy , and deserves every success she achieves go , kara , go ! win boston !
