shocking as it might sound , leprosy continues to strike over , persons per year worldwide , making it as much of a health problem as cholera or yellow fever one of the oldest known infectious diseases , leprosy became the first disease to be causally linked to bacteria when hansen made his famous discovery of the connection to mycobacterium leprae in ever since then , scientists have been trying to grow m leprae in the lab , to no avail like most environmental isolates , m leprae defies attempts at pure culture the only way to grow it in the lab is to infect mice or armadillos , where it has a doubling time of days , the longest known generation time of any bacterium traditionally , it has been assumed that the difficulty in growing m leprae in pure culture is due to the organism 's complex nutritional requirements in humans , the organism is an obligate intracellular parasite that takes up residency in the schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system there is no doubt considerable truth to this assumption , but the reason for the organism 's fastidious nutritional requirements was n't fully known until cole et al showed that half the bacterium 's genome is inoperative and undergoing decay genomic sequencing revealed that m leprae has only three quarters the dna content of its quite robust cousin , m tuberculosis , and of m leprae 's , or so remaining genes , only , are fully functional the rest are pseudogenes pseudogenes are genes that have become inactivated through loss of start codons , loss of promoter regions , introduction of spurious stop codons , introduction of frameshift errors , or through other causes almost all organisms contain pseudogenes in their dna human dna reportedly contains over , pseudogenes the leprosy bacterium , however , is unique in having approximately half its genome tied up in pseudogenes once a gene becomes a pseudogene , it is effectively useless baggage junk dna and continues on a long path of deterioration evolutionary theory predicts that such genes will eventually be lost from the genome , since the carrying cost of keeping them puts the organism at a disadvantage , energetically but the curious thing about m leprae is that it 's a hoarder it not only holds onto its useless genes , it actually transcribes upwards of of them in fact , a recent study of year old m leprae dna recovered from medieval skeletons , comparing the medieval version of the organism 's genome with the genome of today 's m leprae , found that pseudogenes are highly conserved in the bacterium the fact that the bacterium actually transcribes many of its pseudogenes and does n't lose them over time is striking , to say the least , and suggests that the transcription of certain genes or pseudogenes is resulting in mrnas that silence other , more deleterious genes it could be that m leprae ca n't be grown in culture because when certain combinations of nutrients are presented to it , the nutrients up regulate deleterious nonsense genes in otherwise normal operons or down regulate important silencers , directly or indirectly williams et al found that many m leprae pseudogenes are located in the middle of operons and are transcribed via fortuitous read through various scenarios are possible much work remains to be done in the meantime , i could n't help doing a little desktop science to characterize m leprae 's defective genes problem further i went to http genomevolution org coge organismview pl and entered mycobacterium leprae br in the organism name field in the genome information box , if you click the click for features link , you can see that genes are labeled cds meaning , these are the operative , non defective genes while a separate line item shows an utterly astounding genes as pseudogenes addendum the fasta file at genomevolution org contains duplicates the actual pseudogene count , it turns out , is , not but still , is a huge number of pseudogenes the dna seqs links on the right side of that page allow you to download the fasta sequences for the respective gene groupings these are simple text files containing the base sequences a , t , g , and c for the coding strands of the genes i wrote a few lines of javascript to analyze the base compositions of the genes and pseudogenes , and what i noticed immediately is that the base composition differs for the two groups base content genes content pseudogenes a g c t the g c content for the normal genes averages , whereas for the pseudogenes it 's a typical g c value for other members of the genus mycobacterium is thus , it 's clear that not only the pseudogenes but the normal genes of m leprae have drifted in the direction of more a t this has been noted before by cole et al and others what 's perhaps less obvious is that purine content a g has shifted from in the normal genes to in the pseudogenes bear in mind we 're looking at data for one strand of dna the so called coding or message strand clearly , there is a tendency for pseudogenes to regress to the mean but the shift in purine concentration is particularly interesting , because it indicates that purine usage in normal gene coding regions is perhaps non randomly elevated the shift from to in a g content may not seem particularly striking on its own , but the difference , it turns out , is highly significant you can see why in the following graph base composition of normal genes in m leprae total purines vs g c by codon base position n red dots are for base one , gold dots are for base two , blue dots are for base the wobble base click to enlarge see text for discussion to make this graph , i looked at the dna of the coding regions of normal genes and determined the average purine content as well as the g c content for positions one , two , and three of all codons as you can see , the purine content relative to the g c content segregates non randomly according to codon base position the red dots represent base one , the gold or brown dots represent base two , and the blue dots represent base three often called the wobble base , for historical reasons not unexpectedly , the greatest g c shift occurs in base three as is usually the case what 's perhaps more surprising is the clear preference for purines in base one the red cluster centers at y plus or minus standard deviation this means that on average , position one of a codon is occupied by a purine a or g over of the time this is actually quite typical of codons in most organisms i 've looked at over , bacterial species so far , and in all of them , purines accumulate at codon base one maybe in a future post , i 'll present more data to this effect base two segregates out as having a g c content significantly below the organism 's total genome g c content and centers on y median plus or minus sd now compare the above graph with a similar graph for m leprae 's pseudogenes base composition of m leprae pseudogenes by codon position n again , red dots are for base one , gold are for base two , blue are for base three click to enlarge see text for discussion here , it 's evident that base compositions for all three codon positions overlap significantly the fact that the codon positions are no longer clearly defined in their spatial representation on this graph is consistent with widespread frameshift mutations in the dna , causing bases that would normally be in position one or two or three to be in some other position , randomly hence we can say , with some confidence , on the basis of these graphs , that many if not most of the junk genes in m leprae harbor frameshift mutations the question of which came first frameshift mutations , or silencing of genes followed by frameshifts is still open but we know for certain frameshifts are indeed rampant in the m leprae pseudogenome exactly how or why m leprae accumulated so many frameshift mutations and then kept hoarding the mutated genes is unknown as i said earlier , much work remains to be done note graphs were produced using the excellent service at zunzun com hand editing of svg graphs before conversion to png enabled easy modification of the data point colors in a text editor data points were plotted with opacity so that areas of high overlap are more apparent visually with the piling of data points on top of data points bioinformaticists
