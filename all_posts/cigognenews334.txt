there is an old saying give a man a fish and he eats for a day teach a man to fish and he eats forever that is what we do in our therapy we try to take all of the mystery out of our therapy we explain all our techniques and theories to patients so that they can learn how to do it therefore they can leave therapy with sufficient tools to carry on helping themselves our goal is to make the patient independent as soon as possible , rather than enhancing his dependence by keeping the techniques of therapy hidden it is , after all , the patient s brain and body we don t want his feelings to go unnoticed , and we don t want them to go on un experienced but once he gains access to feelings he has the first technique for making himself well there is always a real need for dependence in therapy for a time , but that is to be discouraged as the patient can stop acting out being the child who needs a daddy or mommy once this need for protection and guidance is felt we want her to stand on her own feet she should look to herself for answers and not us she is the master of her unconscious and knows it better than we do let me give an example nearly all new research finds that the earliest months and years of our lives leave a lasting impression in my language it is called the imprint if we don t know about that we cannot successfully help anyone for example , a new study finds that infant stress affects the teenage brain if we ignore infant stress we will never understand brain problems as we grow up see nature , nov , also found in nature neuroscience , check http www sciencedaily com releases htm this study examined several hundred children from birth to early adulthood they found that four year olds exposed to chronic stress arguing parents , divorce , death of a loved one , have high levels of the stress hormones cortisol in their systems we found that , as well , in our beginning patients these high levels correlated strongly with aggression , impulsivity and other related behavioral problems these researcher also scanned the brains of eighteen year olds who were part of the original study they had weaker connections to feeling centers such as the amygdala there is much more to the study but what is clear is how early stress affects our feeling capacity and in our navigating the world and we see how all this plays into such problems as attention deficit so with patients we want them to understand their feelings and how it affects their learning ability and with their knowledge to understand and control their inability to concentrate they learn to cure themselves and they learn to make themselves better they no longer rush to the doctor for answers they have the answers they need besides no one else knows more about you than you nothing is more informative than your own feelings they teach us what feelings drove what act out or act in what makes our migraines come on or what raises blood pressure feelings inform us about why the heart races and breathing gets shallow they explain why the tantrums and crying jags why the sudden terror or panic attacks no more mysteries no more feeling helpless before the onslaught of anxiety ain t that great ?
