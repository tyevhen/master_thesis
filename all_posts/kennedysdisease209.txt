as the muscles atrophy , most of us living with kennedy s disease become more sedentary with this lifestyle change , we also find it easier to gain weight and more difficult to lose it from personal experience , i know that if i am carrying around just a few extra pounds , my exercise program becomes more difficult and just getting up from a chair requires a lot more effort even more important , i notice that my breathing is more labored especially when walking or after eating another way to look at the impact of excess weight on those of us with kennedy s disease is to consider what it would be like carrying around one or two ten pound bags of flour all day not only do you wear down faster , but every activity requires more effort your heart also has to work harder to compensate for the weight when i notice i am a little overweight , i immediately try to reduce my daily rations until i am back to my fighting weight i find that it is easier to lose a couple of pounds than to lose five or ten pounds because of this , i regularly monitor my weight to make certain i do not have to go on a diet there are hundreds perhaps thousands of dietary programs and books , but i like to keep things simple for me , there are a few keys for losing weight and a few others for maintaining a reasonable comfortable weight ten keys to lose weight make the decision to start losing weight today you have to want to lose the weight or you might as well not even try set a simple , achievable goal i need to get my head in the right place before starting negative thoughts produce negative results once i believe i can lose the weight , losing it becomes a whole lot easier your goal can be as simple as losing one pound a week visualize yourself at the lighter weight imagine what life will be like when you are , or pounds lighter how will you feel ? how will others see you ? every day see yourself healthier and happier drink plenty of water especially right before eating water is a temporary filler if you drink a glass of water before you sit down to eat , you will feel more full even if you eat less sodas or other calorie filled drinks are not a substitute for water do not be too strict about what or what not to eat if i am overly aggressive in trying to select only certain foods to eat , i am setting myself up for failure for me , the best course of action is a reduction in the daily total intake and a reduction in fatty and snack foods i also focus on eating more healthy foods during this process focus is the key word for me not obsession exercise every day no excuses this does not have to be anything ridiculous , just regular exercises that fit your abilities and temporarily raise your metabolism besides , it is difficult to stuff your mouth when exercising eat a healthy breakfast you do not want to skip the most important meal of the day skipping meals just makes you more hungry my philosophy is to eat a generous breakfast , a reasonable lunch and a light dinner cut out between meal snack snacking is a bad habit that we acquire at an early age unless the snacks are healthy vegetables and fruit , these between meal treats just add on the pounds today , i rarely snack and when i do , i reduce my food intake for the remainder of the day i brush my teeth and floss after dinner to help remind me that i am done eating for the day larger quantities do not always mean greater satisfaction this is something that really helped me there are always going to be times when i want something to eat when i do feel the need , i find that two to four cashews , for example , are just as satisfying as a whole handful the same strategy applies to chips , cookies , or anything else develop a support network if you a losing a few pounds , this is not as important if , however , you have a major weight loss in mind , solicit the support of friends and loved ones a few words of encouragement can go a long way when you feel yourself slipping six keys to maintain your desired weight note that several are similar to those outlined above be mindful of what you eat often we eat and not even know we are eating eating while involved in another activity such as watching tv is not being mindful of what you are eating maintain a regular exercise program this does not have to be anything ridiculous , just regular exercises that fit your abilities and temporarily raise your metabolism besides , it is difficult to stuff your mouth when exercising eat a healthy breakfast you do not want to skip the most important meal of the day skipping meals just makes you more hungry eat a generous breakfast , a reasonable lunch and a light dinner reduce the number of sodas and other high calorie drinks water is a good substitute so is unsweetened tea and coffee in moderation cut out between meal snacks unless they are healthy vegetables and fruit redirect your thoughts away from in between meal snacks if you feel stressed and want to snack comfort food , meditate or practice deep breathing if in feel lonely or unloved , seek out family and friends including your pets also , brush your teeth and floss after dinner to help remind yourself that you are done eating for the day larger quantities do not always mean greater satisfaction when you feel the need and cannot redirect your thoughts , try just taking a couple of bites of something two to four cashews , for example i believe you will find it just as satisfying as a whole handful weight control for me is mind over matter matter , in this instance , has mass and occupies space i e , a large belly if i am mindful of what i am eating , the pounds the matter in this case will disappear i would be interested in what works for you please share your weight loss secrets in the comments section below
