my family got some very bad news yesterday if you 're friends with me on facebook , you 'll probably know what that news was i 'd love to blog about it as well , since to me , blogging is a great outlet , but before putting that news on the net for anyone to view , i think i should check with the person who 's bad news it was so for now , just know that my family is going through a bit of a rough patch , but i'm doing okay , and keeping some mental distance when i need to think about it , i do , but otherwise , i'm distracting myself , and just going on with life how i normally do i could write 'what unschooling looked like today' , but i came to a realization just a little while ago there is no 'what unschooling looked like today' there 's only what life looked like today learning is living , and living is learning , so why differentiate between the two ? if i'm living , i'm learning , and obviously if i'm learning , i'm living ! so what did life look like today ? so far , i read a bunch of blogs , mainly on unschooling i read some of endgame , and thanks to that book , i decided to take a walk i love where i live i love being so close to the water so that 's where i walked , down to the water it 's a bright day today although as i speak the sun is starting to go down , and fairly warm , with the snow starting to melt however , the wind is strong , and makes it feel much colder it was a spur of the moment decision to go for a walk , so of course i did n't even bother changing out of my pj 's before going out ! i simply put on my coat , wrapped myself up in my stripey wool scarf , slung my camera over my shoulder , and started out i wanted to show you some pictures i took , but blogger is n't cooperating i walked along , huddled in my coat , pretty much just looking at the ground , and in that position i could n't help but notice how all of the snow was glittering it was melting a bit today but since it was still cold , there was lots of ice marvelous , glittery , slippery ice i stopped to take a picture of a random chunk of ice on the street , and i'm very happy with how that shot turned out i 'll use that shot for my photography blog today , and i 'll post all the pictures that i wanted to in a separate post when blogger starts working properly as i walked , i let my mind drift i listened to the cars go by , and the wind passing by , and saw the beautiful sunlight streaming down when i got to the water , i had to navigate the ice before i could get to the shore and the patch of grass actual grass ! where the snow had melted just as i got near the shore , the wind suddenly picked up , making my loose pajama pants billow like crazy , and the leaves that had somehow managed to cling to a dead branch rustle wildly what a lovely welcome ! everything was ice bright , and i quickly started snapping pictures note to self next time i want to take pictures when it 's cold out , i should find proper gloves , instead of wearing a ratty old pair of mittens that the wind cuts right through my hands got pretty cold pretty fast , so i decided to head back just as i started to walk away , the wind gusted once more , pushing me away from the water i love the wind ! i was so lost in thought on the way home that i actually walked past my house ! i do n't see how anyone could ever not love life , when there 's crunchy ice to be cracked , rocks to be kicked , wind to be raced with , clouds to be watched this was one of those winter days that lets you know that spring is on the way sure , there will probably be more snowfalls , and there will definitely be many more cold days , but spring is still on the horizon , moving steadily closer everything is just so damn wonderful i picked up the mail on my way in , and discovered that my yukon travel booklet had arrived ! i now have travel information from new mexico , newfoundland , bc , and the yukon so far , the places i want to go to most are newfoundland and bc i find it funny that i literally chose the two places that are farthest appart one on the eat coast of canada , one on the west ! and that 's pretty much it i continue to read endgame , and look at the travel info my family has decided we need to go to more unschooling conferences , and so far we 're looking mainly at the northeastern , we shine , and toronto unschooling conferences cost is a big issue , and so far we shine seems o be the best for that i know that most unschoolers who read my blog are west coasters , but i still have to ask , is anyone else looking into those conferences ? it would be awesome to run into people i know online ! d peace , idzie you might also like the unschoolers winter waterpark gathering unschoolers winter waterpark gathering going to the uwwg ! unschooling gatherings linkwithin
