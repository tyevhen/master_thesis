week sunil frances jesse adele week sunil frances jesse adele week sunil frances jesse adele week sunil frances jesse adele week sunil frances jesse adele paul goes to a new psychiatrist because he wants a prescription for ambien he ran out three days ago and it 's pm on friday and he ca n't wait until monday when he 's scheduled to see a neurologist the new shrink , we learn from her diploma on the wall , has an m d , a ph d and she 's a psychoanalyst by my count , that makes her about , but paul is quick to repeatedly comment on how young she is i'm sure whatever grade you 're in , you 've learned to write paul wants a script , that 's it and he came to a psychoanalyst for it ? he 's hostile , irritable , angry , and condescending he gets annoyed when she asks him what dose he 's kept awake by a dream , but he 's been analyzed by gina and he knows what everything is about and he wo n't tell her the dream , only that it relates to his patients , his frustration with his work being with a patient is like being two mice trapped in a glue trap , and his certainty that he has parkinson 's disease oh , but when you hear how he takes extra ambien in the middle of the night , it 's kind of got me wondering if he has n't misdiagnosed himself and is n't in withdrawal during the day , but i suppose we 'll find that out next week my guess is that paul 's tremor is psychogenic but again oh , yes , clinkshrink reminds me he is a tv character and not a real person gina , his old analyst whom he used to fight with miserably , has written a novel and paul has brought it with him got it in a book store on the way to the appointment and he wishes he 'd asked for a bag he gets defensive when adele questions his treatment with gina she was your teacher , your supervisor , your analyst , and your couples therapist ? he is offended , after all what does this newbie pipsqueak know ? adele apologizes twice and she 's extremely tolerant of paul 's patronizing and demanding demeanor regarding the ambien prescription he 's clearly not a patient , not interested in being evaluated or getting treatment recommendations ah , he knows it all , there 's nothing anyone can offer he 's here to purchase a prescription and he 's not even going to play the game of being polite paul predictably softens as the episode goes on and talks a little about himself adele ends the session by telling him the door is always open to him something gina said she 'should' say but would n't he comments on what a difficult patient he is and adele says she had n't notices , but alas , adele is lying
