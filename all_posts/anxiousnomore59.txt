i have had an epiphany i am so excited to share it with you , i ca n't stand it i just hope you like the idea as much as i do i used to work in an office hours a week and would struggle with my anxiety every day in my cubicle i did n't want everyone in the office to know about my personal health so i would post pictures of random things that no one else would know the meaning of but me for example , i used to have a picture of a footprint in the sand this was to remind me whenever i saw it of the affirmation i can take as small a step forward as i choose there is no need to push myself everytime i glanced at the picture i would think of that i had a sticker of an upper case r on my computer monitor this was to remind me of the positive affirmation i respect and believe in myself more than other people 's opinions this worked great while i worked in the office then as a work at home mom , i would post the affirmations around my bedroom and bathroom however i found it embarrasing if any guests came over if they saw it so this idea is a way to carry those thoughts with you all the time at home , at work , and on the go simply wear them as a necklace ! i have created these really cool hand stamped customized washer necklaces that are really popular in the crafting community it started out as putting my child 's name on one and making some as christmas gifts with family names and birthdates then i started to think about other things i could stamp into them and i thought of phrases that could help with anxiety such as be still calm believe at peace serenity just to name a few but really , anything can be stamped into these necklaces initials , numbers , phrases these can be worn underneath clothing for privacy , or they can be as stand outish as you want with additional charms and beads i only have one picture on here to give you an idea of what i am talking about , but there are so many other styles that i can do as well so here 's the thing i decided i would share these with anyone that is interested i have set up an etsy shop and will be posting these necklaces for sale in the very , very , very near future i will probably only post a few to see what kind of interest there is so if there is something you hold dear to you that helps you find hope , encouragement , or valuable affirmations , let me know and i can make it for you all the details will be in the shop but i wanted to let you know it was coming so you could swirl the idea around in your head i hope everyone has a happy new year ! are you thinking of resolutions that you want to do for ? i know i have i am a believer in them do they work for you or stress you out ? if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email
