hey there ! so , here 's the story i teased yesterday monday was a horrible day it sucked ass paige was in tantrum city and i was exhausted and cranky by the end i wo n't go into particulars but you know the drill chris came home from work and said let 's go someplace fun and silly i 'll take you to friendly 's for a simple dinner and ice cream i felt too tired to go , but thought it might be fun and redeem some part of the day off we went so , we waited forever to get seated even though there were tons of open seats anyway , we ordered our drinks and waited after a time , i heard the waitress approach and i heard chris go oh crap ! just then , a felt a glass of soda land in my lap and the other splashed over my leg huge glasses of soda full of ice emptied all over me i never saw it coming because she approached from behind and the tray wobbled thus sending the drinks over my right shoulder and into my lap my entire sweater and pants were soaked through i was dripping and shivering and had ice inside my pants my almost six month along belly was shivering i just sat there and said well , this day has sucked so bad and that was the cherry on top the girl was a teen and it was her first day i then felt bad for her , so i told her everything would be fine and these things happen all the time i even made up a story about how i 'd done it during my waitressing days needless to say , i did n't have a change of clothes with me but i wanted my grilled cheese , dammit ! so , we sat there i was so embarrassed because the whole restaurant had stopped to stare and gawk but at least everyone was looking sympathetic too bad the girl brought the wrong drinks the next time around and i had to send them back and then , she brought chris the wrong dinner we had to wait for a new one sigh so much for the fun night but at least it made for an amusing albeit chilly story i was happy to get home to my warm shower that night of course laundry had to be done right away lest any stains set in they took of the price off the bill and gave me a little voucher for a free entree for the next time we came in does n't it seem like more should have been done ? nobody apologized for the wrong drinks or entree the girl was n't even nice about that anyhoo , they announced yesterday that they are going bankrupt the branch we went to never does a good job , so i hope they close that one ! save you might also like mother 's day and the birth before and now couch potato linkwithin
