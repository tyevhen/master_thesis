tartrazine , also known as yellow , is a coal tar derivative azo dye found in a lot of processed food , including kraft macaroni and cheese , doritos , mountain dew , peeps , and many soups , custards , mustards , baked goods , cotton candy , ice cream and tons and tons more it 's also in a million and one other products we may use on a daily basis lotions , face soaps including the one i used this morning , body soaps including the one i used this morning ! , cosmetics , shampoos , hand stamps you name it ! despite this multimodal ingestion and cutaneous exposure , only a very small amount of the dye is used in each product , so total exposure might be around teaspoon in a year from wikipedia , so take that number with a grain of salt the cspi site says around mg a day on average based on usage data but probably more for kids and those who live on mountain dew there 's no reason , though , to freak out and empty out the pantry and medicine cabinet dose is important but , as we well know , some of us can bathe in toxic substances and come out smelling like a rose , and others are sensitive to very small amounts the reason i'm looking at it more closely today is because if you hunt around the internet searching for possible creepy things about industrial food dyes , tartrazine has the worst reputation and , indeed , it was one of the several dyes used in the southampton study i discussed earlier this week and the whole study cocktail of dye and preservative did lead to increased hyperactivity in kids its use as a food additive is subject to a ban in the uk and voluntary bans in other european countries , like norway in fact , the center for science in the public interest in the us called for the fda to ban yellow number on june , here 's a cute pdf from cspi food dyes , a rainbow of risk but how might tartrazine cause problems ? well , some people around , , more or less are definitely allergic to it hives , purpura , anaphylaxis , the real deal this is why the fda declared that it has to be on the labels of food if it is used for people with hypersensitivity , and you can run afoul of the fda if you include tartrazine in your product and do n't label it not unusual lots of natural and manmade chemicals cause allergic reactions in some people it would be an unfortunate allergy to have , as yellow number is in all sorts of things you would n't expect also , there seems to be a cross reactivity in some people with asthma between tartrazine and aspirin people with asthma caused by aspirin also seem to have asthma caused by tartrazine , and using desensitization techniques gradual increasing exposure to reduce aspirin sensitivity in one case study protected against the effects of tartrazine too hmmm what about other actions of tartrazine ? i could n't find much one study showed that application of small amounts of tartrazine caused contraction of intestinal muscle cells in guinea pigs , and the effect was blocked by atropine that clues us in that tartrazine seems to be able to activate the parasympathetic nervous system , either directly or indirectly , via the muscarinic receptor now that is quite interesting , as the central nervous system has lots of muscarinic receptors of all types known m m various activating agents of these receptors can cause things such as confusion , convulsions , restlessness , and psychosis in high enough doses at lower doses they can sometimes do the opposite , and cholinesterase inhibitors which increase the cns activity of acetylcholine , a muscarinic activator are used to treat dementia we 've taken several big leaps at this point , but it is theoretically possible that if tartrazine gets into the central nervous system , this muscarinic receptor activation might be a mechanism for some sort of psychiatric reaction like increasing hyperactivity the most intriguing information comes from this study from about how tartrazine influences the zinc status of hyperactive children now i'm still trying to get my hands on the full text institutional access website is being coy the last few days , and it seems this journal is only available online from on anyway but the abstract is telling hyperactive boys and aged matched controls were tested for zinc levels in their saliva , urine , hour urine , scalp hair , fingernails , and blood the hyperactive kids had decreased zinc everywhere but the saliva then control kids and hyperactive kids were given a tartrazine containing drink in the hyperactive kids , the blood levels of zinc went down and the urine levels of zinc went up , and their behavior got worse , suggesting that tartrazine caused them to pee out some much needed zinc it 's a bit hard to tell from the abstract , but the way i read it , it looks like the control kids zinc levels did n't change , and neither did their behavior so that might be the mechanism by which yellow number five influences hyperactivity in certain kids ironically enough , concerta , a formulation of ritalin , has yellow number as a colorant in the capsule ! the only other dirt i found on yellow number five is that it was implicated also in reducing the absorption or metabolism of vitamin b , leading to carpal tunnel syndrome , of all things at least according to dr murray here 's the link between b deficiency and carpal tunnel , anyway the rumor that the yellow number in mountain dew causes your testicles to shrink ? well , that 's not true my stance is for most kids there is no need to make a big scene at a birthday party by grabbing the bag of rainbow candy out of your kid 's hand but on a day to day basis , processed food should be avoided in favor of whole , real food anyway doing that will reduce exposure to the rainbow soup of chemicals in processed food not to mention the mountains of fructose , trans fats , and genetically modified ingredients real food is a win win weirded out by yellow number in shampoos and soap ? check the labels if it bothers you or use baking soda and apple cider vinegar as cheap alternatives to shampoo and conditioner
