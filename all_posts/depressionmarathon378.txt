things remain tough here in my world in fact , i am back in the hospital after my third ect treatment in the morning , i went home friday afternoon my friend , wendy , picked me up and helped me get settled back at home unfortunately , and my memory is a bit fuzzy as to all the particulars , but by friday evening , my mood had sunk back to such depths that wendy came back and spent the night my thoughts , i recall , got very dark very quickly i crashed i was hoping to run the twin cities marathon on sunday , but by saturday morning it was pretty clear that was n't likely to happen i spent saturday with wendy and her family , and we discussed returning to the hospital , but i was really hoping to stay out i made it to sunday morning , and i even got out on the road for a run i had no idea how far i would make it , but i was happy to be putting one foot in front of the other it was a beautiful , cool morning , and based on how sore i am today , i probably ran too far , miles , but it was so nice to be outside , moving , challenging my muscles , occupying my brain , and not focusing on my low mood , i just kept going unfortunately , once i returned home the dark thoughts did not abate wendy returned to my home last night and eventually we made the decision to head back to the emergency room i could complete an entire additional post on the idiot , er , psychiatry resident and his absolutely unnecessary contribution to my misery , but i'm choosing to skip that drama , hopefully in furtherance of my mental health suffice it to say , after hours of utter frustration and exasperation for both wendy and i , the appropriate decision was made to re admit me to the hospital i had my fourth ect treatment this morning , with two additional treatments scheduled for later this week , and hopes for discharge by the weekend i appreciate all of your ongoing thoughts and prayers your support is invaluable thank you i 'll keep you posted as the saga continues
