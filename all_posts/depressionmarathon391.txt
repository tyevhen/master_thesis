it 's been a crazy , busy week here and with the oppressive heat wave we 've been having , things have only seemed crazier and busier it 's been so hot and humid , it 's been difficult to motivate or even move ! i'm really looking forward to the upcoming holiday weekend i ca n't wait to sit back and relax jet and i will be off for an extended weekend at d 's lake house immediately after work on friday we have little planned , well , little except running through the woods , spending time with friends , eating great food , lounging with good coffee , boating , water skiing , kayaking , reading , and of course , napping right now that last option sounds the most appealing ! actually , the only concrete weekend plan i have is my mile run through the woods early saturday morning other than that , everything else is open and optional ! i am really looking forward to more time with d i 've missed him since our last weekend together , and that was only two weeks ago ! it will be so nice to be together in the peace , beauty and quiet of the lake i'm also looking forward to tomorrow i have the day off , and i have lots of things on my to do list , but by late afternoon it will be all about laughter and friendship i'm spending the evening with two of my good friends we try to get together every few weeks , but with work and family schedules , it usually ends up being more like once every couple of months no matter , we always find time life is always breezier after the three of us spend time together tomorrow we 're going to hang out at one friend 's house , chat and laugh , order pizza , jump on the trampoline , laugh some more , solve each others' problems , polish our nails , giggle , solve the world 's problems , and probably laugh all the way home it 's always a fun , energizing time i ca n't wait right now , however , i ca n't wait to hit my pillow i'm looking forward to my bed other than tired , jet and i are both doing well i 've even been able to reduce one of my anti depressants ! but that 's another post for another day until then , stay healthy , friends !
