the other day i received a blanket in the post however , it 's not just any normal blanket but one that claims to help with anxiety i do n't know about you , but i have seen these blankets advertised around for a while and they seem to be fairly new to the market in terms of anxiety remedies the blanket that i received weighs lb which is just over a stone and about of my body weight which they recommend these claim to reduce anxiety by making you feel safe , calm and acting as a hug i did begin to wonder how a blanket was able to do all of this and i was n't the only one , my partner was sceptical too but , i'm always willing to give things a try i was completely surprised i had the best sleep in a long time after using the blanket for just one night i must admit that it is first of all , extremely comfortable albeit being very heavy it has improved my sleep immensely and keeps you warm , especially at this time of year it 's not noisy either , if you 're a person who moves around a lot like myself i 've been using the blanket for around two to three weeks now and i still definitely notice an improvement in my sleep and the comfort of such my partner also agrees it 's often difficult to get him out of bed when he 's wrapped up in it the blanket also provides another function to make you feel calm and relaxed , which not only can i attribute to my improvement of sleep but it certainly does help when you begin to feel anxious it 's hard to describe but the weight of blanket gives you that feeling of safety which in turn makes you feel less anxious just trust me on this ! i would definitely recommend the blanket as it certainly has improved my sleep , comfort and anxiety it 's not a cure to anxiety , as of course you ca n't take the blanket everywhere with you but it does certainly give you moments where you can relax and be comfortable if anything , it is a superior blanket and for it 's price , i'm not sure you could find something similar if you 're interested , you can find out more , here and purchase the blanket via amazon , here amy xx
