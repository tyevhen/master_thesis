the deep freeze finally relented yesterday it actually hit the mid 's yesterday and almost degrees today , unheard of for minnesota in january ! going from at least a week of many , many degrees below zero to almost made it feel like july i took advantage of the warm sunny afternoon yesterday and went for a run outside with jet it was a perfect opportunity since i 've been back running , i think i 've only managed miles on a couple of occasions , with most of my runs averaging far less than that since i was sick in december , i 've felt sluggish and slow on my last run prior to yesterday , i barely managed x mile at minute per mile pace it felt really awful , and i was certain i was never going to run the way i wanted to again well , i'm happy to report the narrative changed yesterday jet and i managed a mile run continuous miles followed by a short walking break before i finished with another mile it was still slow , but i did n't feel sluggish and heavy i was n't panting like an overweight dog i felt like a runner again ! finally i know it 's going to be a long , long road for me to get back to being a marathoner , but i'm so glad i finally got to feel my body working in concert again it 's a small step toward the ultimate goal i'm not very patient when it comes to athletic endeavors , but i'm doing my best to hold onto encouragement rather than focus on what could be interpreted with discouragement instead i ran miles , without stopping ! this is a big deal ! the deep freeze is about to settle back into our little tropical paradise here , so i do n't know when i 'll get the opportunity to run outside again and i'm never as good running on a treadmill i hate the dreadmill , but maybe i 'll be surprised again when i next try it one thing is for sure , i 'll keep fighting i'm not giving up i will be a runner again
