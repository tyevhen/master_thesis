signed up for a half marathon yesterday silly , i know after all the struggles with running over the past year and i sign up for a half marathon ? i guess i hope having a running goal will result in the same success as did having a swimming goal but i am also worried might this be the last straw ? i have that icky , dreadful feeling in the pit of my stomach i have n't consistently run days per week for months , and the first week of my training plan calls for miles over days of running ! i have n't run days in a row in my life ! even at my most competitive , i 've always needed one or two days off it 's probably not a good sign that i will be altering the training plan already in the first week ! ! well , i have one week to work up to miles ! ! ha ! there are sixteen weeks until the race despite my fears , the race is a good goal although i will wait a bit to see what my exact race goal will be i know , i 'll make a goal to make a goal by the beginning of may certainly , i should know by then how my training is going hopefully , i will find peace with however it 's going that , actually , is a good goal
