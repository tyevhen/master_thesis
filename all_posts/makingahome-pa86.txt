i ca n't believe it 's true next week is the first of september our summer here was so cool and strange this year that it just does n't seem right to be ending already but as i stacked the canned salsa on my can cellar shelves this morning , i was met with the realization that fall is indeed right around the corner because i saw this and this and who can deny fall when you see these oh , goodness where did summer go ?
