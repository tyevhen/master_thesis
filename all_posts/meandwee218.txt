hi friends ! we finally finished up with noah 's nursery ! without further ado , here it is ! my goal in the room design was to have the space feel bright , cheerful , happy , warm , boyish and welcoming i decided to go with a nautical theme this time whereas the original nursery did n't have a set theme i wrestled with the idea for a while because i did n't want the space to feel unoriginal or boring so , i decided on the green and orange color palette to go with the robin 's egg blue walls that we kept from sister paige 's original room i also decided to go with a more preppy look for the space again trying to avoid obvious solutions my original idea was to do lime green and navy blue together , but the navy just seemed so dark and moody thus , the orange came into play the first item i decided on was the roman shades i chose a sort of preppy yachting stripe but in a lime green i ordered the fabric and had them made bywindows by melissa the rest of the room design evolved around those shades since they are a focal point i then chose the rust orange striped rug to contrast the shades i knew the patterns were very strong so i decided to go with solid colors for the crib , changing pad , and glider lastly , we chose the accessories that went on the walls to give it the nautical and preppy touches chris caught the dolphin fish hanging over the crib in bermuda years ago it 's been hanging in his parents' house in his original bedroom so we reclaimed it and put it here do n't worry , it 's secured very tightly and expertly ! we then found buoys , a life preserver , a ship steering wheel and a cool seagull hand screenprinted poster by wayne pate the green whale decal completes the look i tried to keep the accessories to the orange and green theme where possible to add interest between the windows , i found some white wooden letters for noah 's initials at the craft store i spray painted them with a glossy pumpkin orange color i suppose they add a preppy factor to the space ? i'm not very preppy so it 's hard to say ! i needed a nightlight of some sort and i remembered my parents had a light up globe for us kids while growing up luckily , they still had it stored away ! it was just what i needed to fill the space in the corner under the whale to add some interest at night , it adds a low peaceful glow perfect for feedings and diaper changes without being too bright ! i thought there was a lot of white going on in the space i wanted to add a more nautical dark wood color here and there evoking an old fashioned ship the steering wheel was a start so i added a dark basket hamper and found a matching magazine holder to use a trash can the lamp and dark wooden base once belonged to chris' beloved grandmother i added a new shade and lined it with some green ribbon decorative tape for interest the rocker glider decision was tough i wanted lime green but most places did n't have one that was affordable to us but i did n't want a neutral color like most chairs come in so , we went with orange in an affordable style i was disappointed to find , when the chair finally arrived , that the white piping it was supposed to have was also orange oh well i did n't want to send it back and wait another months for it to be fixed so we 're living with a solid orange chair no biggie , i suppose sigh the white piping would have added that preppy edge i wanted hmph i added a lime green pillow to break up all that orange it 's a comfy spot for feeding , reading and snuggling and that 's what i care about most after all so , that 's the grand tour ! i hope you like it ! i love being in there that middle of the night feeding is n't so bad when i have such a cheerful and cozy space to look at here 's a photo of paige 's nursery before everything moved to her new room so you can compare the different rooms sources are below wall color benjamin moore robin 's nest we painted in , so i do n't know if it 's part of their program now ?
