i was happy to be part of a recent conversation on the online tv show for the love of learning , along with pat farenga and pam sorooshian we covered many interesting topics , and i was left feeling like there was so much left we did n't get to explore while i do n't agree with everything my co guests had to say , i was still blown away by many of their insightful comments and stories , and was thrilled to be included in such good company i hope you enjoy watching this as much as i enjoyed doing it ! you might also like learning by doing education made real a short interview with an idzie making the choice and how unschooling works finding balance and learning in place unschooling is n't new really , it is n't linkwithin
