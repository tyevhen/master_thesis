time flies whether you are having fun or not in a couple of days it will have been five months since i started taking dutasteride as promised , this is my monthly update the best way i can explain the journey so far is months flying high and feeling great better than i have felt in a several years i continued to gain strength and add exercises reps it felt like a miracle energy was very good and level no fluctuations no side effects months the high is gone , but the effects are still positive i now consider myself mortal again no longer able to leap tall buildings with a single bound my strength remains good perhaps a gain of one to two years from where i was in january i had to back off slightly on the light day exercises i believe i just pushed myself too hard and went to far after backing off , everything was much better my energy is still good and fairly constant i do not seem to have the constant high , but it is stable with only an occasional small waiver for a day no apparent side effects the late may scare when i had overdone is long behind me and i am a little smarter at least i hope so and listening to my body again
