a few months ago , i did a three part series on stigma which you can find below part part part this post however , i have felt the need to write after mental health coming up in a few discussions in class and it appears that quite a few people still have the impression that everyone with a mental illness is a person who is running around on a rampage how wrong they are ! this post will hopefully clear it up for anyone who still has the idea of such a stereotype i am not an expert in every field of mental illness and i am still learning about my own every day , but i aim to get rid of some myths in today 's post in this post by time to change , it dispels some myths about mental illness and i advise you to take a look in the meantime , here are a few of my personal favourite mental myth busting facts people who are mentally ill are violent the majority are not violent people with mental health are more likely to be victimised from hearing in discussions , when people talk about mental illness they just think of violence and horror movies i suffer mainly with anxiety as a mental illness and i am not violent my auntie who suffers with depression is not one who goes around like you see in the horror movies either as can be seen in the dispute between asda and tesco with their halloween costumes , the majority of people with a mental illness are not like that we are normal people mental illness does n't define me i am not a mental illness i am me , with mental illness being something i must deal with i find it very sad when the first words that people come out with when thinking about mental illness is dangerous , violent and crazy too often the use of the word mental and comparing a person to someone in a mental institution is just reinforcing the stereotype they are many in institutions who are suffering with conditions such as eating disorders and depression it gives an increasing importance to get rid of the stigma if you 're mentally ill , you would 've been sectioned not the case there are many people with eating disorders , anxiety , depression and others that are not sectioned there is often help within the community , people who go to therapy sessions and so on many can live a next to normal life you can see if someone 's mentally ill not true if you saw me you would n't even guess it i 've had many a friend tell me 'i would never have expected it to be you' just because you ca n't see it does n't mean there 's no effect the videos below from time to change may help you to have a new outlook , if not already if this changed your mind and helped , please share we must reduce the stigma best wishes , amy xx
