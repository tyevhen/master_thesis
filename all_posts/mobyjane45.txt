i spent years as a manic depressive , they call it bipolar now , wandering in confusion around my life , until i decided i would refuse all thoughts of despair because they were a waste of time and ultimately came to nothing except to exacerbate my downer feelings why couldn t i control these thoughts of mine ? after all , weren t they my thoughts , happening in my brain ? believe me i had tried despair for years and that certainly didn t work i came to the rational conclusion that thinking negative or painful thoughts is a human being 's most unnecessary , unintelligent and pointless activity and i also came to the conclusion that i could choose to think any thought i wanted , that i had free choice of any thought i wanted to think the conclusion i came to is that it is possible to insist that you not any longer care to think these unwanted thoughts that it is possible to think another thought other than a negative one and insist , insist , insist on thinking your own chosen thought so that is what i do
