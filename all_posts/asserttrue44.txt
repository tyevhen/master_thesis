newsflash you do n't have to take a shower every day see the guy in the photo ? he has n't taken a shower in years and he wants to liberate you from the routine , too david whitlock of aobiome meet david whitlock , the brains behind aobiome 's mother dirt line of skin probiotic products at first , it sounds crazy stop showering ? for years at a time ? and not stink ? how ? and your mood will improve ? wait what ? i was reading the interview with whitlock at motherboard , where he talks about restoring the skin 's microbiome by adding back the ammonia consuming bacteria you wash off in the shower , and the one statement that jumped out at me was the greatest and most amazing change is that i m always in a good mood now turns out , there 's a scientifically plausible explanation for this possibility which i 'll get to in about two seconds , but it also accords well with anecdotal data , because as it turns out i'm married to someone who takes few showers my wife has schizoaffective disorder a form of schizophrenia , and like most people with schizophrenia , she often goes many days between baths typically , she 'll shower once a week , although over christmas holiday , she went three weeks it never occurred to me that not showering might be a form of self medication until i read the whitlock interview whitlock has n't showered in years , and the main thing he 's noticed is an improvement in mood how can that be ? can it be ? nitrosomonas has a characteristic lamellar membrane structure , with specialized membranes that oxidize ammonia and pump nitrites and nitric oxide away from the cytoplasm well , it so happens that the products sold by whitlock 's company contain ammonia oxiding bacteria aob , hence aobiome , which occur naturally in soil and seawater we 're talking here , specifically , about nitrosomonas , an important component of the nitrogen cycle and the kind of organism that could well occur on mars , if life is ever found on mars nitrosomonas is a brilliantly specialized organism , able to subsist entirely on co and ammonia think about that it burns ammonia for fuel , producing nitrites and no nitric oxide as waste products nitric oxide is an extremely interesting molecule it 's a gas at room temperature soluble in oil as well as water extremely corrosive penetrates cell membranes with ease and is probably the most widely distributed free radical in the human body in addition to its well known role as a vasodilator , nitric oxide also serves as a neurotransmitter unlike most other neurotransmitters that transmit information only from a presynaptic to a postsynaptic neuron , the small , uncharged , and fat soluble nitric oxide molecule can diffuse widely and readily into cells david whitlock 's contention is that by washing good bacteria off our skin every day , we not only promote a rapid reaccumulation of stinky ammonia on our skin , we also deprive ourselves of a small but important amount of nitric oxide , which would otherwise come from the activities of bacteria like nitrosomonas , which convert ammonia to nitric oxide i have n't yet had an opportunity to try aobiome 's mother dirt products if you 've used them , i 'd certainly like to hear your experience tweet me , but the aobiome story , it seems to me , is intriguing , and the company 's web site is imho a textbook example of how to do a product web site the right way , with plenty of drill down points for discovering more information , tons of interesting testimonials , and a minimum of hard sell what i 'd like to see from aobiome , at this point , is more science data on nitric oxide production and bioavailability , data on skin microbiome diversity , skin ph data , skin ammonia data , things of that nature the mother dirt story is compelling , as is a little more science can only take it to the next level skin care products that improve mood ? skin probiotics that help conserve water ? sounds like a growth industry to me sign me up a big thank you to all the great people who retweeted me yesterday buy my books or click to find out more , at least have you added your name to our mailing list ? thank you be well
