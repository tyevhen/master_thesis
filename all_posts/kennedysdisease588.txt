the comment below has been around for some time it shows it is from f scott fitzgerald and recently posted on the chattanooga writers guild facebook page if you have difficulty reading it , just click on the image yet , the quote is actually from eric roth who adapted the script for the movie , the curious case of benjamin buttons and the scene is the letter to caroline i am certain mr roth appreciates any reference to his writing and fitzgerald 's it does n't matter who wrote it it is beautifully written i love the comments see things that will startle you feel things you never felt before meet people who have a different point of view it 's never to late to be whatever you want to be there are no rules to this thing the challenge is fascinating because it is an encouragement to all of us , including those of us who are living with a disability kennedy 's disease or any other condition wow what a powerful message
