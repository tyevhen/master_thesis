since my education is and has always been in my own hands , i find myself increasingly interested in education and specifically unschooling recently i am now reading the book walking on water reading , writing , and revolution by derrick jensen and am soon to be reading everywhere all the time a new deschooling reader by matt hern i am quite enjoying walking on water , since jensen is an amazing author , and since everywhere all the time includes contributions from grace llewellyn and john taylor gatto i'm sure i 'll enjoy that book as well i 've been thinking a lot lately , now that i feel so fired up about life in general , how i 've kind of wasted my life so far in years what have i done ? either for myself or the world ? i have n't helped to save a forest , or feed the homeless , or bring down civilization , or learn to be completely confident in myself , or paint a picture on canvas , or write a book i have n't opened a business or got a job i think of all the things i could have done throughout my teenage years as an unschooler , and it does n't seem i 've done any of them ! then my other perhaps more rational side gets a bit of a voice before my teenage years , i lived as i believe a child should playing lots , doing school type stuff only when i was interested and found it fun except for a few times we attempted learning math from a textbook it did n't work during my early teens , i became extremely reserved would i have been able to work either in my own or anothers business where i had to deal with the public ? the answer is a resounding no and i do n't think i even knew that the trees or world needed saving ! i mean my mother talked about environmental stuff sometimes , but it did n't really register with me i had to come to the realization that the world needs help myself in the past few years i 've gotten over a lot of fears and reservations to do with people although i'm certainly not an extrovert , i'm much more comfortable in social situations , and much more comfortable with my own beliefs and opinions i know the direction i want to head in life or , more accurately , that i do n't want to head in a direction at all ! i 'll go where life takes me , confident that what i believe in is right , or at the very least that i'm following what i believe with the best intentions i know to always question and never think i know it all i know that learning never stops , that the world needs help , and that i want to do everything in my power to help perhaps my mother is right , i am just a bit of a late bloomer but now i feel as if i'm ready to emerge from my cocoon , to try new things , as scary as they may be , and to follow the path i want to in life , not the one my father wants me to perhaps if i 'd gone to school instead , i would be completely lost , unknowing of myself , and still mired in the depression i not so long ago cast off perhaps , if i 've gotten to this point , i have n't wasted any time at all perhaps this is just the beginning flying free
