jesse has wanted to do a guest blog post for a while now , and the new yorker article finally got him blogging i wrote a brief post yesterday , but he does a more thoughtful analysis of this complicated and provocative issue clink is off somewhere i am looking forward to hearing her thoughts after the holiday in god knows where i am rachel aviv sees the protagonist linda s refusal of treatment as an expression of her illness the moral impasse she describes for our profession , though , is real denial of the need for treatment , or of one s illness , can be an expression of that illness the refusal of treatment can also be a valid position which we understand and support mental functioning can be variable , at times better and at times worse at times the craziest thoughts are held in check , or do not manifest themselves , while at others they hold total sway the underlying assumptions of our society are shared by us , and these shape our reaction to the illness that linda has other societies , with different traditions and philosophical underpinnings , are comfortable with very different stances before linda was discharged from the hospital the staff did everything they could to dissuade her , and to provide for her safety she rejected every effort to provide housing and support the hospital argued that she was too sick to make decisions which even included not allowing the staff to notify her sister and daughter after her death the family sued , stating that insufficient effort had been made to protect her the hospital then argued she was not sick enough to justify stronger measures what was true ? when we look at a complex issue , or event , we naturally can only see a part , and our response is shaped both by what we see as well as the assumptions we carry what weight to we place on independence versus the rights of others ? what extrapolation can we make to an unusual thought , in that do we see it as the harbinger of insanity or of artistic creativity ? do we value religious musings or find them suspect ? aviv lets us see that while a part of linda s functioning might have been creative , artistic , perceptive and so on , it was increasingly shaped by an imagination which was not tempered by reality it was as if she was in a dream but could not awake , a dream which increasingly dominated the most important parts of her ability to survive so what is the proper role of society when confronted by such illness ? what if her fantasies had shifted from thinking spies were all around her to imagining the world could only be saved if she were to shoot her congresswoman ?
