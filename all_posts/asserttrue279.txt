antibiotic resistant bacteria have been in the news lately , with the usual scary talk about drug resistant bacteria taking over the world , with a return to the dark ages if we do n't do something certain facts about drug resistance tend to get lost in these sorts of news stories there 's a common misconception that somehow the introduction of antibiotics first in medicine , then in agriculture caused bacteria to invent new drug resistance genes out of nowhere that 's nonsense , of course the lederbergs showed in that drug resistance genes were are preexisting , and did not come into being because of antibiotics rather , bacteria already equipped with such genes were able to survive treatment with antibiotics around it also became clear that bacteria can share drug resistance genes by exchange of extrachromosomal dna plasmids bacteria that do n't have the magic genes can get them from their buddies but , so how is it that the genes for antibiotic resistance already existed prior to the introduction of antibiotics into the food chain and into medicine ? the answer is simple antibiotics are natural products produced by common soil and water microorganisms penicillin is produced by a mold streptomycin is produced by the soil bacterium streptomyces certainly hundreds maybe thousands of different kinds of antibiotics exist in the natural environment they 've been there for millions of years mycobacterium tuberculosis atcc erdman strain has two multidrug resistance genes , and they reside on the main chromosome not on a plasmid they 're shared by other members of the mycobacterium genus , including the leprosy bacterium , m leprae in the latter , one of the genes in question mlbr is a pseudogene it 's interesting to compare this pseudogene with its counterpart , erdman , in mycobacterium tuberculosis atcc the two genes are nearly the same size base pairs versus this is quite interesting in itself , inasmuch as most pseudogenes in m leprae are truncated averaging just base pairs but the comparison gets even more interesting when one does a side by side analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms changes to individual bases first i did a snp comparison of the tuberculosis drug resistance gene to its counterpart in m indicus pranii , where there were total base pair differences , distributed amongst the st , nd , and rd base pairs of codons as , , this is the expected pattern the largest number of mutations tends to accumulate in the third codon base the so called wobble base , because mutations in this base give a large percentage of synonymous codon changes owing to codon degeneracy the next highest number of mutations is expected in the first base , because there is some but not much degeneracy in that position all mutations in the second base are non synonymous and likely to affect enzyme function hence , the lowest number of mutations occurs in the second base when i ran the same check between the m tuberculosis gene and its counterpart the pseudogene in m leprae , i found that the mutational differences totaled changes and segregated by base as , , unexpectedly , the same pattern emerges the reason this is unexpected is that one expects a pseudogene to contain frameshifts that would destroy the reading frame , mooting st nd rd base comparisons more generally , one expects massive random mutations all along a pseudogene 's length of the kind that would tend to make all three of the above numbers equal , even without frameshifts so the fact that we still see the familiar pattern of st nd rd base mutations is interesting the genes in question were unequal in length , so to do these comparisons i had to disregard a base leader portion of the aligned genes i aligned the genes via clustalw using mega i also ignored the unequal length trailer portions of each gene , analyzing only the interior aligned portions from base to base also , to facilitate the analysis , i removed one adenine representing a one base insertion in the m leprae gene , at position , to restore the reading frame but it 's interesting that at that position there 's a run of six adenines , indicative of a slippery site , of the kind associated with frameshift signalling the m leprae pseudogene mlbr behaves as if it is still a normal gene , accumulating mutations in the right places an alternative explanation is that the m leprae and m tuberculosis genes were already in pretty much this orientation relative to each other before the two species diverged , and m leprae simply accumulated very few additional mutations in the pseudogene after it became a pseudogene m leprae is assumed to have experienced a massive pseudogenization event between and million years ago for more about m leprae 's strange assortment of pseudogenes , see this post and also this post
