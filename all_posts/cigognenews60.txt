a recent federal government study shows that suicide in the united states has become epidemic , hitting an alarming year high see http www nytimes com health us suicide rate surges to a year high html more and more people , both men and women in almost every age group , are killing themselves , according to a report from the national center for health statistics and experts are struggling to adequately explain the troubling trend the question of what has driven the increases is unresolved , leaving experts to muse on the reasons , states the new york times in an article about the suicide data and so they speculate maybe it s the rising divorce rate , or the lower rates of marriage maybe it s the worsening economy or the new limits on social mobility or maybe it s the country s weak suicide prevention network they can t find the answers , i believe , because external factors are not the cause they are just the trigger after all , many people get divorced and lose their jobs and their homes , or worse , but don t decide to end their lives the explanation is elusive because the causes are hidden they lie deep inside the desperate individuals who see no way out but death , and who may not even know what is driving their desire to take their own lives the best way to illuminate the problem is to look at it from the other side set aside for a moment those poor souls who are suffering obvious misfortunes consider instead those apparently lucky people who have it all , but still choose to end it all why do so many celebrities commit suicide ? suicide and success celebrity suicides always strike us as a mystery these are successful , wealthy people we admire and emulate we even try to be like them so when the rich and famous find their lives too much to bear as did l wren scott , the high end fashion designer and girlfriend of mick jagger we inevitably wonder why scott hanged herself in the multi million apartment she had shared with jagger in new york she didn t leave a note her friends , who described her as kind and considerate , were shocked jagger , who was on tour with the rolling stones in australia , issued a statement claiming he was still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way everyone was asking the same question there have been a number of people who have committed suicide who seemed at the pinnacle of success and most of us thought that once we choose a profession and follow it and succeed at it , becoming an expert and well known , that would be fulfilling we would feel like a success wrong when we have deep rooted lack of love , rejection , indifference and lack of touch early in our lives we cannot feel like a success we can only feel what was left embedded in us as an imprint the feeling of being unloved , empty , isolated , unwanted that is always primary all else and all later feelings lie on top of the imprint we need to keep in mind that the imprint is embedded very early in life when the struggle has a life or death quality it takes precedence over any later adversity the memory is of a life endangering event it is not an imaginary time survival is at stake lack of oxygen at birth and later , even the slightest threat takes on the original force of the reaction through resonance the terror is again elicited what is set off ? the feeling tone , for feelings are primary very early in life , long before we develop an overall sense of the total context but the feeling tone will be an augury of a trauma gone by , and also a pathway to the past where the tone originated , engendered by perhaps an overdose of anesthetic to the mother for her pain but is far , far too much for a six pound baby that tone hopelessness may well underlie later depression , which seems such a mystery but we are immersed in a sense of what s the use ? there is no reason to try or to go on we are trapped in that imprinted memory where it was hopeless and what do we do when we are bereft of that knowledge of the lingering tone ? we seek to submerge it further with drugs we do the opposite of what is required , which is to release that memory from its neurobiologic cage
