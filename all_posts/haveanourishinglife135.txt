as you know , the internet is busting with information it can be used as a powerful tool , if you know what you are doing however , if you are looking for eating disorder recovery information , i caution you there are many websites out there that actually promote eating disorders as opposed to eating disorder recovery it s very sad sometimes , they don t disguise their language other times , these people who promote eating disorders operate under code words like thinspiration and skinnydeep they might assume good intentions but that doesn t make it right even on pintrest , there are hundreds of thousands of motivational boards that encourage eating disorders these boards contain pictures of airbrushed models , unrealistic sculpted muscles , coveted outfits or looks , exercise routines , and obsessive food information all gathered in one place with the intention to motivate one to lose weight what results is not self love this information causes obsessive compulsive behaviors , unnatural relationships with food , and eating disorders if a person is teetering on the verge of an eating disorder , the internet can be a very dangerous place i am not exaggerating when i say that the internet is a bombardment of unrealistic expectations just a little advice if you want to love yourself more , don t go on pintrest i particularly like this one particular blog , ed bites recovering from an eating disorder one bite at atime by carrie arnold she gets pretty technical because she does a lot of research what i like most , however , are the discussions that come from her blog posts she reaches a wide audience and i love the diversity in the responses carrie recently published a post titled , why i don t lovemy body and i don t really care her point was that she s recovered from an eating disorder yet still doesn t love the way her body looks during ed recovery , across the board , there is a lot of push to have a positive body image in order to keep the negative thoughts at bay but ms arnold was saying that she just can t love her looks no matter how hard she tries and she is at a point now where she s realized that she doesn t care if she ever ends up loving the way she looks i thought she had an interesting point and reading the article caused me to question how i approach my own self love when i think about it , i am still trying to love the way i look and i am not sure if that is possible or necessary however , i wasn t fully satisfied with her article until i read this comment from an ed bites reader i think the important thing to realize is that there is a difference between loving your body s appearance and loving your body loving your body means feeling gratitude for the amazing things your body does instead of just focusing on how it looks it means experiencing the wonder that comes with the realization that you have a trillion cells in your body that all come from the same dna but are specialized to become skin cells , nerve cells even fat cells etc the power that comes with realizing that women have bodies that are capable of creating a whole new organ ! to support developing life the gratitude that comes with realizing that your bones , muscles and nerves carry you , let you walk , type and stroke your soft kitty s fur the amazement that comes when you realize that you carry the genetic signature of your parents , your grandparents , your great great grandparents and can pass this on to a new generation your body is so so much more than the clothes you fit it into , your shape , or your body composition i thought whoever wrote this had such beautiful insight loving yourself does not necessarily mean you have to love the way your body looks we live in a fallen world , thanks or no thanks to adam and eve whichever way you want look at it we are all born with original sin , which means we are going to struggle with sin until we die and , speaking of death , every person is going to have to die someday my body is not perfect your body is not perfect actually , all our bodies are slowly headed toward decay at the end of time , if we reach eternal life , we will have perfect bodies there is something deep down inside of us , ingrained in our wiring , that wants to have a perfect body we just have to remember , however , that we will not be perfect in this life , but the desire to be perfect is proof that we are meant for something greater this is a superficial way to think about eternal life but when you 're struggling with an eating disorder , it means a lot on this earth , i might not ever love the way my body looks , and that s ok instead of focusing on loving the look of my body , i will aim for thankfulness of what my body can do i am grateful that my body can write a blog post paint a picture run a few miles weed my garden give my husband a hug knit a blanket make a new and delicious meal see my family and friends canoe down a river sit around a campfire play games with my friends hold a baby drink a really good cup of coffee listen to a beautiful song watch seinfeld with my husband ride a bike go to holy mass sing in a choir read a great book take an epic nap play tennis with a friend play with kiddos at a park now it s your turn make a gratitude list of all the things that your body allows you to do
