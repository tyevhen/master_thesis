it must be nice if i did n't have depression , feeling physically ill would n't be scary if i did n't have depression , my sore throat , body aches and malaise would be simple i 'd sleep in , lie around in my pajamas , eat some chicken soup , take a couple of tylenol , and practice my best napping skills and that is what i did today , but because i have depression , it was n't that simple simple would have been nice unfortunately , depression seems to complicate everything , even physical illness i'm sick but rather than simply taking care of my illness , i spent the day worrying about my mental health i could n't stop questioning whether my fatigue and malaise were the result of my physical illness , or if they were the first signs of another depression relapse setting in i found myself analyzing every little symptom over and over again , is this a cold , or is it depression ? it was a long , uncomfortable day the bottom line is i do n't like feeling tired , achy and slow it 's too familiar and it 's too close the fact that i'm feeling tired , achy and slow during my final week of tms treatments is also an unfortunate coincidence that fact only heightens my anxiety and my analysis of course all of my analyzing and questioning was for naught today i still feel sick , and i'm still uncomfortable with feeling sick i'm still worried feeling ill , if it is n't a sign of something bigger already on the horizon , may actually trigger something more menacing it 's scary i do n't want to go back there regardless of what i want , i'm not going to change the outcome by worrying and or analyzing every symptom this illness is what it is , and it will be what it will be i do know that it 's just that simple
