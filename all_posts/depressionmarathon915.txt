i returned to running today , and boy am i paying for my time off ! i ran miles i planned to run , but my calves would n't allow it puck seemed no worse for the layoff it 's so fun for me to watch him run he appears to be smiling the whole time ! anyway , as i was saying , my calves tied up into knots and would n't let go i'm still paying the price right now hours later ! ouch i wish i could have gotten out the door earlier this week despite my physical discomfort , i already feel better mentally my mood seems lighter , and i have more energy there was certainly a sense of community out on the road this morning it seemed everyone in town was out running i like feeling part of the running community when i'm sitting at home , that 's another thing i lose community it was great being out there with the masses again i wanted to run long today because i'm contemplating another marathon in december i think i really need that goal in front of me right now besides , i ran a marathon in october for fun , and i still ran well in richmond weeks later why not do it again ? i 'll see how my legs feel tomorrow i may need to reconsider my plan if my calves do n't cooperate i 'll let you know
