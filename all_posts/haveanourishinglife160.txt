poem for the start of a new day the state you leave your bed will reflect the state of your head so , make your bed and do your hair do you hair and you ll think fair to go even farther , i would say , brush your teeth for a productive day to top it all off , eat your breakfast food breakfast will put you in a good mood painting via mary borchers art these little things that you can do , will show yourself that you love you ! anonymous photo courtesy morning sunrise on plattner pike , by mary borchers painting via mary borchers art
