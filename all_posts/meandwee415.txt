you are my sunshine , my only sunshine you make me happy when skies are gray you 'll never know dear , how much i love you please do n't take my sunshine away once , during the times we were trying so hard to have a baby i had a dream in it , i was holding such a lovely little baby it was a little girl she must have been around months old and she was sitting in my lap i was at a bbq in the summer i remember she had little ponytails in her hair short little ones i remember feeling the warm sun on my skin and the top of her head was warm from it i had nestled my chin onto her head and could breathe in the smell of her shampoo i felt so much love and affection in that moment i felt so content with the world and that everything was perfect i felt a love i 'd never felt before and then i woke up i lay in the dark feeling so sad i cried it had felt so real and then it was gone i never forgot that dream , nor did i forget the feelings i had in it i heard the song you are my sunshine again today and the second verse made me take pause and reminded me of my dream the other night dear , as i lay sleeping i dreamed i held you in my arms but when i awoke , dear , i was mistaken so i hung my head and i cried i always sing that song to paige before her naps and i never made the connection about the second verse until today listen to the song version we like here i'm so happy little p is with us i think of that dream when i watch her sleep and my heart swells even greater than the moment before and , just because , here is paige in my favorite hippo jammies soon they wo n't fit and i just had to document her wearing them save
