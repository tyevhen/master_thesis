phew ! just as expected , i'm really tired i just woke up from a well deserved nap following a long week at work as i delineated in my last post , working a full time schedule , five consecutive days , is tough for me unfortunately , things were made tougher this week because we were very busy we had many more patients than usual , and some of them were quite difficult i'm exhausted despite the extra hours and days , i tried to keep up with my other routines this week , but regular exercise , good sleep , and decent nutrition were a struggle i guess i did okay , not stellar , but okay i would have liked a bit more sleep , and my household chores suffered , but i did get in some exercise i attempted to run again on tuesday it was frustrating and disappointing i again tried to run for three minutes and take one minute walk breaks my left leg just would n't cooperate my gait was sloppy and slow i did n't have enough muscular strength to fully stabilize my hip , knee or ankle when weight bearing on my left leg my left foot eventually went numb i wished so sincerely for a different outcome , but it was n't to be i arrived home forlorn i'm trying to fight it , but my desperation with not being able to run is growing with each passing non running week , i feel it more and more right now i ca n't see a light at the end of the tunnel there is still so far to go , and i ca n't tell anymore if i'm making even a bit of progress my poor run on tuesday stole a lot of hope the possibility of never being able to run again is more and more real i do n't like that i think it will be quite awhile before i attempt to run outside again i 'll stick to the alter g treadmill for now i'm looking forward to getting back into a more normal routine , a full weekend off , and more free time next week i 'll still look to work extra hours and earn some extra money , but i think i 'll avoid working five consecutive days for awhile and now , i think i 'll curl up with a warm blanket and watch tv until slumber settles in carry on , my friends
