kathleen took this picture of me after we first moved in to our new place where my current depression began on april notice there is no comfort in the pillow , only grotesquerie two slim futons like the one pictured were our only furniture yesterday i had an appointment with my new psychiatrist i had asked for one because i was slipping he 's not big on psychopharmacology , it appears , as i tell him what i need and he writes a prescription , or better , gives me samples , without comment then he tries to engage me in a therapeutic conversation his hands are very expressive when he talks , almost hypnotic and his glasses magnify his eyes in an owlish way if i were n't depressed i would have ended the session after the medications were taken care of instead i let him go on to fill the hour , during which he explained to me how performance could never achieve love , a concept i have trouble getting , but concern for an inner construct does not matter to me at the moment i'm underwater i tell him kathleen makes me a list of things for me to do each day , and that this helps keep me sane he says that my performing said tasks is another way of earning an acceptance that ca n't be earned i say , no , doctor , these manual tasks help distract me from myself i'm way below the level of trying to earn anything with them and so it went he wanted to talk psychology , i was only interested in biology the worst of it was at the end of the session , when he gave me a big bag of samples and said , merry christmas whereupon i shook his hand , but he said , up here we do more than that we hug and he wrapped his year old freckled arms around me at roughly the level of my navel , and i tried to hug back , feeling awkward i wanted to tell him that he had violated my boundaries by coercing me into a false intimacy , but i did n't want to imperil the samples and prescriptions i have no insurance sometimes it 's hard putting up with psychiatrists just to get the medications you need it takes a while to train a new one thine in oppression by professionals , ce still at three kilorats
