last week i was lucky enough to be treated to a trip to rome with my lovely boyfriend ! i had the best time and definitely was n't ready to come home ! rome is the most spectacular city i have ever visited it was incredible to look one way and see modern architecture and department stores and then flip your head around and see buildings that are over years old right in the same street ! ! as well as soaking up all the culture the city had to offer , my favourite thing about the trip was the food ! i'm not ashamed to admit that not a day went past that i did n't eat pasta ! thats right , pasta nights in a row , and i do n't regret a thing ! typically we 'd go out to eat around pm and then wander around until we found the nearest gelato shop which was n't hard seeing as there was one on every corner ! then stroll back to our hotel , stopping off at different piazza 's on the way to take in the sights bliss ! everything about the trip was amazing i feel so lucky to have been able to visit one of the most beautiful cities in the world i 've only just got home and i'm already desperate to go back related posts things i 've learned in years suzyblue a trip to rome suzyblue ootd monochrome at sunset suzyblue my evening skincare routine suzyblue a year in pictures suzyblue homeware wishlist suzyblue
