after my volunteer shift at the animal shelter yesterday i started feeling anxious my gig involves socializing with cats , which i love and yesterday , also gauging my comfort level with the idea of getting a new cat yes , my kitty has only been gone for five days it 's too soon for me , and my poor husband was out of town when cc was euthanized , so he still needs to process the fact that she 's really gone nonetheless , i want to start thinking having cats in our family once again the house is just so fucking empty right now what i ca n't tell is whether i'm anxious because i started imagining myself with other cats , or because of the empty house every time i hear a noise , i think oh , that 's cc only it 's not cc , and it never will be that 's one of the things about grief though always thinking you see the deceased out of the corner of your eye , or hearing them in the other room , or thinking that they 're on the couch or upstairs or wherever this experience made me realize that i 've never been alone in my own house before i 've always had cats , ever since i moved into my own place at the age of for that matter , i got piglet and cc at that time they 've never not been here one or the other was always on my lap , or sitting on the couch with me , or hanging out in the next chair one or the other was usually talking to me it 's never been this quiet before , and i'm really having a hard time with it of course , i could take the xanax my pdoc prescribed me , but i'm already on so many goddam drugs , and for some reason xanax scares me so until we 're ready for another cat , i may just have to live with anxiety
