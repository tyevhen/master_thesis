i do n't know what it is , but i spend a lot of my time feeling quite numb i presume it 's my medication , which i hope to be coming off soon to see it makes a difference and also to see whether i'm well enough to live without it for a long while , i have felt less than i feel i should sometimes i struggle to feel happiness , in the same way i struggle to feel love and sometimes sadness too it 's really weird for me , because although i have never worn my heart on my sleeve , a lot of the time and in the past i have felt more numbness than i have happiness and although this can been seen to be part of depression , the pure distance and spacing out seems to be a side effect or either my disorder or medication this is because sometimes with anti depressant medication , it can blanket how you 're feeling to try and compensate for the depression it 's also possible , which may be in my case , for the medication to change and not work in your favour like it used to , and that 's okay my medication was my lifeline , but perhaps now after three years , it 's time for a change i would still always suggest medication to those struggling , because it saved my life i suppose it can be quite scary to not feel like other people , and the way perhaps you should feel but , with time and will i'm hoping that i will reach myself again i know that people around me have noticed that i 've become more distant and away with myself and it 's not a nice thing for others to experience , let alone myself i know i do n't want to feel like this anymore and i know that it 's going to take time to get back to normal you 've just got to hold on in there do you have similar stories ? best wishes , amy xx
