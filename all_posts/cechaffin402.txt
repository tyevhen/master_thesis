i just want to say to all those who drink from this questionable well that i'm on hiatus until the new year unless i get the blogging bug before then i hhad a wonderful christmas at my sister 's , with all sibs there and various relatives i felt so good in their company i hope i do n't crash afterwards i realize also that one thing that has been eating at me is my environment our rental is small and the redwoods render it claustrophobic when we looked at other rentals i wanted something with an ocean view , but we did n't qualify with our credit i have an unofficial lease until next august , but i really must get out of there and get a place with a view , always a necessity in my life and how about that troop surge in iraq ? we are so blessed with our leaders and their creative logic hey , hey , george w bush how many kids have you turned to mush ? merry merry god bless you every one and toto too ! craig erick
