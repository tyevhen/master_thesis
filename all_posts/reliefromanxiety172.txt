how many times have you heard someone say to you to just be happy or to cheer up and yet it feels like an impossibility ? i know we all have down days when we feel sad and tired and times when little words of encouragement and doing what we love can make us feel a whole lot better unfortunately , this is n't always the case there have been so many occasions where people have said to me , to just think positively , when you do that your whole mindset will turn around as much as i tried , i just could n't think positively i just could n't change my life around thus , when someone says to you to just be happy , some people just feel they ca n't it 's not through a lack of trying that people feel this way after all , who would want to be in darkness for their whole life ? depression is something that many people describe as a black hole which ca n't be climbed out of , a weight on a sunny day , when everything is going well in life , but yet you cannot get out of bed in the morning depression takes away the ability to do what you love it is a real illness , which many scientists believe is based upon a chemical imbalance depression can physically stop you from doing things you can begin to eat more or less , becoming more tired and angry , or struggle to sleep you can lose interests in the things you once loved you can lose concentration and have suicidal thoughts from the inside the person may feel utterly hopeless and does n't want to talk to anyone or do anything they will be in turmoil a complete lack of lust for life this is n't ignorance , this is just the sheer lack of capability to face anything without feeling like you 're going to explode for many on the outside and who have never experienced depression , i can understand how it is difficult to accept why people just ca n't do things but , even if you do n't understand it 's important to be patient and to be there for the person the worst thing you can do is be confrontational towards them as this just makes it worse and pushes the person further into the darkness than need be often when you 're depressed you feel isolated and alone , and you need to just be there to look after them until they feel ready to face the world again depression is a serious illness and needs to be regarded with importance please do n't brush it aside do n't forget to get professional help if you or someone you know is really struggling you 've got this best wishes , amy xx
