so clink and i went to see roy today he has a big big screen and if you want to do work as a group , it 's really helpful we wanted to review our table of contents for our book proposal , to make sure we covered what we want to cover , to make sure we were n't being repetitive this is an interesting process just writing a proposal with three people roy suggested we might need three keyboards and three mice to control the single huge screen i suggested that if we did that , we 'd also need a gun things get a little loud i'm the least detail oriented of the three of us , and i tend to type fast but not quite as fast as i think , so often my stuff is missing a word here or there what 's the biggy ? roy likes the to be perfectly consistent and he worries over every word clink , well , she 's more of a big picture type of nun , so she sits there in her habit and only gets bloody once in a while so roy is in a hurry , busy man with obligations to be met suddenly , he 's handing me a key and telling me we can stay as long as we like , but do lock up he 's off clink and i remain , clicking away at our document , and at the end , i'm left with roy 's open documents on the screen , layered and overlapping , and never fully closeable , simply trying to log out of my own e mail account because i do n't want a whole gang of people later having a party over the ridiculousness of what goes on in my life we 're finally done and clink and i gather up our junk bye to doggy out we go oh , but we ca n't get out there are two locks on the door and we 're twisting and turning for a while finally clink says , when did he say he 's coming back ? uh , he did n't we try the top lock and then the bottom lock and some random pulls here i got stuffs to do clink says this is definitely a blog post this makes it better clink always makes it better i laugh at the thought , and we 're both about to turn back to the mega screen to start blogging away about being trapped and royless at roy 's , when the last turn of the lock and pull on the door finally frees us
