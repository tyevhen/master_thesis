i never thought i 'd say this , but i'm not sure what to blog about ! i seem to go in stages for weeks i 'll blog only about day to day stuff , only lightly touching on political beliefs causes and then all i 'll write about is politics for weeks on end ! so i'm asking my few readers i know i do n't have many , but you guys keep me writing regularly , so thank you very much , what do you think i should blog about ? keep blogging about political stuff ? more photography ? should i talk more about my day to day life as an unschooler ? something entirely different ? if no one has any ideas or particular preferences , that 's cool too i 'll probably think about something i want to write about in a day or two but if you do have some ideas , that 's awesome ! thank a bunch peace , idzie you might also like making transitions and following passions swirling ideas and a new poll life happening happy st birthday to this blog ! linkwithin
