i 've been asked by lots of folks whether or not i 'll be going back to work or if i'm already back to work it 's interesting timing for these questions because i have no freakin' idea what 's going on with that at least officially i know that the issue work vs stay at home can be a touchy and sensitive one for any new mom as a graphic designer , i already ran my own business from home i figured i could resume as usual once paige fell into a regular nap and daily routine well , that all sounds great on paper , but in real life ! it is not quite so simple each day is different and naps can be great or scant at best my energy levels rise and plummet like the daily tides who knows when i 'll be in the mood or find the energy to design custom wedding concepts for the most discerning of brides who wants a scripty font no wait a sort of scripty font that is still legible no wait maybe something more like calligraphy ? or no maybe i could see several versions and decide ? i just do n't have the time to properly serve clients like i used to and frankly , i want to focus on raising paige it was a long and rocky journey to get her here and i want to selfishly soak up every second in her blue eyes for as long as possible so , for now , i 've decided to be a stay at home mom i do n't know when i 'll dip my toe back into my career as a custom designer perhaps soon ? perhaps in years ? i just do n't know i'm taking each day as it comes and i'm happy with where i am at it 's not to say it has n't been an adjustment the focus is off my own interests and goals and more onto guiding the hands of a little one and that 's the change it 's just plain different and a hell of a lot more selfless than i'm used to being i 've had many discussions with others about the working vs stay at home mom debate and here 's my two cents there should n't be a face off i believe in mothering and in choice i believe in the ideal of what works for you and makes you happy is what is best if you like to work in a separate career and want to work , then i applaud you for doing so if this works for you and your family then that is all you can ask i do n't think anyone should be ashamed to say i love my job , i like to work and i'm going to continue to do so the same goes for a stay at home mother if that is what you want and enjoy and are lucky enough to be able to do , then i'm glad for you in my mind , if mom is happy , then things have a way of falling into place as they should be many women are able to do both by having a part time career and stay at home mother the rest of the time i also , though , believe in balance i believe that children need to be well cared for no matter who is caring for them i believe all mothers need special time for themselves , special time with their children , and special time as a family i think about all the wonderful mothers out there who want to stay home with their children and desire to but cannot due to financial restrictions these are cases where choice holds no place over necessity it is a difficult place to be when you are caught between completely different worlds where there is constant pull in one direction and then the other when you just want to be in one place here , the challenge is to find the good in situation at hand and to make it great at the end of the day , we all work to find a balance for what works best for ourselves and for our families no families are alike and no one solution is the cookie cutter answer for all i believe in doing what is best for you in your situation and making it great what could be more right than that ? in my case , i'm choosing to stay home with careful budgeting , i'm fortunate enough to be able to do so for this , i am sure to give my thanks and appreciation every day i enjoy the challenges of motherhood so far i'm sure i 'll have my frustrated moments as far as my career goes , for now i think i will design a cohesive line of letterpressed cards that i will sell in my online shop i can print at my discretion during my free moments this way , i can keep a toe in doing what i love without the pressure of needing to please a particular client i can always get back into it later on when we are ready , right ? but for now , the precious moments with little p are fast and furious and i just do n't want to miss any this decision works well for me , and for wee my family i hope that whatever decision you have made is working for you and yours and if it 's not , i hope you can find some sort of way to make the best of your scenario to make it great , or change it if at all possible let 's not judge each other 's choices let 's encourage each other to strive for what we most want out of life , whatever that may be , and support it as i 've said , i do n't believe what works for me should work for everyone in my upcoming posts , i 'll expand more on what i'm trying to do to make the best of my decision and how i'm trying to keep a balance hugs to you ! save you might also like playroom a beginning nursery planning in progress linkwithin
