i was disgnosed with bpd in march emotionally unstable , and anorexia when i was in hospital for a month stay with anorexia a lot of the stuff they said i didnt really believe , i didnt really look at symptoms until the last week or so properly i can see a lot of myself in the things described , yet i feel the stigma of the individual being claimed as very manipulative , angry outburst at other people or refusing to believe you are wrong etc , very hard because that isnt me at all im the first one to take on responsibilty of being wrong i never set out to hurt somebody i dont yell im very empty and not coping well right now , my self harm is here again i have such rapid moods , of feeling so happy and confident in the morning for example , then two hours later i am crying and cant make sense of anything ive gone from feeling like i can take on the world to achieve what i want and strong etc , to questioning what the heck is life , and unberable insecure my confidence and esteem is on a major low i get upset if im not included with friends , and i get upset when i am included , and then angry and upset t myself because i cant make sense of these feelings and why i react to things in such a dramatic and sad way i want to change my cpn i hadnt seen her for weeks and the last time i saw her she just nodded and looked straight ahead , i knew i shouldnt have hoped for anything i guess i just hoped for more than a nod again i dont even know what i hope for anymore , i know there are no cures but reading through things makes me feel like im a lost cause because i have been with the mental health teams since i was i was with camhs before because of my anorexia and hospital admissions , ive had sets of cbt , sets of dbt and sets of c a t , which i end next week that is all in the last years so surely there is nothing out there left for me ive been on lots of different meds as i experience hallucinations at times and i had a brief episode of being cyclothymic in yet i have no idea whether that is still a current diagnosis , not that it really matters im currently on prescribed anti deps , anti psychotics and sleeping meds ive been on the same ones for atleast years now i dont want to see my cpn anymore , i dont even have the energy to encounter her again , its not because of our last communication , just because i think we ve had our time , and i dont feel like im getting understood or getting anywhere , again i dont even know what those two things mean for me she also said the consultant pyschiatrist has to come to my review with the eating disorders team on two seperate occasions i told her i really dont want him to be there i cried the last time i saw him , he is not friendly in the slightest , i mean i know thats not his job , but there is no compassion that comes across that would also mean there would be people in one room at the review and me , that is horrible yet my cpn still is reluctant and not respecting my wishes im scared to change my cpn in this way , i dont want to have a reputation amongst other cpn s its not that i dont like my cpn , i do , i just have no energy left in me with anything i have no motivation most days to walk , and no fullfillment out of my days sometimes i can conquer lots of things but so much of relies on others around me , or making sense of the world , and being so scared and alone inside i feel like i have so many needs , and yet i cant take any step to find them if anyone has been through similar stuff to this , it would be great to hear from you , or any advice on ths or my cpn and psychiatrist issue thanks answer hi i have bpd borderline personality disorder mine got really serious many many hospital admissions , therapy but it didn t help at the time as i was too un stable so it had to stop , i was then referred by my psych to a inpatient therapeutic community for people with emerging or severe bpd and other issues that kind of go hand in hand with it so anorexia i was there for months it has made huge changes to my life and i cant thank them enough im in there year outreach programme now , its called the cassel its in ham , richmond , surrey , london and comes under west london mental health trust , look it up on the internet they take referrals from the whole of the uk , ireland and the isle of man ! so speak to your psych about this as ! good luck ps its nhs sources me
