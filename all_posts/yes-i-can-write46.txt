tv watching and book reading often seem to be seen as somewhat opposite activities books are seen as worthwhile , good for your brain , a useful way to spend time , and tv a waste of time , useless , a brain rotting and lazy pursuit in my own life , that 's never been the way i considered those two activities i might have made distinctions between fiction and non fiction , documentaries and dramas , but tv and books have never been an either or , a one versus the other they 've both been activities that have brought me great joy , and yes , led to a lot of learning books before i was reading myself , my parents were reading aloud daily stories , in some form or another , have always been a part of my life but when i started reading myself , i dove into the world of novels in a very big way there were years where i read three or even four short novels a day , and i can still easily race through the newest book in a favourite series in the course of a single day novels draw me in , too , and lead to an incredible amount of investment in imaginary people and worlds i also like sharing what i read , and it became common practice in my family years ago to tell each other about the stories we were reading sharing a book you 're enthusiastic about is really nice it 's not as social an activity as tv watching , though , which i find interesting , considering reading is often considered the more meaningful activity reading is often a deeply personal and immersive activity , which has it 's own benefits , so this is n't to say that tv is somehow better , just that i'm far from convinced that either is better , and instead feel that both provide a whole lot of positives television are you ready to watch yet ? i ask for the th time i'm not the most patient person around , and a show that 's caught my attention is a very big draw despite that impatience , and my desire to watch the next episode as soon as i'm able to , i almost always watch shows with other people the four of us who make up my family watch a variety of british mysteries , genre shows , police procedurals , and assorted dramas currently veronica mars is big with us , and we 've just started season three with great excitement to many people , tv watching looks like something solitary , something done in isolation , a passive activity involving no social interaction my experience could not be further from that not only do i almost always watch tv with family , bursting into laughter together , nudging each other with an elbow at good bits , or occasionally grabbing each other in fear well , okay , mostly i'm the only one who does that , we also talk about them throughout our watching of veronica mars , there have been countless conversations in the car , while washing dishes , and sometimes in the middle of an episode paused , of course about what was happening in the plot who killed lily ? who was where , when , and who could have been somehow involved ? every character 's actions and motivations were dissected and examined through enthusiastic discussion it 's fun to treat shows especially mysteries that way , and it becomes a real bonding experience with the people you 're watching with by being such a social and involved experience , it 's also anything but passive watching shows becomes something engaging and social , something that leads to a lot of thinking , discussing , and sharing looking critically at media and pop culture i think one of the most important things i 've learned is how to critically look at all different types of media , i said in a workshop the other day the ability to analyze and think critically about what i'm consuming whether it 's novels or non fiction books , tv shows or movies , the news or a newspaper , comic books or magazines is an invaluable skill , and one that has brought much richness , lots of deep thought and thoughtful conversations to my life i learned young from my parents that just because someone says something on tv , even on the news , does n't mean it 's true , and my sister and i learned ourselves as teens to broaden and deepen our analysis of various forms of media and entertainment i 've had discussions about the subtle sexism in buffy the vampire slayer as well as its major failings when it comes to issues of representation and racism i 've talked about the neo liberal pro military bias on a more liberal leaning news network i 've had good conversations about how the spiritwalker trilogy by kate elliott does a remarkably excellent job in portraying a range of women characters , as well as creating a fantasy world that 's both racially and culturally diverse and interesting i recently heard it suggested that tv is dangerous simply because it 's often considered fluff , junk , unworthy of serious thought , and thus people absorb a lot of messages and prejudices from what they watch , because they 're not engaging critically with what they 're viewing that seems more than possible to me , and serves as a good argument for treating tv as important , because it is a part of most peoples lives , and it affects how we think and what we learn the same can all be said about books , as they often contain messages we might feel are harmful as well once again i feel like books and tv have a lot more in common than many people realize potential negatives a lot of parents have a lot of worries about screens having a negative impact , health wise , on their children however , books are n't without negative consequences , either in my three books a day phase , and still sometimes when i get too wrapped up in a story , i read to the point of eye strain and tension headaches before i got my up to date prescription glasses , i 'd read to the point of increased blurry vision my optometrist had to make a point of telling me i had to stop reading every ten minutes or so and look out the window , focus on something far away , for the health of my eyes i know when it comes to my own physical comfort , i generally find computer screens the worst , reading on page next , and watching tv the most comfortable focusing on something a bit further away is easier the point i'm really trying to get at here is just that everything is healthier in moderation , but tv is n't necessarily worse , or less healthy , or anything else when compared to similarly stationary pursuits i feel like many people might say well that 's all fine , but you 're obviously special my children would just watch tv all day ! now , while different people have different needs , an easier or less easy time listening to their bodies , and maybe need more or less parental help in figuring things out , i do think parents often sell their kids short in thinking that all they 'll ever do is watch tv that attitude shows a strong and perhaps somewhat misplaced bias against this one form of entertainment and learning , and it also seems not to take into account that no one will want to do only one thing , forever boredom starts to set it it 's also important for children , with parental involvement and support , to figure out for themselves what feels good and bad for them , and that 's best done by exploring and trying different things and figuring out that sitting on the couch for hours does n't tend to make you feel so good i just caution parents to examine their biases , and consider that if you would n't say you 've already read too much this week , do something else , then maybe pause for a moment before saying the same about television developing a healthy relationship to screens and pages i think a rich and healthy relationship with different types of media is best gained by experiencing it with involved adults , adults who want to hear about the story their child is reading , who talk about and sometimes criticize what they see on tv and what they read in print basically , adults who engage in the shows and movies they watch and the books and magazines they read , discussing and thinking about them , will help children learn to be engaged and critical themselves some children will only really be into one or the other some will consume media in less common ways , such as listening to audio books instead of reading , whether due to learning or other disabilities or simply personal preferences if we 're going to respect that each individual is different , and will learn about and experience the world in different ways , i think part of that is realizing that placing various activities on a hierarchy of which is best to worst , or most to least educational , is counterproductive to the learning process this is n't to say i'm entirely against parents ever intervening in their children 's use of of various media i'm not i just think that creating arbitrary distinctions between things like tv and books makes little sense , and is n't an ideal environment for creating excitement about learning in all its forms , including both screens and pages in my own life i love that i can take such intense joy from a new tv show find , or a favourite novel , and that i do n't find myself feeling guilty about spending time with either of those things i love that i can be so critical of what i consume , that i'm able to deconstruct things and have thoughtful conversations about them , as well as just enjoying something without feeling a need to be strongly critical of it armed with the knowledge needed to navigate the media and pop culture around me , without any guilt about what 's useless bogging me down , i 've had a wonderful time exploring the worlds of fiction and non fiction alike it 's been and continues to be a bonding experience with others , a collection of ways i 've learned a lot of cool things and stretched my thinking in new ways , and brought countless ours of fun and enjoyment into my life my conclusion ? books and tv are both pretty great
