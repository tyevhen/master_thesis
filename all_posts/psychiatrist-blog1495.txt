i checked my email this morning only to find a forwarded blog post that suggested i do n't like chocolate lies ! scurrilous lies ! i had to post to the blog immediately to stamp out this vicious rumor i was at the chocolate affair i was there minutes before dinah dinah thinks i hardly ate any chocolate because she was late and does n't know what i was doing while i was waiting for her she should be glad i left some for her it was amazing there was chocolate cocoa with peppermint marshmellows , flavored chocolate liquers , little tiny pancakes with elaborate chocolate toppings , chocolate truffles , chocolate cake , chocolate ice cream , chocolate flavored risotto use your imagination and the reality was better i never knew it was possible to have a chocolate hangover trust me , it is it 's a combination of a lingering caffeine buzz with incipient chocolate cravings this is why they only do this event once a year of course , there 's a certain amount of irony here it was an elaborate affair and the creme de la creme of baltimore society was there including our fair mayor who was getting her chocolate on as well as the chief state 's attorney for baltimore there were fancy dresses and suits and spike heels and jewelry , all for the benefit of my patients i kept thinking about my patients who wear baggy jeans and t shirts with doc stamped on them when they 're released homeless the mental culture clash was a bit jarring so that 's the truth of the matter i love chocolate do n't let anyone tell you otherwise and dinah looked fantastic in her tiara
