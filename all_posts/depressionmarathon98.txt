perhaps some of you noticed my profile underwent its yearly edit instead of , it now says years i recently passed the year mark on my journey with depression after having depression as a teenager , i was mental illness free until i was in my early 's it was november , , to be exact , when i first noticed the familiar , unwanted symptoms creeping back into my life depression descended upon me sixteen years if you 'd asked me early in this journey , perhaps anytime in the first or years , i 'd have told you this was the worst thing that ever happened to me in the early years , my depression was severe and uncontrolled i lost everything , including my spouse , my job , my house , and even my friends i was drinking too much and bopping in and out of the hospital on a regular basis i was unstable and miserable life was n't fair , or so i thought , and i wanted to die something changed in the midst of this journey it did n't happen overnight , but something changed i changed i stopped drinking more importantly , i got sober there is a difference i began to collaborate with my doctors and providers , rather than expecting them to fix it perhaps that 's how we found some medications which worked or perhaps removing alcohol from my system just allowed them to work i regained a sense of control i stopped being a victim and began taking responsibility for my mental health the last several years have been more good than bad the hospital has n't disappeared from my journey , but it 's now a rarity rather than a regularity of course i wish i did n't have this illness i do n't wish depression on anyone but i now feel like i live with depression rather than suffer from it i ca n't totally control it , but i can certainly make choices which limit its impact on my life if i do what i can do , continue to take the next right action , and seek help when i need help living life , rather than dealing with depression , is where i get to focus my energy i no longer feel like depression is the worst thing that ever happened to me as a result of living with depression , i 've learned a lot , taken advantage of many opportunities , and grown a ton over the past years this illness has forced humility and gratitude and kindness upon me i am truly a kinder , more gentle human being because of my experience living with depression but i'm also a tougher , more resilient human being , too skills learned through the difficulty of depression actually simplify and enrich my life today i never would have guessed that years ago
