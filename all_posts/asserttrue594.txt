there 's a terrific interview with paul brainerd about the history of aldus corporation over at computerhistory org in it , brainerd comments on the why and how of aldus 's eventual acquisition by adobe a subject of considerable interest to me , since the company i work for day software has just been acquired by adobe of the acquisition , brainerd says at a , foot level , we had similar approaches to running a company but at a working level , there were some very definite philosophical differences there was a definite difference in the customer orientation we spent a lot more time talking to customers adobe 's philosophy was more of an engineering based one if we make a great product , like postscript , sooner or later people will want it but the reason i even considered adobe was their underlying ethical standard of running a high quality company that was fair to their customers and their employees unfortunately , that could n't be said of all the companies in the industry a lot of thought went into the merger , and i think it was one of the best hopefully , we 'll all be saying much the same thing about the day adobe deal years from now
