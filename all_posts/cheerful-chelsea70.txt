sat out in the sun for too long ! kidding , but it should be clear why i did this once you start reading the post ! the human body is a very clever thing i'm aware that is n't a groundbreaking statement , but it 's something i 've been thinking about recently so bare with me our bodies are capable of telling us when something is wrong if it 's a sunny day and our skin starts to burn we know its time to head into the shade , if we 've been feasting on junk food and start to feel sluggish and bloated we know its time to eat a bit healthier , and if our urine sorry ! is looking a bit too yellow its time to get a big glass of water but what about when our bodies are sending us new kinds of messages , ones that are n't of the norm that we know of of course if more people talked about strange occurrences of the body then they 'd become the norm i 've had acute tinnitus for months now a constant ringing in the ears it sounds mad , but at first i thought it was one of those high pitch noises that only young people pick up on but then i realised that i hear that noise all day long , it prevents me from falling asleep and recently i realised that i can hear it over music playing or the sounds from a tv the best way i can describe it is that its akin to the sound of a washing machine on a super fast spin cycle , when its going so fast it sounds as if it 's about to take off hearing that in the house can be pretty irritating , so if we can , we simply shut the door on it and get on with our day however , i ca n't do that it 's my constant companion , although definitely not a friend of mine i feel like an absolute nut when i talk about it , especially when i mistook it as something everyone could hear for months of course i 've mentioned it to my gp , they thought perhaps it was a side effect of a drug i was taking the devil drug and that i should simply wait and see if the ringing stopped when i was completely weened off said drug i'm now free of the devil drug , not quite free of its nasty withdrawal side effects , and yet the alarm bells are still going off in my ears i may well be a hypercondriac , after all i seem to have the worst track history when it comes to illnesses , and google m d haha hardly has enabled me to scare myself silly with the results it comes up with when i 've typed in my symptoms sometimes we all get that feeling that something really is n't right with our bodies , call it instinct , a gut feeling that this is n't just an annoying noise i have to live with i 'd really like this spin cycle to end now has anyone else experienced this ? if so , how did do you cope with it ? i really hope there are some people out there reading these blog posts and relating to them in some way otherwise i'm just having a good old natter to myself online ! feel free to comment below or send a message directly to me at cheerfulchelsea outlook com if you 're prefer to keep your message private when i first started reading blogs i was reluctant to comment due to fear of what others would think if they read what i had said , so i fully understand if others are n't ready to reach out i 'd love it if at some point we could build a nice online community and talk freely about these topics without fear of what others might say
