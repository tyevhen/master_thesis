just finished my first week of being back in training i'm tired and my muscles are sore , but i feel better having a direction i knew i would this past week i ran three times , including miles yesterday , and swam , biked , and strength trained once each it feels really good to work my muscles again i 've also done some work on my house this week today , after biking , i painted the primer on all the walls in my basement over hours of work my shoulders are sore i 'll hopefully complete the priming process by tuesday then i can paint i have n't picked out the color yet , but i 've got it narrowed down to a few different shades since it 's a basement , it 's going to be a boring shade of bright white or beige i 'll be glad when the painting is done work also went well this week i learned a new skill i admitted a couple of new patients , and my schedule was almost full tomorrow will be a very busy , full day busy and full are good things we 're a new company in town , so we are still in the process of getting our name out there and our reputation established it appears we are successfully doing so , and that 's pretty exciting i'm relaxing now in front of a boring football game my dog is asleep at my feet , awaiting his exercise i think it was a beautiful day here in minnesota , and it 's turning into a beautiful evening so i think i 'll shut off the tv , put away the computer , grab the leash , and be on my way it was a good week i'm grateful for that take care !
