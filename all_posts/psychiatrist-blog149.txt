over on the neurotransmitting blog , dr joseph andrews , a th year psychiatry resident , writes about where psychiatry sits with medical students and what we can do about it he writes , in a good deal of detail , about the finances of it all and about why someone who has taken on a lot of debt to go to medical school might not be able to afford to become a psychiatrist this is n't new i went to medical school knowing i wanted to be a psychiatrist , and there were medical schools i simply did n't apply to because i knew i would need to take on so much debt that my monthly payments would be more than i could afford on a resident 's salary ah , those schools were kind enough to provide that information in blunt terms , i remember pamphlets that said that if you needed to take out a heal loan at the high interest of the day , then you could expect to pay back month that assumed no college debt which i already had and at the time , residents made roughy , year those applications went into the trash dr andrews also talks about the stigma of psychiatry his friend 's family would be shamed if she went into psychiatry , and he talks about how there are other mental health professions for those interested in the field it 's a good post and i'm here anyway , though in college i did plan to be a psychologist i'm not sure what happened along the way , but suddenly psychiatry sounded better so i'm here to say it 's still pretty good i still like being a shrink , and people get better much more than they ever told me in medical school i still talk to my patients and get to know them at the end of most days , i feel appreciated there is still a lot of variety to what psychiatrists can do research , teaching , brief contact practices many many patients for brief med checks , or high contact practices psychoanalysis , or less high contact with psychotherapy , administration , and blogging warning no pay i do n't ever wake up and wish i was a dermatologist so do check out neurotransmitting it 's one of very few blogs by a psychiatry resident and dr andrews is just getting started
