as i was checking my email today , i received a comment notification that someone left on the blog i was shocked as i read it , and although its not flattering i decided to publish it anyway i decided to post about it as opposed to replying in the comment section here is what the person said , my take on this site , incessant monologues and content me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me hardly interesting and certainly not helpful yes , management of any condition is crucial and continual but until you address the underlying events and sources forget it your daily doodlings and cake talk are a disservice as the fake smiles and cute fonts mask any acknowledgment of underlying issues it 's denial in my opinion yes , affirmations are great coping mechanisms are great some therapies are great anything that helps and is healthy is a positive direction what concerns me is your self branded character is simply that , unsubstantiated unvalidated diary entries making lite of a real medical condition this site should be renamed my reality of my anxiety any person in search of real data and hopeful of achieving real results founded on medical data and empirical research should avoid this site m really ? seriously ? i am all for reviews and comments , good or bad , but this was a bit on the harsh side on my opinion i guess i was under the impression that people who suffer from social anxiety was more sensitive to the feelings of others , but i guess this is not always the case rather than let this ruin what was starting out to be a good day , i have decided to leave my thoughts on this and then forget about it and move on let me explain what i believe this site is so as to not confuse anyone this site is a blog a blog as stated by dictionary com is an online diary a personal chronological log of thoughts published on a web page of course this is not a site strictly about the medical aspect of anxiety although i do dabble in that at times there are plenty of medical websites out there and i am not a doctor i post journal like entries , about me , because that 's all i can speak for i am not about to tell you how you feel or what your symptoms are i try to provide personal experiences that other people can relate with and hopefully learn from my mistakes or my successes its a place to draw inspiration , motivation , information , and mainly support this site is a place that i spend a lot of time and therefore i like to make it a place that is comfortable and uplifting i want it to be different from all the formal looking medical websites that are out there because again , its a blog i have learned in life that no matter how hard you try , you cannot please everyone and someone out there is n't going to like you anyway , i could go on but i do n't think it would do any good in other news , i quit blogging for healthyplace com because i did n't like how neglected this site had become hopefully i 'll be able to post more interesting and helpful blog posts in the future if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email
