hi all ! my plan is to give a monthly update rather than a weekly or biweekly in this case update , but i had some interesting developments in my life over the last couple of weeks and thought it was a good idea to share since one of the goals of this blog is to decrease stigma of mental illness , i should share my own experiences i got a bit burnt out on all the activities i 've been participating in as described in my september update quick summary , i 'd been working full time , volunteering hours a week at a crisis hotline , taking a credit abnormal psychology class as well as a credit emt class when i first signed up for the emt class , i had n't realized it was credits that was n't mentioned on the class description , so i did n't realize how hard it would be after a few weeks of it , i got so burnt out that i got really sick this was last week i decided to drop the emt class , and they were kind enough to let my tuition transfer to next semester i will not sign up for another class so i 'll be able to focus on the emt class in january then on monday , i had a hour anxiety attack i'm not sure how many of you have had anxiety attacks before , but they are n't supposed to last that long it 's sort of like running a marathon for hours this happened at work , and because i'm the manager , i ca n't call my boss and be like oh , gotta go home i simply had to finish the work it was an exhausting day the next day , i freaked out on my boyfriend for no reason other than our political differences , and then when i was trying to sleep i felt like a screaming monster was trying to claw its way out of my brain that 's when i realized i was in a bipolar mixed state bipolar mixed states have characteristics of both depression and mania they 're very dangerous because they have suicidal ideation mixed with impulsivity , motivation , and energy mixed state people are much more likely to commit suicide than a depressed person , because depressed people often lack the energy and impulsivity , motivation , and energy to commit suicide yesterday , i called my psychiatrist but i got stuck in the labyrinthine maze of monsters that is the park nicollet phone reception system one of the monsters even hung up on me , and i had to proceed to go without collecting my by the time i got through to the nurse an hour later , i was rather worked up she calmly told me that this is not a crisis line , and i should call crisis connection where , by the way , i volunteer i practically yelled at her that i did n't want a crisis hotline , i wanted to talk to my psychiatrist she made an appointment for me to see her later that afternoon i also made an emergency appointment with my therapist , who i have n't seen since march in the end , my psychiatrist tweaked my mood stabilizer and gave me a prescription to klonopin , which is a benzodiazepine an addictive sedative i'm a little worried since addiction runs in my family , and when i start getting symptoms of mania or apparently mixed symptoms i start craving alcohol , pain meds , and other such things i'm not much of drinker , and i'm not in the habit of taking unprescribed pain meds , but i crave them all the same so getting permission to take a benzodiazepine is a little troubling to me however , i recognize that i need it in situations like those described earlier in my post on a happier note , i was able to go to the nobel conference at gustavus adolphus college on tuesday and wednesday the theme was addiction , and my abnormal psychology prof took a bunch of his students there were speakers and they were all really interesting one of the speakers was marc lewis , the author of the biology of desire , which i just finished it turns out marc lewis is a bit annoying he kept trying to push his point that addiction is a choice and not a disease , until eric kandel , the nobel prize laureate in medicine , told him it 's either bullshit or science another speaker , carl hart , who is big on social justice , tried to break the tension by saying i did n't know we could swear at this conference ! and then the next day during hart 's speech he said and to quote dr kandel , this is bullshit ! it was a pretty amusing conference of course , the science was really interesting too , but i plan on writing a review both of the conference and of biology of desire , so i 'll stop here i'm currently reading or listening to books completed movies shows watched
