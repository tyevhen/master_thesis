february oil on canvas x i figured that the first post in this blog should be about one of the most important paintings i have ever done if not the most important february was created in the month of my mother suffering a major stroke it was devastating to say the least and , despite the utmost upheaval in my family 's life , i needed to continue to create paintings to prove to myself that this is what i am meant to do with my life and not merely a hobby therefore the painting is a visual representation of how i felt during that month , and subsequent months while my mother was in the hospital i wanted an uncomplicated composition , but one with impact i wanted to depict a visual paradox being claustrophobic within a spacious environment my body language reflects an almost fetal position while the air around me , normally refreshing , feels oppressive every time i look at this painting i remember that month
