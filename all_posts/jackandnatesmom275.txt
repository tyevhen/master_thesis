today was nate 's rd birthday i 'll be honest , last year , our family was in such a state that i literally cancelled nate 's nd birthday party , made it close family only so i guess i felt the need to make up for that on some level , even though i know he 's not really aware that he missed anything at the same time , he would not enjoy a big party he would be overwhelmed , overstimulated , and would be likely to have a meltdown i was a bit disappointed that several of our friends were not able to make it initially , but in the end i think it was for the best i would say that nate was a bit overstimulated even with a smaller party i was finally able to pinpoint something that nate really loves this year so i took the idea and ran with it really simple balloons ! they were everywhere and nate noticed right away this morning i started hanging these balloon banners that i made and his eyes got so big i really do feel like he knew that today was about him , although he does n't understand the whole birthday concept one thing that made me really proud this morning big brother jack gave nate his gift , helped him open it , told him happy birthday and hugged him and nate noticed the gift a duck and goose book and stuffed duck and goose i have been working with jack to help him understand a bit better the idea that he can give , he is not always going to be the receiver it 's been a tough concept for him the party went well , great group of people , all of whom really care about natey and understand where he is no surprised looks when he ran back and forth , collapsed on the floor , or stood on his head he did sneak to the treat table and snatch some stuff which tickled me that meant he was paying attention to his surroundings i even took one of my first risks since the boys were diagnosed nate has a little buddy from his old aba class which means they occasionally acknowledged each other 's presence , and his mom and i have been in that friday speech class together so i invited their family , which was a huge leap of faith for me letting someone new into our lives and i am so glad that i did they are new to the area , and have a special needs child , which must be a lonely place to be such a nice family , and hopefully , some new friends friends that understand fully what it 's like to be raising our kids jack did pretty well , other than a minor argument with a little girl over the christmas tree lights did great during the birthday song , as i had tasked him with helping nate blow his candles out not even a hint of a meltdown we did a simple craft , played with balloons including those punch balloons remember them ? , and had cake it was a good time and why would n't jack wear his airplane tie ? ? ? so what was inevitable on what i would consider a good day ? mommy 's feelings , that 's what i feel guilty about it i am happy that everyone had a good time , that there were no issues but it is milestones like today that make me realize what a huge amount of work we have to do when i see nate next to his neurotypical peers , it 's almost too much jack may seem a bit quirky to me most people do n't even notice in groups , but nate just does n't even live in the same neighborhood he spent about of the party playing with ribbon that was used to tie up the balloons and he ate he acknowledged his little friend a few times and sat at the table with the other kids he even said a few phrases of course he also showed off his new skill of knocking over our furniture kid is strong i managed to smile the whole way through the party after everyone left , we tried to sit down with my parents to have nate open a gift or two he had zero interest less than zero he was annoyed by our intrusion he wanted the ribbon he had been playing with my parents are very good sports , and understand the situation , but it hurts to watch it i mean , what would a typical three year old do with a pile of presents ? rip into them ! we tried to open about gifts today the only thing he played with was this stuffed mouse that came with one of his toys it has a long dangly tail so he could swing it around i did it i broke down i left the room , and i made it until everyone , even my parents , had left i had a good cry i am proud that he is three i am proud of how hard he has worked but i am sad and it 's not going to go away it 's so hard to watch him in his own little world in these circumstances , and feel so helpless to get through to him , to help him enjoy things that other children his age would adore he did not miss out today , not for him he enjoyed all of his day but as his mommy , i wish , well so many things , but most of all , today i wish he could have blown out his own candles and enjoyed his presents
