i'm headed to another party tonight it 's a party with co workers , who i have n't spent much if any time with over the past three months , but i'm still looking forward to it of course , if you read my last post , you 'll also understand why i'm a bit anxious i'm concerned about a crash similar to that which i experienced after the new year 's eve parties but that concern is not keeping me home speaking of my last post , i was n't sure anyone would understand it , so i was surprised and relieved to hear from so many of you who totally understood ! i'm sorry many of us have experienced the mood crash following a happy , social event , yet it was a relief to know i was n't weird or alone thank you for your comments relating similar experiences even if it does n't make a lot of sense , the crash is obviously not that unusual we are not alone i 've been doing better since late new year 's day i 've slowly climbed out of the crash zone in fact , i ran miles in the last three days , including a miler this morning , outside , prior to the deep freeze we are apparently about to experience the running is still more difficult than i would like it to be it is clear i am still slowly rebuilding , and still carrying extra pounds , but it is getting easier bit by bit i'm grateful for that i 've not much more to report today i 'll let you know how the party , and the party aftermath , goes i'm expecting it to be a lot of fun i work with a very fun group of people it will be nice to see them outside the office stay warm out there , my friends and keep putting one foot in front of the other after all , forward is the only way to go
