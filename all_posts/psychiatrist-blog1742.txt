dr richard schloss posed the following conundrum recently the following vignettes are sometimes used to illustrate that there are universal moral standards that transcend religion , culture , and ethnicity , because everyone , regardless of background or belief system , always gives the same answers see what you think suppose there is a runaway trolley car that is about to mow down and kill people now suppose that there is one observer standing next to the track watching this , and he realizes that , by throwing a switch , he can divert the car onto a different track so that it will kill only one person , but spare the other virtually everyone says that the morally correct thing to do is to throw the switch and sacrifice one person to save most even go so far as to say that it would be morally reprehensible for him just to stand there and do nothing , once he realizes that throwing the switch is an option now , a different scenario there is a hospital with patients who will die very soon if they do not receive organ transplants , and there are no donors immediately available they all need different organs now , suppose someone is brought into the emergency department of that hospital after having suffered a life threatening , but easily repairable , injury and he has and organ donor card in his wallet would it be ethical for the er staff to deliberately withhold treatment and let him die so that his organs can be used to save the other patients ? everyone says no to this question why ? how is it different from the trolley car scenario ? are n't they both cases of sacrificing one to save ? why is it right to do so in the first case , but wrong in the second ? and why does everyone , regardless of background , give the same answers to these two illustrations ? just for fun , i 'd like to throw a few qualifiers into the second scenario would your answer change if the potential organ donor who can be easily saved , but will die without treatment , had been driving drunk ? would it change if he were a paroled murderer ? what about if he had been speeding at the time of his accident and had killed a family in another vehicle ? discuss
