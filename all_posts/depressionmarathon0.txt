as i mentioned in a few previous posts , i 've been having some discomfort and locking of my right knee , typically the day after a run it has n't interrupted my running the discomfort has not been terrible , but it 's been concerning , especially when my knee intermittently locked up the locking made me believe i had a medial meniscus tear for that reason i had an mri earlier this week and saw my orthopedic doctor on friday we were both surprised my medial meniscus looked great the medial meniscus may have looked great , but the bone spur on my femur did n't look so good there 's not supposed to be a bone spur on the end of the femur there 's especially not supposed to be a bone spur right beneath the patella , a spur which is literally carving a matching groove in the underside of my patella apparently , that was the problem since the bone spur is carving up my patella , it 's fairly important it be removed so i'm having arthroscopic right knee surgery this thursday it should be a fairly simple procedure , especially since the rest of my knee anatomy looked so good my doc will take a burr to the spur and file it off i'm hoping to be back at work by monday and back to running within a few weeks and i'm looking forward to a pain free right knee onward and upward , my friends !
