now i 'll review the other major dietary observational studies regarding depressive disorders dietary patterns and depressive symptoms among japanese men and women men and women filled out dietary surveys and mental health questionnaires once again three dietary patterns were identified and those who ate fruits , vegetables , mushrooms , and soy called the healthy japanese diet group were less depressed vegetarian diets are associated with healthy mood states a cross sectional study in seventh day adventist adults vegan seventh day adventists were compared with omnivorous seventh day adventists the vegans reported a much higher intake of flax oil an omega fatty acid , ala and linoleic acid omega fatty acid the plasma and tissue if the participants were not measured for their fat content , but vegans generally have a red blood cell phospholipid ratio omega to omega of compared to in omnivores also , the vegans were generally happier ! see table association of the mediterranean dietary pattern with the incidence of depression , spanish men were followed for an average of years participants were each given a mediterranean diet compliance score based on positive points for consuming vegetables , fruit and nuts , cereal , legumes , and fish , a good monounsaturated to saturated fatty acids ratio , and moderate alcohol consumption participants got a negative score for meat and whole fat dairy over those years , new cases of depression were identified as in the other two studies , anyone with depression or taking an antidepressant medication at the beginning was excluded from the study in general , the higher the diet compliance score , the less depressed the participants were , with intake of monounsaturated fats , nuts , fruits , and legumes seeming to be especially protective anxiety and depression in adult patients with celiac disease on a gluten free diet germans primarily women with celiac disease on a gluten free diet were compared with a group of germans with inflammatory bowel disease crohn 's or ulcerative colitis and a group of normal controls women with ibd and celiac disease were both more anxious than the controls men seemed to be serene no matter what adherence to the gluten free diet did n't seem to matter much with regards to level of anxiety in a related study , anxiety improved in patients with celiac disease in a year on a gluten free diet , but not depression in summary we get the usual mish mash with the observational studies vegan seventh day adventists are happy folks german women with celiac disease tend to be anxious , and the mediterranean diet appears to be protective against depression , at least in spanish men ! the most surprising finding for the researchers in any of the studies appeared to be the happy vegans , given the strong evidence in prospective trials for an antidepressant effect from fish oils while limiting the study to seventh day adventists was meant to be a control , it may mean that you ca n't generalize the results to the rest of the vegans and omnivores in the world i know very little about seventh day adventists , but maybe eating vegan every day as a religious practice is self affirming and has an antidepressant effect of its own , for example clearly , though , the omega to omega ratio is not the end all , be all factor in the brain stuff to keep in mind !
