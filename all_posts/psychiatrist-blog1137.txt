i'm working on a way to make this post about psychiatry sort of getting there in today 's ny times magazine , peggy orenstein notes in the way we live now the overextended family , that she does n't want to skype videochat with her parents too much intrusion , there need to be some boundaries orenstein likes sending digital pictures , she does n't like email and somehow , she 's aware that while she 's not sure she wants to videochat with her folks , she recognizes that she might want to chat with her kids to skype or not to skype , that is the question but answering it invokes a larger conundrum how to perform triage on the communication technologies that seem to multiply like tribbles instant messaging , texting , cellphones , softphones , ichat , facebook , myspace , twitter how to distinguish among those that will truly enhance intimacy , those that result in t m i and those that , though pitching greater connectedness , in fact further disconnect us from the people we love she goes on to write video chat , while obviously cheaper , would seem to have the same skewed ratio too much access , too little control but that s speaking from the standpoint of a daughter my perspective shifts significantly as it does on so many subjects when i mull this one over as a mother it s one thing to consider how much about me my parents have a right to know it s another to contemplate how much about my daughter i have a right to know or even want to know i suppose the article caught my attention because i have a couple of those teenager people one goes to college a half a country away , and when i suggested we videochat , i was told he does n't do that he 'll email , he 'll talk actually , it 's more grunting , and the most reliable form of communication is the text message , but he 's not interested in im ing me , videochatting , or being my friend on facebook he does n't follow me on twitter , and somehow i doubt he reads shrink rap so the psychiatry tie in ? oh , roy would feel no need to look for one this time , i 'll let it go
