it 's been almost complete weeks since i began training seriously again with one exception , i 've run days per week every week , just as my schedule dictated i 've also run the miles called for at each workout in previous training cycles , neither of the above were true when i created and followed my own schedule , i often tinkered with the mileage and many times missed days following the runner 's world schedule , and revealing only one week of the schedule at a time , seems to be working for me i 've been able to focus on the present , keep motivated , and stay on track i'm starting to feel like a runner again training runs have gotten easier i'm feeling lighter i'm racing often and finally , my race times are coming down ! i ran a tough , tough cross country race last night this year my finishing time was two minutes faster than last year 's time in a k race , that 's a notable improvement ! so things are improving , and i'm starting to feel like a runner again it sure is nice when hard work pays off i 'll keep plugging away one mile at a time artwork by vicki varvaressos
