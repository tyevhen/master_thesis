i'm feeling overwhelmed today i think i 've got too much going on my head is trying to keep everything straight , but i feel like i'm running in a million different directions i have lists of things to do , things to look up , things to buy , errands to run , people to call , and chores to be done on top of that , i'm in the midst of the most difficult , and time consuming , week of my triathlon training it 's all getting to be a bit too much i'm worried about work tomorrow i have a start of care to do that means i will be the first provider from my agency to meet with a new patient most of the time the nurses are the first ones into the home , and i come along later but tomorrow it will be me , and it will be the first time i 'll be doing a start of care it 's a very lengthy process i'm told it takes at least hours in the patient 's home and then another hours of paperwork so i'm stressed about that i'm also stressed about my remodeling project , which hit a major snag today my plumbing rough in failed inspection it did n't just fail it failed miserably it needs to be torn out and re done does anyone know a good plumber ? this means more work , more time , and most unfortunately , more money for me we 're just getting started and already the dollars are adding up this is not a hopeful sign despite having to wait for the plumbing inspector for three hours , i did get my workouts in today i started my day early with a strength training class , but i did n't get on my bike until after pm i did a brick workout i rode for minutes followed by an immediate minute run it went okay my legs were very tired on the bike , and i had some cramping in my calves during my run not typical for me not sure what that was all about maybe it was the stress wearing me out looking ahead , things do n't get any simpler i 'll be up and in the pool early tomorrow because after work i have a golf lesson followed by a softball game ! i'm not sure when i 'll squeeze in the run there are a few too many things on my plate at the moment i 'll really have to work on staying in the moment and taking things one day at a time looking ahead is too overwhelming i need to stop doing that one moment at a time , right ? taking just one moment at a time will eventually get me through i think i hope
