as remembrance day rolls around again , and marks the th anniversary of wwi , i find myself looking at the ceremonies in a different light than i ever have before i always just looked at the veterans , tears running down their faces as memories i ca n't even begin to imagine pass through their heads for the millionth time , remembering all the friends that passed away so long ago , all the horrific things they 've seen , looked at them and felt so terribly sad i still do feel so sad when i look at them , but now that sadness is overshadowed by anger i hear the speeches , hear the broadcasters words , see the formal ceremony on tv , and i ca n't help but feel that , almost unknowingly , they 're glorifying war they say honor our veterans , for they fought for freedom , they fought to end war they say they 're fighting now to bring peace but how can fighting bring peace ? ? i do honor our veterans my heart breaks a little when i see the look in their eyes but i think there 's something far more important than honoring those veterans , empty feelings that do n't change anything , and that something is simply stopping it all there 's a line from a song that really wrung true with me , even though i took it entirely out of context they all cry bloody murder over graves already dug people always bring up the holocaust , quite possibly the most well known tragedy of the past century , and i find it rather ironic when people say , as they often seem to , never again , as if the holocaust was a uniquely horrible event there have been other genocides there are currently genocides happening as i write this the soldiers in wwi fought the war to end all wars and that still seems to be the party line , although so many more wars have happened since the great war so here are the things i think the youth , me , my sister , my friends , my friends friends , youth worldwide , need to do first , we must know about the wars that have happened , understand the truth behind why they were fought , not just the propaganda we hear about from schools and governments that seem to subtly imply war is a not so bad , or at least necessary , thing to understand , and to never forget in that i agree with the government we must never forget but instead of being grateful , instead of sitting back , confident that our countries soldiers will take care of us by fighting some morally right war , look into the veterans eyes , look at the pain there , and say never again not now , not in the future i will not subject people to that , it has to stop that 's what we need to do fighting does n't end war as i write this i'm still slightly teary , in part because i'm not sure how much i can actually do as usual , i feel like i only have half of the answer i know we need to do something , i'm just not sure quite how to go about it i just finished listening to one of the in my opinion most powerful anti war songs ever written , and tears ran down my face it feels so true now , even though it was written nearly half a century ago i give you the lyrics here , and i urge you to listen to this song universal soldier http ca youtube com watch ? v jimjvgjfvm feature related i think this version sounds the best , but do n't watch the video as it 's out of sync he 's five foot two , and he 's six feet four , he fights with missiles and with spears he 's all of thirty one , and he 's only seventeen , been a soldier for a thousand years he'a a catholic , a hindu , an atheist , a jain , a buddhist and a baptist and a jew and he knows he should n't kill , and he knows he always will , kill you for me my friend and me for you and he 's fighting for canada , he 's fighting for france , he 's fighting for the usa , and he 's fighting for the russians , and he 's fighting for japan , and he thinks we 'll put an end to war this way and he 's fighting for democracy , he 's fighting for the reds , he says it 's for the peace of all he 's the one who must decide , who 's to live and who 's to die , and he never sees the writing on the wall but without him , how would hitler have condemned him at dachau ? without him caesar would have stood alone , he 's the one who gives his body as a weapon of the war , and without him all this killing ca n't go on he 's the universal soldier and he really is to blame , his orders come from far away no more , they come from him , and you and me , and brothers ca n't you see , this is not the way we put the end to war other anti war songs i find particularly touching hero of war by rise against where have all the flowers gone by pete seeger blowin' in the wind by bob dylan i personally like the peter paul and mary cover remembrance , and peace , idzie
