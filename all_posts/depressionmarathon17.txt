not much to report from here i'm living life on life 's terms at the moment fortunately , life 's terms are n't too dramatic or difficult to deal with right now i 've continued to work days per week , rather than my usual , in an effort to recoup some of the funds lost to my month hiatus from work it 's tiring , and i 've fallen behind on some household chores , but so far i 've been able to keep up with my exercise , which is most important for my mental health speaking of exercise , i tried to run again a few days ago it was maybe a little better than the last time i tried , but my left leg still wo n't fully support me or cooperate it 's still weaker and less stable than my right leg i'm a little more hopeful it will recover fully , but the progress is so , so slow , and the improvement so , so minuscule , it 's hard to hang onto that hope the road back is going to be very long i'm trying to be patient despite my patience being tested , my mood remains good i'm so grateful i worked with someone today who was very negative every other thought , even thoughts which began positively , somehow ended up blatantly negative it was tiring and sad i'm so thankful i have a different perspective it 's easy to find the negative but why focus on it ? life is so short energy is so precious i ca n't imagine wasting it like that so i do n't i know negative i 've lived negative i'm grateful i do n't find it necessary to stay there life on life 's terms takes energy enough seek the positive , my friends
