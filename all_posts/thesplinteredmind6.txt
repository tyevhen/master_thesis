this has been a tough year for me i ve kept my struggle mostly secret because the drama that ails me relates a story that i cannot share the results of it are fairly obvious to those who observe me day to day , however i m less cheery i m more stressed my sleep is horrible i m way behind in my writing my finances have thrown up a white flag i don t find relief in social media anymore and my real social life has evaporated like water in the hot , utah sun the most unfortunate aspect of the drama is that the more stress i encounter , the worse my tourette s becomes still ! during all of this , i fulfill all my duties as a dad , and plug forward there is always a dawn on the other side of the darkness i believe that completely , but these days i don t have extra energy or time for writing books or articles i thought i had a handle on things , albeit my life was full time daddy work and no freelance , but then i woke up a few days ago and thought that life would be easier if i removed myself from it i haven t had a suicidal thought in years , so that thought shocked me upright i immediately engaged my coping strategies step one i texted my daughters and let them know i had a suicidal thought step two i couldn t set an appointment checkup with a therapist because i can t currently find one nearby that works with my insurance plan so i did something proactive instead step three i went out for a walk in the bright sunlight i talked to myself along the way , analyzing my thoughts and identifying the elements that had brought me to suicidism again i made an action plan i made goals i chased off that black dog with all the sticks that i could muster and it worked unfortunately , none of this sadness and worry has anything to do with my clinical depression i say unfortunately because if it was just depression keeping me down , i d have overcome all this by now my tool belt doesn t have anything to offset external forces that dump concrete on my chipper attitude i can manage the feelings i get after emerging from the wreckage , but nothing i do can stop the unrelenting pressures of family drama delivered by the truckload what on earth is happening to you , douglas ? ! you may fairly shout stop teasing already ! again , it s not my story to tell , but i can say that it s an ordeal i can t walk away from after over a year of this , with a crescendo in the past few months , i have to admit that it is time for a new set of coping strategies i am not writing fiction as i had planned because i can t justify the time spent on it i am not writing in this blog except sporadically for the same reason my new york editor over at additude magazine probably thinks i m blowing him off because i haven t submitted work in weeks , but it s hard to write a humor article when my smile is lost in the chaos and lastly , i had suicidal thoughts a clear indication that it is time for a change maybe i don t need to toss out my old coping strategies , but i certainly need to replace them temporarily with something better tailored for the current stresses life changes and we need to change with it sometimes , the forces of life that work against us aren t always internal we need to have coping strategies prepared for when things become hard to bear i don t feel like i m swimming through turbulent waters as much as i am afloat with my mouth slightly above water as i get carried along in the current i m getting air , but i have no control over the direction that i m taking unless i make changes , i ll simply continue to take damage the truth is that life flows on regardless of our swimming skills either we adapt , or we get carried under with that in mind , i m writing this blog post as a way of casting anchor , but also to let you know that i haven t forgotten about this space on the internet i haven t succumbed i still win the fight against depression and suicide every day i m , also , overcoming my adhd i have plenty of attitude i m just very , very short on humor ah drama calls here s to smiles and peace in the future here s to leaving drama in the past i write a lot about fighting suicide as well as depression it is my hope that you find something here to help you in your battle i also wrote a book on overcoming suicide that many people have found helpful
