first off , i want to apologize for the lack of posts lately first my internet went down and i had to replace my modem and router and i went through a few days of serious internet withdrawals now my husband has been sick with strep throat and possibly the swine flu ahh ! tonight is the first time i feel like i have some time to relax and actually think so my relaxation has n't been where i have wanted it to be so far this month , thats for sure i have made the deep breathing techniques one of the first things i do when i start to panic so i am glad that i have already been able to incorporate that into my normal routine awhile back i used to have a player on the site that had some music that i found to help me to relax music has a way of lifting depressed moods and touching souls edmund j bourne says , whether you use music while driving , as a background while at work , or in the foreground when you want to take time out to relax , it is one of the most powerful and time honored methods for letting go of anxiety or worry if you use the music to assuage anxiety , be sure to select pieces that are genuinely relaxing rather than stimulating or emotionally evocative bold and italics added i grew up playing the piano and used to teach lessons i have always found that playing the piano and listening to piano music really helps me to get lost from my daily worries and really feel at peace a couple of my favorite piano musicians are john schmidt and jim brickman i feel a little vulnerable sharing this with you for some reason i think its just because its so special to me , and its a part of me , a part of my heart , and i do n't want people to think its stupid but i 'll take the risk because i think the following is worth it while this song is n't jon schmidt 's most relaxing one , it is the most amazing peice i have ever heard he is so talented and i have been trying to learn this song for years , but its sooo hard he actually uses his entire arm for several of the notes near the end its titled , all of me you can check out a live performance here here is another one of my favorites by him just listening to these to put on here is putting me in such a happy mood , i love it and now for a really relaxing one , this is by jim brickman the song is called lake erie rainfall and it has a special place in my heart because i grew up literally down the street from lake erie and that lake truly is home to me being away from it now for years really makes me homesick when i listen to the song , but its also a very peaceful song i hope you enjoy it as much as i do and finally , the first jim brickman song that i ever heard is still one of my all time favorites its just a beautiful song the following are some songs that are n't necessarily relaxing like enya or yanni relaxing , but they are cool songs that i used to listen to to help me feel better about my anxiety natasha bedingfield wild horses frou frou let go daniel bedingfield gotta get through this acoustic and finally , jem it 's just a ride i like to listen to music in the car , when getting ready for the day , and when cooking dinner most of what i listen to is on the more mellow side specifically because it helps me to relax more thanks for listening ! what kind of music do you listen to , to unwind and relax ? i 've also started a topic about this on the forum if you would rather leave your suggestions there if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email
