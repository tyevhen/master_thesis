i actually read the paper today , which i have n't done in a while i learned even more about how depressing a place the democratic republic of congo is there 's a civil war going on now , and thousands of girls and women are being raped by the official military , the militia , and their own neighbors reading that really made me sad i also read a cool piece on organic farming i also did some more research into paganism on that note , since i have n't mentioned it in any of my posts yet , i'm pagan the best description would be eclectic paganism i believe most of the stuff found in wicca , but i do n't like all the rules and hierarchy that comes with it i 've realized recently that a few of my beliefs can be described as animist , and i also have some beliefs that seem to be all my own i really enjoy finding out more about all the different pagan religions i'm very happy with the path , or at least the direction , that i have chosen it just feels right to me on a different note , quiet day overall i hung out outside for a bit , soaking up the good weather argued with people i do n't like , talked to people i do like and that 's about it listening to today prayer of the refugee by rise against reading the newspaper you might also like unschooling in the news it begins in fire old newspapers and magazines a very little bit about animism linkwithin
