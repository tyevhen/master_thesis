question hi a b curtis , i ve read and love your books and wanted to say thank you for all the great information i was wondering what your take is on ptsd and how to deal with it or treat it i'm also thinking about seeing a therapist for help with a dysfunctional relationship i'm in , and with getting my life more organized , what type of therapy would you recommend and what types to avoid thank you response ptsd is a problem with brain chemistry in that one cannot get out of the fight or flight response and therefore suffers with chronic anxiety another good book for chronic anxiety is by dr claire weekes called hope and help for your nerves as far as relationship problems if you are not dysfunctional yourself , you cannot be in a dysfunctional relationship once you get yourself functional you will be able to help others the problem today is that all the institutions that used to support functional relationships have disappeared the functional unit of any society is the family when that is downgraded , we are all adrift and don t know where the heck we are or where we are going or why it s not just you , who are searching for some kind of sanity this whole culture is you are definitely not alone read some books by wayne dyer , deepak chopra just keep looking for higher ground i would also suggest meditation hope this helps some if you have specific questions about specific interactions i can help with that we have to start small and build on that a b curtiss
