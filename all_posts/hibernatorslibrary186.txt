as mentioned in my opening post about personality disorders , personality disorders are split into three clusters a , b , and c this post will discuss cluster b people with these disorders tend to be dramatic , emotional , and erratic patients with histrionic personality disorder are characterized by self dramatization , over concern with attractiveness , tendency to irritability , and temper outbursts if attention seeking is frustrated these patients often manipulate their partners with seductive behavior , but they are also tend to be very dependent on the partners' attention they are generally considered self centered , vain , shallow , and insincere these traits are much more commonly seen in women than in men probably because many of the characteristics like over concern with appearance tend to be women 's traits in fact , some argue that histrionic personality disorder is just another form of anti social personality disorder , which is much more prevalent in men in order to be diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder , the patient must have or more of the following traits she is uncomfortable in situations in which she is not the center of attention her interactions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or provocative behaviors she displays rapidly shifting and shallow expression of emotions she consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention to herself she has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in detail she shows self dramatization , theatricality , and exaggerated expression of emotion she is suggestible i e easily influenced by others or circumstances she considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are this is one of the personality disorders that will be dispensed with if the next dsm moves towards a dimensional model of diagnosis , as mentioned in my earlier post narcissistic personality disorder is characterized by grandiosity , preoccupation with receiving attention , self promoting , and lack of empathy there are two types grandiosity and vulnerable narcissism in the former , the patient is convinced of their superiority in the latter the patient expresses superiority defensively due to a low self esteem narcissistic personality disorder is observed more often in men than in women in order to be diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder , the patient must meet five or more of the following traits he has a grandiose sense of self importance exaggerates achievements and talents , expects to be recognized as superior he is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success , power , brilliance , beauty , or ideal love he believes that he is special and unique and can only be understood by , or should associate with , other special people he requires excessive admiration he has a sense of entitlement he is interpersonally exploitative he lacks empathy and is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings or needs of others he is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him he shows arrogant , haughty behaviors now , i doubt my ex boyfriend had a personality disorder , but he did have quite a few of these traits possibly exacerbated by a lifetime of alcoholism which he had only recently given up when i 'd met him in fact , at one point in our relationship , he went to a neurologist to be checked for long term side effects of a past concussion , and he returned with a psychological assessment which said he had narcissistic personality traits at the time , i had laughed it off , but later i began to see it this guy thought that he was incredibly smart , good looking , and absolutely amazing at his job he was always bragging about the quality of his work however , i saw some of his work a couple of times and found it lacking which i did n't say , of course he was always talking about the future how he had so many offers for jobs he was unemployed and how he 'd be making well over , a year in no time he surrounded himself with people that he saw as superior yes , that includes myself he was always bragging to everyone about how smart and beautiful i was it was rather embarrassing and over the top he also showed a surprising lack of empathy he felt that anxiety was a sign of weakness in others , but when he had anxiety attacks he felt it was uncontrollable rather than a weakness narcissistic personality disorder is one of the disorders that would be dropped if the diagnosis switched to a dimensional rather than cluster approach because there is a lot of public interest in borderline personality disorder and antisocial psychopathy , i will mention those cluster b disorders in another post this is a
