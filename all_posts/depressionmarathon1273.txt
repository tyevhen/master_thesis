i thought it only fitting to end the wild month of april with an actual photo , taken april , , of two actual deer in a backyard in togo , minnesota togo is in the northeast part of the state near duluth , mn the deer , and everyone else in togo , recently received inches of snow ! hmmm does anyone else recognize this feeling ? or is it just me ?
