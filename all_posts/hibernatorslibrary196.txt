photo of the month pumpkin selfie wow this was quite the month most of it is fuzzy due to my bipolar mixed state which gobbled up most of my conscious activity but i'm starting to emerge , thankfully at some point , i decided to choose this crying piggy bank as my monthly topper probably because i spent a huge chunk of money on my new contact lenses , but it may also have been because the picture 's really darned cute i 've decided to include it now , even though it does n't summarize the month as well as i 'd expected at one foggy moment in a long foggy month i 'd say more about my month , but i'm a bit foggy so i 'll let the posts and pictures say the rest i'm currently reading or listening to abnormal psychology posts clinical mental health diagnosis biological assessment clinical mental health diagnosis psychological assessment does the dsm encourage overmedication ?
