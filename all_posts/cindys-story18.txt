sometimes it is in the most difficult places that we realize what we really need i wrote this during a time when i was struggling in high school it is hard sometimes when we ca n't actually physically feel the touch of our god that is what i wanted like a little girl who wants her loving daddy to wrap his arms around her and keep her safe , that is what i wanted from god daddy god , i need you by cindy boersma my god i know if i could just crawl into your lap snuggle up inside your big strong arms feel your love as you hold me i could keep safe from all that harms if i could stay as long as i needed as if time were standing still if i could rest as you watch over me and know that you always will then maybe i could take it these trials i'm going through they are wearing me out and breaking me down i do n't know what to do daddy god , i need you
