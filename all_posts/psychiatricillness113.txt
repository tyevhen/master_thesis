i keep imagining ways to end it all but that 's not what i want i have just had a bath and got dressed i just feel clean and miserable now i do n't want to go back to work , i ca n't face it hopefully i will feel better by monday i think i will just try and clear up and do some laundry today it is probably better than doing nothing it might keep my mind occupied i liked being physically ill it kind of gave my mind a rest my mind needs a kick start now as the emptyness leaves a void for the negative thoughts to sneak in there are many many negative thoughts at the moment too mainly regarding my ability at work
