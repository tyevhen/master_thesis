yesterday i went to my first mental health support group a recovery , inc , meeting i knew nothing about this organization , although i know a lot about the mental health consumer recovery movement in general recovery , inc , is based on the work of abraham a low , md we listened to the audiotape of one of his lectures , which was kinda difficult to follow because he uses a lot of fancy language but every so often a nugget of knowledge would jump out at me and i 'd see how what he was saying applied to my life yesterday 's meeting focused on temper and why it 's more important to stay cool and calm than argue with someone over something trivial anger certainly exacerbates anxiety , so i found the meeting useful especially the group discussion after the lecture i bought one of dr low 's books and intend to read it the group members were very friendly , so i intend to go back next week maybe this is the beginning of something wonderful for me
