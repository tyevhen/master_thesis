one year ago , my life changed direction i was fighting with a health issue that not only depleted my energy but caused me pain , anguish , and fear to this day , i remain undiagnosed , left with the doctor s parting remark , we ll probably never know what it is or why it happened i translated this to mean just get on with it so i did ! i chose to take control of my life and health it was the hardest decision to make but in hindsight , it was the right one after seven years of hard work , i closed body soul holistics , my holistic health spa a small business that had evolved and flourished until i had an eight month waiting list for ladies wanting treatments my clients were incredible and supported my decision , having watched my health deteriorate before their eyes they were also wise and intuitive about where my life would take me knowing i enjoyed writing my books , they all believed that the universe was giving me a push in this direction everything happens for a reason was batted around a lot so , today , one year on , i still struggle with my symptoms , but i try not to let them get me down when i get tired , i stop what i m doing and rest i know my limitations and plan my days around them i m still in contact with many of my lovely clients who make my day with their messages life is very different , but it s good i chose to take control of my life and health it s been difficult at times , mentally , physically and financially , but i know in my heart that it was the right thing to do i faced fear , looked it straight in the eye and still jumped off the cliff i knew i could grow my wings on the way down thank you to everyone who has followed my story , supported me in so many ways , whether that s in real life or online your encouragement and kind words have meant more to me than i could ever say i m still fighting , and i m never going to quit in the meantime , i have books to write !
