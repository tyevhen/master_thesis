what a day was today , i went out shopping with a friend , was awesome , found some great clothes , shoes etc' , have n't finished with all the things i need yet , but its a huge step forward , some idiot mumbled a remark about my weight but i did n't care too much because i considered him to be an idiot , and there 's no reason why should listen to idiots , so it bothered me for like couple of minutes maybe less , than i forgot about it and went on having fun got me new sunglasses too , usually i would n't dare stepping into those stores but it was awesome , in some stage i just did n't care any more my mind was on different things totally , amazing , when i think about it now i focused on the outside email this blogthis ! share to twitter share to facebook reactions
