this is a brief explanation of contemporary psychoanalysis , and i provide links below for books , specifically on a type of contemporary psychoanalysis called relational psychoanalysis , for anyone who wants a more in depth understanding of contemporary psychoanalysis many people have the old stereotypical image of psychoanalysis as being the type of therapy where the client does all the talking while lying down on a couch and the psychoanalyst remains seated behind the client , quiet for long stretches at a time until she makes an interpretation to the client for the purpose of helping the client develop insight into his problems in the old stereotypical image of psychoanalysis , clients would come for multiple sessions per week , and this could go on for many years also , the analyst tended to remain abstinent and neutral and did not self disclose anything personal fortunately , very few psychoanalysts work this way any more contemporary psychoanalysis is different from older forms of psychoanalysis for instance , i consider myself to be a relational psychoanalyst , which is a form of contemporary psychoanalysis i work in an interactive , dynamic , empathetic and collaborative way with clients the number of times the client comes to therapy , whether the client sits up facing me or lays down on the couch or how long the client chooses to remain in therapy does n't take away from the fact that i'm using contemporary psychoanalysis even if i do n't make interpretations although i practice many different types of therapy , including emdr therapy , somatic experiencing , clinical hypnosis , contemporary psychoanalysis informs my work in terms of the way i conceptualize the client 's current problems , the importance of the unconscious mind and the transference aspects of therapy what is relational psychoanalysis ?

contemporary psychoanalysis and emdr therapy offer powerful therapeutic benefits separately but when they 're combined for trauma therapy , they offer the client the in depth insight of contemporary psychoanalysis and emdr 's relatively faster way of processing trauma among other aspects of emdr therapy , emdr helps clients to identify the negative beliefs that they have about themselves related to their trauma this negative belief is often rooted in family history and can often be found in many aspects of the client 's life for example , the negative belief related to the traumatic memory might be i'm unlovable , which is often part of other problems not just the one that they 're coming in to work on see my article overcoming the emotional pain of feeling unlovable for more details emdr therapy often has generalizable effects , which means that the therapist and client do n't have to work on every traumatic event related to the negative belief contemporary psychoanalysis offers the client an opportunity to appreciate the depth of the negative belief as well as other aspects of the trauma emdr therapy offers clients an opportunity to unlock information related to the trauma that is stored in a maladaptive way in the brain it allows for memory reconsolidation , which is one of the reasons why it works relatively quickly compared to other forms of trauma therapy combining emdr therapy and contemporary psychoanalysis provides the most powerful and effective aspects of in depth therapy with relatively brief therapy getting help in therapy if you have been suffering with unresolved psychological trauma , you owe it to yourself to get help from a trauma therapist see my article how to choose a psychotherapist resolving your trauma will free you from a history that has been keeping you stuck in your life rather than suffering on your own , you owe it to yourself to get help from a trauma therapist a skilled trauma therapist can help you to overcome the problems that are keeping you from maximizing your potential about me i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist with over years of experience i work with individuals and couples for clients who are already in therapy with therapists who do not do emdr therapy and who want to remain with their therapists , i also provide adjunctive emdr therapy so that clients can remain with their therapists see my article what is adjunctive emdr therapy ?
