his name was stanley , just like my friend who passed away almost one year ago i'm not sure of the meaning behind that , but it 's interesting he was years old , a minister for years , a husband , a father of five , and a patient of mine he was a very special man stanley died in the early hours of yesterday morning i'm sad as i 've told you before , stanley and i shared a special connection he was the most humble , serene , and peaceful man i had ever met gratitude and compassion emanated from him he was what i strive to be , and i was drawn to him from his obituary he was instrumental in securing a grant that was first in the nation for a migrant school he was also active in aa work he always enjoyed the youth of the church and took them on many camping trips after stan retired , he held part time jobs in the fields of youth and alcohol rehabilitation , and did fifth step work , among other things no wonder i was drawn to him it sounds like we had more in common than i knew stanley had told me about his fifth step work with recovering alcoholics , but a lot of ministers do fifth steps he never disclosed whether or not he was a member of aa it seems he may have been he certainly lived his life according to the principles i now hold dear i will not soon forget the example he set thank you , god , for allowing stanley 's path to intersect with mine i am grateful for the opportunity to know him he was a very special man rest in peace , stanley rest in peace
