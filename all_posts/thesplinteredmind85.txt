since identifying that depression had sunk its hooks in me , i 've been making a transformation in my life first , i stopped wearing black and listening to the cure , and i started wearing sepia and listening to bluegrass country tunes about lost dreams to really brighten my day whiskey lullaby , i ca n't love you anymore , if i die young , ghost in this house , and hurt gave me that little extra oomph i needed so bring on the pain , let it kill your memory bring on the rain , let it drown what 's left of you and me i know the only way i'm ever gonna make it , is burying the best of us even though it 's killing me 'cuz i do n't love you any less , but i ca n't love you anymore let me tell you it 's the small things that make a big difference wow am i happier actually , i am happier i fixed my bike flat and made myself go out for a ride on friday it was the first time out of the home in days and cemented the turning point i tend to listen to dance music to pick my spirits up with a set of vocal trance tracks loaded up on my iphone , i just rode until my heart felt as if it would burst , and i loved every moment of it today i'm feeling a bit down again due to a severe bout of insomnia over the weekend , so i 'll be heading out for another bike ride in a few moments friday night hours saturday night hours sunday hour nap sunday night hours oh yeah , irregular sleep is completely optimal for productivity and happiness i wo n't push as hard today on the bike for fear riding until my heart bursts might not be a good thing to achieve , but getting out will do me a galaxy of good and in another attempt to stick depression in the eye , i have set a writing goal for the day i will finish chapter four in snkrz today the only way to get to the end of this race is to stop sitting under the tree as a spectator and get up and ride today is crucial for overcoming depression if i do n't offset the sadness by force of will , it will become the only thing i feel again then i wo n't even be a spectator off to the races ! update my bike has another flat , dang it ! next time what dave farland told me about adhd follow me on twitter for my adhd escapades at splinteredmind or my novel writing project over at douglascootey and if you 're a glutton for punishment you can friend me on facebook as well
