question hi curtiss , hope you keeping well , these days losing control of my thinking , and seeking to raise the level of positiveness biased to sexual thoughts and behave through face expressions and eye gestures because of the repressed fear causing losing control need to get out from this fall i have been trying to get out from this from the last few days is unbalanced brain chemistry causes these symptoms since deep fear was holding me for few weeks thanks curtiss answer remember that will is destiny , biology is not destiny there is nothing more powerful than the human will to do better and we can always think a better thought a better thought will change our brain chemistry for the better just say to yourself , i m doing better and better then choose some mantra and meditate on that to keep the more destructive thoughts from bothering you when fear comes , acknowledge it , accept it and then the fear will diminish and you can move beyond it as for fear of losing control you can use cognitive behavioral thinking for this here s how i cured myself of claustrophobia which appears in my book depression is a choice ask yourself what , exactly are you afraid you will do physically with your body once you decide what that is , you can , at the same time , commit to the decision that you will not do that then what is left is just the fear again which you can accept , let it finish and move on here s the excerpt from my book i recently took a trip during which my regular method of handling claustrophobia utterly failed i have been successful with short trips , but this was a six hour flight to hawaii and i was stuck in the center of five seats on a fully loaded plane at first i concentrated on my book , but little doubts kept creeping into my concentration until i started to panic every atom of my body was screaming , i have to get out of here now ! ! ! i forced myself to check that the seat belt sign had been turned off , i excused myself by the other two passengers , and i bolted into the aisle saved ! i walked up and down for a while and did not have the courage to return to my seat they served breakfast and though i was hungry , i still couldn t sit down i was miserable my back started to hurt and so i sat down on the floor in the only available space i could find , which was near the lavatories but the smell was terrible and people started giving me odd and annoyed looks for which i could hardly blame them there were dozens of people perfectly fine in their seats i was the only nut case sitting down on the dirty floor where people were having to step over me i began to be ashamed to behave so ignominiously when the aisles were cleared from breakfast , i walked up and down for a while longer and then i tried to sit in the pull down stewardess seat but i was told it was against regulations my back was starting to hurt again from standing and i started to think about my situation i guessed i could stand up for another three hours but what kind of a fake was i that i was writing a book about brainswitching and i couldn t even control my own claustrophobia ? i began to study my situation , earnestly , in terms of what was the fear about not why was i afraid but what , exactly , was i afraid of ? i thought that i could control myself long enough to belt myself in for a landing , but i wanted to do better than that if i could i didn t want to be a phony was i going to put my money where my mouth was or what ? i didn t try to search for anything rational i knew that my terror was totally irrational my former success with claustrophobia , i now realized , was limited i could handle short flights in a three seat flying situation in a crowded auto i learned that i could control my panic if i could sit on the very edge of the seat or someone s lap , where my arms and legs were not confined , and lean into the space between the two front seats luckily i am not a large person , so i could usually maneuver a workable position but this was the middle seat of five , in a totally full airplane and i was terrified over the years i had just naturally avoided situations which were this uncomfortable i was able to get aisle seats in airplanes but not this time i had received my comeuppance i was thinking about all these things while i was studying my situation on the plane what exactly was i afraid would happen if i sat back down in the middle of those crowded seats ? that i would flail my arms around and scream ! well , i thought , that is just behavior , isn t it , and i m sure i can control my behavior so that i do not do that yes , i decided , i could depend upon my earnest commitment to not flail my arms around or scream so what did that leave ? the terror yes , i could do nothing to prevent the terror i would feel like i was dying i would feel like i couldn t breathe well , i thought , that is all just feeling , isn t it ? i just have to stand the physical pain of that terror i have to control my behavior and just feel the terror , just sit there quietly , even if i pass out , or die if that is my fate i decided i could do that i sat back down , buckled myself in and prepared to feel the most absolute terror of my life i opened myself up to whatever pain would come i was absolutely determined to bear the most unimaginably painful feelings , whatever they were the most amazing thing happened no terror came not even the smallest tinge of it i completed the rest of the flight in complete comfort now and then i invited the pain and terror if it wanted to come but it never did i think the whole key was to separate the gestalt of panic into its plain , more user friendly concomitants of behavior and feeling looking at the separate parts of my panic gave me a clue as to how to proceed i saw the panic in terms of tasks to accomplish , rather than fear to succumb to i could see that , although it might be difficult and painful , it was possible for me to control my behavior and keep myself from screaming or flailing my arms around and it was possible to bear any pain that my feelings were going to inflict upon me after all , they were my feelings , weren t they ? what could my own feelings do to me , really in two weeks , i would have to return from hawaii i determined to seek out the terror again and see what more work i had to do , or what new tortures my terror would teach me on my return trip , i found i had been given an aisle seat and i was tempted to let it go at that but because i felt obligated to finish this story for my book , however it turned out i told the clerk i was working on my claustrophobia so would she please give me the worst crowded up inside seat she could again i settled down quite prepared to feel the terror no matter what ! in the beginning i got just a few tendrils of panic and again i opened myself up to whatever horror would be visited upon me the tendrils of panic just faded out to nothing i felt perfectly comfortable the whole trip we can all make our life into something immensely satisfying regardless of the circumstances of it with the earnest desire to do so anybody can do it with a little practice a b curtiss
