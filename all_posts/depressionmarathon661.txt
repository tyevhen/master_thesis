i'm on vacation in the northwoods of wisconsin i'm visiting my parents they are residing at an rv park here for the summer we are nestled in the trees with the mosquitoes ! there are numerous lakes in this area , which is one of the reasons i'm here fishing ! i love to fish ! i got here on tuesday , late , after driving hours puck was still a little dopey from his surgery , so he rode fairly quietly the whole way we went fishing twice yesterday and got skunked no fish both times ! today we went out again for hours , but we only got a couple of small bass nonetheless , my mom is cooking up some bass right now ! tomorrow we will try again i'm also in the middle of my taper for grandma 's marathon , which is now only days away i just came in from an mile tempo run it was nice running among the trees and water i miss that i grew up around lakes , but the corner of minnesota in which i now reside lacks lakes it 's tough training when i am here with my parents they like good food , chocolate , fishing , and lounging it 's very relaxing , but not necessarily conducive to exercising i'm pretty proud of myself for getting out there today , especially after spending most of the day lounging with a fishing pole in my hand i brought my bike , too , and i found a local trail through the woods today that 's where i'm headed tomorrow my last long run , only miles , is saturday hopefully i have enough fortitude to stick to the schedule despite the temptations
