i'm doing a little studying up on binge eating and the brain , so this post is more of a notation aid for me so if you are n't a neuroscientist , you might want to just listen to this music from dissecting components of reward 'liking' , 'wanting' , and 'learning'' rewards ranging from sweet taste , iv cocaine , winning money and smiley face activate many brain regions orbitofrontal cortex , anterior cingulate and insula , and also nucleus accumbens , ventral pallidum , ventral tegmentum , mesolimbic dopamine projections , amygdala not clear which are the reward centers and which are activated as part of spreading network activation in response to reward in babies , primates , rats and mice , sweets elicit happy facial expressions while bitter tastes elicit negative expressions many brain systems are involved to enhance these liking reactions , we can count on the opioid , endocannabinoid , and gaba benzodiazepine neurotransmitter systems in the limbic system these are known as the hedonic hotspots one example is a tiny spot within the nucleus accumbens , about a milimeter in volume , comprising less than of the nucleus accumbens microinject a mu opiate agonist into the hotspot , liking in response to sucrose increases it also doubles the wanting for food demonstrated by increased eating behavior and food intake microinject opiate outside these hotspots and sometimes the opposite or mixed results happen you might stimulate wanting but actually suppress liking endocannabinoids have a hotspot that overlaps the opiate one in the nucleus accumbens it doubles liking reactions and more than doubles the food intake munchies the nucleus accumbens has a bunch of nerve cell bodies that project outwards to other areas of the brain , including the ventral pallidum vp the posterior half of the vp is another opiate hotspot that doubles liking and wanting they fire more vigorously in rats given sweet than unpleasantly very salty they will fire more vigorously in salt deprived rats when given reasonably salty taste inhibit gabaa in the vp anywhere and you stimulate wanting without changing liking at all in humans , cocaine , sex , food , and money reward all activate the vp hedonic hotspots are likely linked together into an integrated hierarchical circuit akin to multiple islands of an archipelago that trade together if you block one hotspot with an opiate blocker , the other one may be affected as well sometimes blocking one decreases liking , but increases wanting in the other the liking induced by benzos seems to need opiate help , as it is also blocked by opiate blockers may be why naltrexone , an opiate blocker , is useful for alcohol dependence and has been studied in overeating , cocaine , gambling , etc wanting and liking typically go hand in hand , but not always wanting means that we are motivated to do behaviors that will reward us with that which we seek , but in a neurosciencey kind of way rather than the poetic global word wanting if i want a ferrari , i might write down a plan and save some money and ultimately buy one , but in the addiction reward sense that is way too cognitive , cortical , and planned wanting in the addiction sense means a more immediate desire and can actually conflict with the larger picture of cognitive wanting for example , you might want your liver to be perfectly healthy and want to stop drinking , but you ca n't stop the immediate want for jim bean so you drink a quart every day in general , addicts like the stimulus they cannot stop wanting less and less as the addiction continues wanting is more globally distributed in the nervous system than liking while liking is mostly mediated by opiates , benzos , and endocannabinoids , wanting is also mediated by dopamine globally and dopamine interactions with glutamate on a micro level there are innate natural rewards such as sweet and learned rewards , and wanting for either can light up the limbic system crack cocaine addicts , for example , sometimes frantically chase ghosts or scrabble after white granules they know are not cocaine encounters with incentivizing stimuli for example a bar , or the sound of glasses clinking will increase the motivation to seek reward and increase the vigor with which they are sought there are also mirror neurons in the frontal cortex so that if you are watching someone drink a beer , some of these neurons will activate as if you are drinking the beer , so you experience it with the beer drinker desire stimulates action in some motor neurons as well , which is the generation of actual action in addition , fear and desire are intermingled dopamine and glutamate in the nucleus accumbens can stimulate desire and dread and certain regions seem to flip like switches to motivate opposite behaviors example , sitting in your comfortable home where you want to stay , then make the lights super bright and play very loud music so you want to leave stress hormones and repeatedly high doses of addictive drugs can stimulate near permanent sensitization of mesocorticolimbic dopamine related systens this will increase wanting and addictive behaviors continue despite a lack of associated liking the end ! fancy neurosience term for this reward immediate wanting is incentive salience
