ask the masked amhp for the answers to your thorny mha related problems he might know the answer or not a psychiatrist asks can someone detained under sec who is in need of medical treatment for physical reasons be transferred to a medical ward in a general hospital ? the masked amhp replies no para of the code of practice states unequivocally it is not possible for patients detained under section to be transferred to another hospital under section because they are not detained by virtue of an application made under part of the act it would be justifiable to admit them to a medical ward on the basis of urgent medical necessity , especially if the patient recognises they are in need of medical treatment , but it could not be done by the use of either transfer or sec leave another psychiatrist asks what constitutes a conflict of interest when conducting an assessment under the mha ? the masked amhp replies para of the code of practice states that a conflict of interest for professional reasons will occur where the assessor is in a line management or employment relationship with one of the other assessors or the patient or the nearest relative where the nearest relative is the applicant the assessor is a member of the same team as the patient or where there are three assessors , all of them are members of the same team it continues a line management relationship will exist whether an assessor manages , or is managed by , one of the other assessors , the patient or the nearest relative where the nearest relative is the applicant similarly an employment relationship will exist whether the assessor employs , or is employed by , one of the other assessors , the patient or the nearest relative where the nearest relative is the applicant for the purposes of the regulations a team is defined as a group of professionals who work together for clinical purposes on a routine basis that might include a community mental health team , a crisis resolution or home treatment team , or staff on an in patient unit but not necessarily the staff of an entire hospital to translate this into a typical scenario , where dr a and dr b assess a patient with amhp c if dr a supervises dr b , there would be a conflict of interest if dr a and dr b are of equal status and not supervised by the other , but they both work in the same community team as amhp c , then there would be a conflict of interest someone emails the masked amhp to ask is sec aftercare contained in the isle of man mental health act ? the masked amhp replies this is an interesting question many people will be unaware that the isle of man , which is an island in the irish sea about miles northwest of liverpool actually has its very own mental health act the isle of man is a british crown dependency it is miles long and miles wide , and has a population of around , people since it never became part of the kingdom of great britain , it has its own parliament and makes its own laws this includes a mental health act , which became law in much of the act mirrors the english mha , although the isle of man still has approved social workers it even has provision for aftercare under supervision it also has an equivalent to sec , which under the isle of man mha is contained in sec this section applies to persons who are a detained under section , b admitted to a hospital in pursuance of a hospital order made under section of the criminal jurisdiction act or paragraph of schedule a to the summary jurisdiction act , or c transferred to a hospital in pursuance of a transfer direction made under section or or a hospital direction , and then cease to be detained and whether or not immediately after so ceasing leave hospital it shall be the duty of the department , in co operation with the department of health and relevant voluntary agencies , to provide , or to make arrangements for the provision of , after care services for any person to whom this section applies until such time as the department is satisfied that the person concerned is no longer in need of such services but it shall not be so satisfied in the case of a patient who is subject to after care under supervision at any time while he remains so subject the isle of man mha also has its own code of practice chapter deals with aftercare although most of the chapter equates aftercare with the english care programme approach , does state section of the act requires the department in conjunction with voluntary agencies , to provide after care for certain categories of detained patients this includes patients given leave of absence under section the after care of detained patients should be detailed in the care plan but because of the specific statutory obligation it is important that all patients who are subject to section are identified and records kept of them there is a section after care entitlement when the patient stays in hospital informally after ceasing to be detained under the act , and also when a patient is released from prison , if they have spent part of their sentence detained in hospital i am afraid that i am unable to say whether or not aftercare under sec is chargeable perhaps an asw in the isle of man could enlighten me
