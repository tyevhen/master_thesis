today and tomorrow i want to talk about noise and how to describe it in prose , in case you reach a point in the writing of your novel or short story or essay or other piece of writing where you need to describe a noisy scene with some word or words other than noisy you can come at the problem of describing a noisy scene in various ways using a broad brush , you can apply words like noisy , cacophonous , and so on see below using a finer brush , you can particularize the noise , describing it as clangorous or sonorous or whatever see further below , perhaps even going as far as inventing a noise word to describe an actual instance of a sound , such as a huge cork coming out of an empty barrel with a shbunnkkk ! another thing you can do is devote word power to describing the effects of a noise , rather than concentrating on describing the actual noise e g , a car stereo with chest thumping hip hop describing the effect of a noise puts you a little further down the road of showing rather than telling but you can also bend imagery to your purpose something i 'll try to show in tomorrow 's post and try to reconstruct sounds using non sound words this takes a bit of ingenuity , but it can be well worth the headache let 's take a quick look at the vocabulary of noise in english noise words english words that can be used to indicate noise include babel , ballyhoo , bedlam , clamor , commotion , din , discord , fracas , hubbub , hullabalou , outcry , pandemonium , racket , ruckus , tumult , turmoil , uproar , vociferation characterizing noise the word noise is rather generic and thus vague because it can refer to so many kinds of sounds sometimes you want a word that can put more specificity on the noise consider the following words obstreperous unruly noisiness usually implies difficult to control cacophonous harsh sounding , grating clamorous marked by confused din or outcry clangorous noise characterized by clanging plangent loud , resounding , and often melancholy sonorous a sound that 's full , deep , rich stentorious or stentorian loud usually used in reference to a person 's voice , in honor of the herald , stentor , in homer 's iliad strident loud , harsh , grating stridulous implies a shrill creaking sound , as of floorboards being being torn up , a creaking door , or possibly the death gasp of some person or animal many insects have special adaptations that allow them to emit stridulatory sounds e g , crickets , grasshoppers words indirectly suggestive of noise words that can be used to suggest noise include unruly , riotous , rampageous , pandemonic these words imply chaotic behavior , rather than audible sound per se they can be bent through synesthesic metaphor to other semantic scopes for example , neon lights in riotous colors individual types of noises the list here is endless bang , boom , buzz , growl , hiss , jingle , pop , screech , squeal , tinkle , whimper , whine , yelp , etc all of these can serve either as verb or noun many sounds are associated with particular sources e g , the caterwaul of a cat i do n't know of a book that catalogs every conceivable type of noise although j i rodale 's synonym finder is a good place to start i'm sure there are hundreds of such words noises can be further characterized by auxiliary words adjectives that describe a sound 's unique characteristics e g the staccato clack clack clack of a stick along a picket fence with all these tools in your toolbag , you 'd think it would be easy or straightforward , at least to describe a noisy subway station , or crowd noise at a rally it 's actually harder than you might think , unless you simply want to say the crowd was noisy and be done with it tomorrow , i 'll show an example of how i handled a noisy bar restaurant scene in a piece of fiction i'm working on bring your ear plugs
