there are those who think i have taken an anti homosexual stance so let me clarify i have no stance about homosexuality i only try to follow the science and not shy away from facts that are politically incorrect that helps no one , especially those who want to change can we cure it ? wait ! is it an illness , a deviation that needs curing ? if you ask anyone whose defenses work and have always worked they would say , why would i need curing ? and since i am not in the priesthood most of all being jewish i don t have any desire to cure anyone of anything if they don t want and need it but i do want to help those who suffer some suffer from being gay and others are very comfortable with it why would i or anyone want to treat them ? i have no mission and never have had a mission to save the world i have found a way , to me the scientific way , to help those who hurt , who are anxious and depressed , who can t function and who are miserable we don t advertise and make outrageous claims about homosexuality or anything else we have cured some homosexuality we didn t start out to cure anything but two or three of them came to me after some time in therapy and said , my orientation has changed i said fine if it makes them happy so much the better what causes it ? that is a sticky wicket i have the feeling that with all the new research there is a hormonal base to some of it since traumas in the womb can and do change the later sex hormone levels that is not all there has to be a familial configuration that deprives the child of fulfillment of need , somehow , somewhere i do think heterosexuality is normal , given the need for survival of the species , to say nothing of how the parts fit together to make babies i really don t care if homosexuals think they are normal that is their choice i do not agree or disagree i try to follow my experience for over fifty years of therapy and of all the new research , including brain changes in homosexuals there seems to be general agreement in late research that traumas while in the womb can predispose to homosexuality this is certainly true in animals where females show mounting behavior yes , there are many animals who show homosexuality i am sure and do not dispute that but i am an expert in humans , not homosexuality i don t know who is i have no spin whatsoever about this anymore than i know that gestation and birth trauma lead to migraines later on if a migraine lobby tells me i am dead wrong , i can only indicate my experience over many decades with it and since we have cured many migrainers i will stick to my story incidentally , my new book manuscript cites many of the studies i mentioned above let s get off the posturing if i can help those with epilepsy , migraine and high blood pressure there must be something to the theory i do not know of any other psychotherapy that helps epilepsy nor deep depression that is because they cannot go deep enough to make profound changes what this means is that the causes and origins of many afflictions lie very deep in the brain therefore all therapies that use words to help people are talking to the wrong brain about being prejudiced members of my staff have been gay i engage those who are competent , period when i am in doubt about something i check with my homosexual friends when i want to know more about high blood pressure i check with my patients i do not have to be the repository of all wisdom
