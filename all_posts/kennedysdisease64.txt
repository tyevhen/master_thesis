i believe i mentioned in an earlier post that contributions for kennedy 's disease research were substantially lower this year we had hoped to fund more research grants , but actually had to dip into savings and operating reserves to fund the three top grants until the economy turns around and contributions improve , the kda , like everyone else , has to tighten its belt and scrutinize all expenditures today , i received word that the mda is also cutting expenses and reducing benefits because of reduced contributions below is an excerpt from the mda letter explaining their current financial situation we 're currently struggling with developing a balanced budget for , which means further expense reductions to date , we 've closed l field offices and retrenched positions we 're continuing the reduction of clinic grants by l , as well as reducing by second and third year funding for research grant renewals nonetheless , we now find ourselves needing to make the following cost adjustments in order to preserve to the greatest extent possible our most critical research and services initiatives accordingly , effective january , , mda will no longer o assist with the purchase of new durable medical equipment we 'll make every effort to meet equipment needs through our national equipment resource program formerly mda equipment loan closets o cover the cost of transportation to mda clinic appointments mda staff stands ready to assist with obtaining transportation to clinics through local resources new durable equipment includes braces , wheelchairs , communications devices , and other orthopedic equipment if you were planning to receive any support from the mda for any durable medical equipment , i would recommend that you contact your local or regional mda office immediately for additional information on what this cutback means to you what hurts even more is the reduction in new clinical grants and grant renewals supported by the mda researchers need the support of the kda and mda to help continue their research projects let us hope that the economy continues to move in a positive direction in
