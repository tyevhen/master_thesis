shockers the banner headline posted on the cover of the latest national enquirer at the supermarket check stand today was framed by pictures of famous women those who had and had not had plastic surgery on the left side of the cover were photos of katie couric , barbara eden and connie francis without make up , looking more or less their chronological ages , which ranged from for katie couric to seventy something for barbara eden and connie francis i looked at their pictures and what i saw were normal , attractive women in various stages of more or less natural aging why is that a shocker ? why are women famous and otherwise criticized or , worse , penalized for looking their age ? when i see my friends long time and new i see that they 're not young but i see the signs of lives well lived , of loving , of building character through the years i see kindness and sadness and joy i see a wealth of lifetime experiences in the faces of my friends i see that in my husband bob , too we met when i was and he i see the young bob as well as the older , wiser and more experienced bob when i look in his face i see the intelligence he has always had as well as the wisdom and compassion he has grown into through the years when i look in the mirror , i do see the extra weight , the wrinkles , the white hair i also see my mother 's face who thought i would ever grow to resemble my mother ? it 's a surprise but i am at peace with that i look at myself in the mirror and i see kindness both hers and mine and rejoice in the fact that i 've been given the gift of years to grow and become a better person than i was when my figure was lithe , my hair dark and abundant , my spirit strong , but largely untested by time what a gift it is to have a chance to grow older so many of my friends have not and yet , our youth oriented society epitomized by the the age porn of the national enquirer considers it a blunder , a shame , an indiscretion when a woman looks her age older men look distinguished while older women just look old the older i get , the less i care what others think i'm at ease with my own face , my own body and my own thoughts i think that growing older is a gift and i'm grateful for every day , every wrinkle , every new experience and every wise and treasured friend
