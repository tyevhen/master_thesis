i'm getting a little restless i'm waiting for my mouth to heal enough so i may resume running you 'd think this little day break would be nothing for me after all , i sat out months for my achilles i think that long break is making this little break feel more indeterminate than it actually is i'm anxious to get back to my training i 've had to be very quiet since my surgery any jostling to my mouth could slow or even stop the healing process i actually tried to run today , but i began to feel soreness at my surgery site so i stopped after one mile i went to the gym and rode an elliptical for awhile instead i do n't want to do anything that may jeopardize my mouth healing and healing well my mood has remained good throughout this little break i was concerned the surgical pain , the days off of work , the inability to run , and the extended downtime would negatively impact my mood , but so far so good i'm relieved relieved , but a bit restless i'm anxious to get back to training because my training for the new york city marathon has been going very well my achilles seems to be holding up well , and i'm feeling like a runner again i had great runs in the days before my surgery my second miler is scheduled for next sunday it 's all downhill until marathon day after that i 've purchased my plane ticket and reserved my hotel i'm ready to go yes , i'm ready to go now i just have to hurry up and heal
