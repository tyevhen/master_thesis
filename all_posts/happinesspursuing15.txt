yes , anonymous , i suppose i owe you an update i'm writing this later in the afternoon when i tend to be at my grumpiest so do take that into account i do n't have much to report since we last spoke , i 've had one pretty big life change one that 's greatly affecting my sleep schedule and one professional slap i do n't really feel like getting too much into either of these except to say that both are leaving me feeling rather down on myself and in general vague enough ? anyway , i only say that as something of a way of giving folic acid the benefit of a doubt i have n't noticed any improvement beyond what i described earlier and i find that i'm sleeping in again however , i have real life reasons to be a bit depressed , not just the usual unbalance perhaps i 'd be feeling worse than i do if it were n't for the supplement it 's impossible to say so , i'm down but only a little and certainly not out and , most importantly i suppose , i still have hope there 's your update we 'll see what time brings and , if you 're on the edge of you seat about the atheism thing , sorry i have n't done that yet as you can see , life has me a little distracted just now and since this is a largely non paying gig , i have to prioritize my keyboard time i 'll get to it
