the cdc commented that of those who had the flu shot this year will still get the flu yup , i had my flu shot and i still got the flu and , just as i always warned , those of us living with kennedy 's disease have to be extra careful when it comes to the flu it is day eleven and i feel between to well i still have the cough , but not quite as bad the fever and aches are gone day two and three were the worst just plain miserable i ended up sleeping most of the day between coughs anyway i have been extra cautious since coming down with it and very mindful of the seriousness of this health issue should it turn into pneumonia the weakness is still there , but i am improving every day i have exercised for to minutes the last five days and that seems to help as well as raise my spirits i have always said patience is a virtue it is also an attribute that i need to develop further having the flu this year has been a test for me i still highly recommend the flu shot and the pneumonia vaccine when you turn i still believe we have to be extra careful this time of year i was at the doctor s office once a week for eight weeks having my blood tested inr if i hadn t been exposing myself weekly i would probably have been safe the only real benefit to having the flu this time of year is all the college bowl games i never felt guilty sitting around and watching every game even though i often fell asleep halfway through some of them
