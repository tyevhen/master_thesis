hydrogen bonds dotted lines are only about as strong as covalent bonds solid lines last saturday , there was a fascinating discussion on twitter about the power of weak connections it was a real time tweetup held under the banner of ideachat , the latter being a monthly twitter chat focused on the process of ideation , held every second saturday of the month at a m est ideachat bills itself as a salon for twitter thinkers about ideas it is founded by angela dunn , idea designer and digital consultant , aka blogbrevity the discussion was loosely grounded in the work of mark s granovetter , whose paper the strength of weak ties american journal of sociology , may , pp is one of the most widely cited papers in sociology see also granovetter 's followup paper in sociological theory , the strength of weak ties a network theory revisited i wo n't try to recap the whole discussion here , since you can read the full transcript online elsewhere suffice it to say that in little more than an hour , people contributed tweets on the subject of how weak ties contribute to the spread of ideas in social networks the discussion seemed particularly apropos given that almost none of the discussants knew each other except through the casual , transient contact afforded by twitter and tweetchat the tool used by most participants in the discussion my main contribution to the discussion was to draw a parallel between weak social ties and the physical chemistry of hydrogen bonding i pointed out that in chemistry , weak links viz , hydrogen bonds are responsible for much of what makes biomolecule behavior interesting it 's a hard point to try to make in characters or less but it 's worth spending a minute thinking about in chemistry , there are several types of chemical bond the strongest type is the covalent bond this is the kind of bond that connects the various atoms in a molecule such as the hydrogens to the oxygen in water about as strong as the covalent bond is the hydrogen bond , which represents the weak electrostatic pull between electron rich atoms and electron poor atoms of different molecules about an order of magnitude weaker still is the van der waals force between atoms hydrogen bonds and van der waals interactions are transient in nature , whereas covalent bonds are for all intents permanent , or at least long lasting it turns out that a lot of interesting chemical behavior arises from the short lasting weak interactions that go under the name of hydrogen bonding the concept of surface tension arises from it protein folding happens the way it does because of hydrogen bonding the stickiness of adhesives is due to hydrogen bonding epoxy , on the other hand , owes its strength to covalent bonds at one point in the ideachat session , i asked rhetorically which is more useful , scotch tape or krazy glue ? someone later suggested a better analogy would have been duct tape , or even postit notes which famously rely on an adhesive that is almost but not quite ineffective you can do a lot of useful things with krazy glue which relies on covalent bonds to get the job done , but i can think of at least times more things you can do with duct tape tape is incredibly more versatile , even though the mechanism by which its adhesive works is fundamentally at least times weaker than the mechanism behind krazy glue in the same way , i tend to think that the weak ties engendered by things like twitter tend , in the aggregate , to produce effects that are surprisingly far reaching causing many tipping points to be reached long before they otherwise would be whether you agree with my physical chemistry analogies or not , i encourage you to take part in the next ideachat , which is scheduled to happen on the eleventh of december at a m eastern u s time mark your calendar i 'll see you there
