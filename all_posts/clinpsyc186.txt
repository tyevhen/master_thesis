in a report that slams the fda for lax oversight on clinical trials is tucked a gem regarding a psychiatrist named dr david linden last november , the oklahoma board of medical licensure and supervision suspended dr linden s license for three months because he had sex with two patients and gave them genital herpes infections , according to board records dr linden , who also owns a psychiatric center in las vegas , did not return repeated telephone messages wow ! he 's also run into trouble from the fda for poor conduct of trials giving herpes to patients was just icing on the cake the whole story is at the new york times on that note , have a good weekend in fact , i now officially proclaim the upcoming weekend as no sex with patients weekend i hope this is not too tabloid like for this site i do n't care about people 's personal misgivings we all have our flaws it 's when these errors in judgment start impacting patients that they really bother me i 've not seen the records indicating that dr linden engaged in such behavior , but i'm willing to trust the reporting of gardiner harris on this story
