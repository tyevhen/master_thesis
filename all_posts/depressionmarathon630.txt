things are continuing to go well i guess i could complain about my knee , which is still bothering me , but complaining is so useless besides , i had a great workout today if i were able to run as i wished , i would have done miles in preparation for my next marathon , which is now weeks away but miles was out of the question , so i decided to bike , run and swim instead i wanted to work out for three hours , which is approximately how long it would take me to run miles i began my morning in the pre dawn light on my bike as the sun rose , i biked a mile loop it was quite chilly when i began , but by the time i finished , the sun had warmed me nicely i jumped off my bike and ran miles my knee hurt , but it was tolerable it was too bad , for i felt like i could have kept running forever after my run , i drove a couple miles to my gym and got into the pool i swam one mile in total , i completed miles in just about three hours it was a great workout i had plenty of energy , and switching things up definitely kept me interested throughout the rest of my day has been filled with errands , chores , and of course , a nap i may go to a movie with friends tonight tomorrow i have to work pretty boring that 's the problem with feeling well i have less and less to say i worry about what to write here i do n't want to bore you i know some with depression have trouble relating when my life is so normal but this is my life with depression sometimes it hurts and sucks and sometimes , as is the case right now , i feel well so i apologize for having less to say , but i 'll keep writing about my boring life as long as you 'll have me thanks for listening
