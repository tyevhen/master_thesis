i had my annual checkup this last week my doctor commented he would never get rich off me because i only see him once a year the good news i am as healthy as a horse the bad news i just can t run like one cpk is good my cpk is up slightly this year , but is still much better than the days where it ran , this is positive news since i increased the number of reps and length of my exercise program last year it appears it is not doing any harm i had a complete blood workup everything looks good including my hdl , ldl and cholesterol as well as my blood pressure and pulse we discussed my neuropathy in my lower legs and feet my doctor commented that when i was ready , we could discuss possible treatments that might help dutasteride and , based upon the results over the last eleven months , i will continue taking dutasteride this year in reviewing my current condition versus last year , it appears i am the same or better except for the occasional neck weakness i have encountered this year not bad for a guy years old who is going to be a great grandpa any day now
