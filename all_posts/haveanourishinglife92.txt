if you are like me , you won t always have the opportunity to eat the healthiest or the cleanest , as they say sometimes , you just have to make do with what you have ideally , we d all have organic and natural foods to eat on a daily basis but , that s just not realistic we don t live in a perfect world sometimes , you can t be picky you just have to eat maybe it is not what you want to eat , or when you want to eat , or how you want to eat sometimes eating is just downright dirty like when you 're on a road trip , or away from home , or when your cupboards are almost bare because you need to go to the store but , it s one of those things , you know , that you have to do everyone has to eat to stay alive however , when you sacrifice perfection if you ca n't eat perfect food , you don t end up with nothing in my opinion , eating is better than choosing not to eat it 's good to not be so rigid with your eating standards for me , this means being ok with it when my grandpa offers me a coke , or when my grandma offers me a chocolate chip cookie this means being ok when i am celebrating with my friends and family , or when i am at a restaurant every meal cannot be a perfect example of eating nutritiously and intuitively when i first started practicing intuitive eating , it was important to stay focused for a length of time to try to make the experience of eating a pleasant one , a successful one , and a nutritious one but when i got the hang of it , i realized it is also good to cut yourself some slack it s ok if you eat too much from time to time and conversely , it s ok if you eat too little from time to time it s ok if every meal is not the best ever balanced with fruits , veggies , proteins , and fats it s ok , occasionally , to get distracted and eat the entire bowl of popcorn during a movie every once in a while it s ok to enjoy second helpings of dessert even if you aren t hungry anymore life goes on life is too important to spend every waking moment worrying and deciphering what , how , and when to eat if you liked this article , check out these posts how to stop binge eating one way to stop emotional overeating just when i think i am done hiking , i have to climb another mountain
