the way we think has a powerful impact on our day to day lives over the next couple of weeks , i will be looking at alternative thought patterns to inject a little positivity into your lives , and help achieve your goals last week i talked about not being alone and having a cheerleading squad to help you you can read that post here believe in yourself self doubt is a huge problem for many women , myself included as soon as you begin to achieve or follow a life long dream , that little voice inside your head speaks up normally it says something like you re not good enough , or everyone will laugh at you when we hear it we have two options we can give in , listen to it and hide away , or we can believe in ourselves as susan jeffers would say , feel the fear and do it anyway believing in ourselves doesn t mean we are better than anyone else it can feel like we are on an ego trip if we say how proud we are of something we ve achieved i have some friends on facebook and twitter , who run highly successful business and homes , and they tell the world about it not only does this cement their belief in their abilities and business savvy , but it encourages others to follow their lead and make necessary changes i believe in myself is just the same as saying , i m worth it it s important to accept who you are , warts and all so that you can start to believe in yourself after my divorce , i spent many years getting to know who i was not as a wife , mother or daughter , but as me what i discovered surprised me i was good company it took me a long time to stop putting everyone else first a trait that every mother will understand , but it was vital to my self confidence and personal development i took the time to look after myself , physically , mentally and emotionally , and became a better parent and person for it when you feel good about yourself and your life , you re more likely to attract success and opportunities to your door as a writer , the self doubt monster slashes its razor sharp talons quite often in my direction i finish a project and re read my work with horror granted , some times this horror is warranted , and i need to chuck it all in the bin and start from scratch other times , it s just fear that rises and tries to thwart my attempts at making a living from what i love doing when i wrote how i changed my life in a year , i was terrified i managed to hold onto the belief in myself as i was writing and editing it , but once it went live , i was a mess of nerves how do you combat those feelings ? i don t think i ever did or have , got rid of them i ve just learnt to understand them i had produced something i was extremely proud of i d taught my children that if you put your mind to something , it can be accomplished i began to believe that what i d produced would help women similar to myself i was rewarded for my belief by hundreds of emails and messages via social media , telling me how much people resonated with my tale the incredible stories i heard from my readers all centered around a new found belief in themselves , and i d helped them to feel it it was a proud moment remember to invest in yourself look after you first , whether that s related to your health , wellbeing or lifestyle adopt a new mantra , and tell yourself every day , i m worth it ! i believe in you
