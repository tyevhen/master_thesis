when science , industry , and government collide , the results are often less than pretty aubrey blumsohn gives a glance into several episodes , all of which apparently related to the date october in various years either october is a very bad day , or these incidents occur with regularity on many other days of the year as well i strongly suggest nay , i insist , that you educate yourselves over at the scientific misconduct blog when done , feel free to head over to furious seasons and get a reminder about how the patient advocate group known as the national alliance for the mentally ill touted the second generation antipsychotics as life saving that 's all fine and dandy , until one notes there is no data that schizophrenia outcomes have improved by a single iota since these drugs were foisted upon the public but do n't worry , these miracle antipsychotic drugs are now prescribed for bipolar disorder , mega watered down bipolar disorder , autism , depression , and whatever else you can imagine so , the gap in lifespan between people with schizophrenia and the rest of us continues to increase , yet these drugs are still pimped as a huge improvement over older treatments my guaranteed prediction and when the next bandwagon of psychiatric treatments comes out , count on them to be touted as safer and more effective than the drugs that they are replacing the same companies that are currently pushing atypical antipsychotics will eventually push other antipsychotic drugs and will then denigrate the very same treatments they now claim are life saving nami and others that claim to advocate for patients will state uequivocally that the new treatments save lives and make the world a better place the old treatments may even be labeled as causing dependence , which of course will not be true of the newer treatments of course , at the anemic rate which psychiatric drugs are being developed these days , it may be a few years before the prior paragraph comes true , but come true it will mark my words i have no special powers of prediction all one needs to do is notice a pattern and note that there are currently no real obstacles beside having very few drugs in the pipleine to the current script being replayed over and over again if you think the media or a clinical trial registry are going to fix things , consider yourself a sunny optimist
