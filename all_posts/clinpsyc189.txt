it appears that lindsay devane , who called his own continuing medical education article appearing in cns spectrums a commercial piece of crap has retracted his story via the excellent carlat psychiatry blog apparently , his take on the former crap piece has now changed to there should be no question about the integrity of the cns spectrums publication as a cme activity the article went from , in his own words , a ridiculous text to an article that reflects the inherent limitations in providing practicing clinicians with fundamental descriptions of complicated issues is he implying that practicing clinicians lack the intellectual fortitude to understand complicated issues , so he had to dumb it down to meet their limited capacity ? perhaps there is another interpretation he also changed his tune to all three co authors were heavily involved in multiple edits before agreement was reached on a final manuscript from stating originally that he had not actually read the manuscript that is quite a change indeed one can only wonder which individuals pressed devane to change his story here 's what i do n't understand devane has been in the game for a long time does he really have that much to lose by pointing out the joke that it today 's continuing medical education system ? i want to know who spoke with him and how he was persuaded to change his mind this is such a ridiculous turnaround in stories that it makes larry craig look like a straight shooter i am doubtful that devane would have changed his story without significant influence from others drs charles nemeroff and sheldon preskorn were the coauthors i ca n't help but wonder if one or both of them took exception to devane 's labeling of the piece as crap and read him the riot act does devane not realize that this turnaround in story is farcical ? read the full story here two further glittering examples of continuing medical education in psychiatry gone awry can be read here and here to see another key opinion leader contradict himself , go here
