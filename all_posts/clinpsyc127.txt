as reported on pharmalot and furious seasons , the antiepileptic mood stabilizer class of drugs has been stuck with a suicide warning by the fda granted , the fda was n't exactly quick to come to their conclusion these drugs have been on the market for quite some time , but better late than never others have noted similar concerns prior to the fda 's interest in the topic hey , does this remind anyone else of the ssri suicide story , , , , , , , ? but wait a minute , are n't these supposed to be life saving medications ? wait , i can hear it coming now drug wonks and others with similar views will be complaining that because the fda is irresponsibly fearmongering , people will stop taking their life saving medications and masses of suicide will ensue
