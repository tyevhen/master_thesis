this has been a particularly long , tough week mentally and physically , things are n't going well my lungs still are n't cleared up enough to allow me to run i 've been compensating with a bit of weight lifting and some long walks with jet , but that 's about it that 's been tough on my mood my mood has been as complicated as my lungs i 've been so , so low , that my md increased one of my medications unfortunately , it appears that increase has caused akathisia , which is this unrelenting restlessness where you feel like you are crawling out of your skin all the time it 's very uncomfortable so what to do ? well , we decreased the offending med slightly , which ironically had begun to improve my mood , in order to get rid of the nasty akathisia , but that puts me at risk of another decline in my mood the fun never ends the combination of poor physical health combined with poor mental health , and now anxiety , has really taken a toll on my ability to work i 've managed very few hours over the past week i made it in to work today , but my anxiety akathisia was so intense , i could barely breathe , much less think , and i left after only minutes i spent the rest of the day paralyzed on the sofa , restless , feeling like i needed to move , yet unable to do so it 's been a long day i'm supposed to work tomorrow , and i'm very concerned about that mornings have been exceptionally tough to get going once i get to work , i'm usually okay today was the exception but getting my heavy , low mood out the door has been a challenge hopefully tomorrow will begin a little brighter i'm also feeling more and more pressure to get back to training i 've missed a miler and one whole week of training , right in the middle of my marathon training program this is not a recipe for success i'm hoping to get back out on the road this weekend , probably sunday , and hoping i can manage more than just a few miles , too the chicago marathon is only a five weeks away the bottom line , however , is i am exhausted and frustrated with the current state of things , mentally and physically i feel like a yo yo one day things are improving , the next i have a brand new debilitating symptom one day i feel some energy and hope , the next day i ca n't force my body to move today , i wanted to curl up and disappear i'm tired stability , i hope , has to return soon
