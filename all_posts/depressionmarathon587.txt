a one ton gorilla sits atop my chest it is depression i am pinned suffocating there is no chance of getting up a one ton gorilla sits atop my chest i ca n't breathe my thoughts race looking for a way out but the gorilla will not let go i squirm with might i wiggle and flail past successes matter not this time the gorilla is not phased i know not what else to do my tool box is empty from my precarious perch i scheme with friends i consult with professionals i summon the best , and they surround me with care but the gorilla , he is not moved a one ton gorilla sits atop my chest oblivious , he is , at my attempts to remove him hopelessly suffocating , i fear for my life i no longer know how to escape this gorilla , it seems , will never be moved
