this is a long article but important new efficiencies take huge toll on psychiatry by gardiner harris new york times news service doylestown , pa alone with his psychiatrist , the patient confided that his newborn had serious health problems , his distraught wife was screaming at him and he had started drinking dr matthew levin , son of dr donald levin , is completing training to be a psychiatrist the elder dr levin said he hoped his son would not feel his ambivalence about their profession but the psychiatrist , dr donald levin , stopped him and said hold it i m not your therapist i could adjust your medications , but i don t think that s appropriate like many of the nation s , psychiatrists , dr levin , in large part because of changes in how much insurance will pay , no longer provides talk therapy , the form of psychiatry popularized by sigmund frued that dominated the profession for decades instead , he prescribes medication , usually after a brief consultation with each patient so dr levin sent the man away with a referral to a less costly therapist and a personal crisis unexplored and unresolved medicine is rapidly changing in the united states from a cottage industry to one dominated by large hospital groups and corporations , but the new efficiencies can be accompanied by a telling loss of intimacy between doctors and patients and no specialty has suffered this loss more profoundly than psychiatry trained as a traditional psychiatrist at michael reese hospital , a sprawling chicago medical center that has since closed , dr levin , , first established a private practice in , when talk therapy was in its heyday then , like many psychiatrists , he treated to patients in once or twice weekly talk therapy sessions of minutes each now , like many of his peers , he treats , people in mostly minute visits for prescription adjustments that are sometimes months apart then , he knew his patients inner lives better than he knew his wife s now , he often cannot remember their names then , his goal was to help his patients become happy and fulfilled now , it is just to keep them functional dr levin has found the transition difficult he now resists helping patients to manage their lives better i had to train myself not to get too interested in their problems , he said , and not to get sidetracked trying to be a semi therapist brief consultations have become common in psychiatry , said dr steven s sharfstein , a former president of the american psychiatric associationand the president and chief executive of sheppard pratt health system , maryland s largest behavioral health system it s a practice that s very reminiscent of primary care , dr sharfstein said they check up on people they pull out the prescription pad they order tests with thinning hair , a gray beard and rimless glasses , dr levin looks every bit the psychiatrist pictured for decades in new yorker cartoons his office , just above dog daze canine hair designs in this suburb of philadelphia , has matching leather chairs , and african masks and a moose head on the wall but there is no couch or daybed dr levin has neither the time nor the space for patients to lie down anymore on a recent day , a year old man visited dr levin to get his prescriptions renewed , an encounter that took about minutes two years ago , the man developed rheumatoid arthritis and became severely depressed hi family doctor prescribed an antidepressant , to no effect he went on medical leave from his job at an insurance company , withdrew to his basement and rarely ventured out i became like a bear hibernating , he said missing the intrigue he looked for a psychiatrist who would provide talk therapy , write prescriptions if needed and accept his insurance he found none he settled on dr levin , who persuaded him to get talk therapy from a psychologist and spent months adjusting a mix of medications that now includes different antidepressants and an antipsychotic the man eventually returned to work and now goes out to movies and friends houses the man s recovery has been gratifying for dr levin , but the brevity of his appointments like those of all of his patients leaves him unfulfilled i miss the mystery and intrigue of psychotherapy , he said now i feel like a good volkswagen mechanic i m good at it , dr levin went on , but there s not a lot to master in medications it s like a space odyssey , where you had hal the supercomputer juxtaposed with the ape with the bone i feel like i m the ape with the bone now the switch from talk therapy to medications has swept psychiatric practices and hospitals leaving many older psychiatrists feeling unhappy and inadequate a government survey found that just percent of psychiatrists provided talk therapy to all patients , a share that had been falling for years and has most likely fallen more since psychiatric hospitals that once offered patients months of talk therapy now discharge them within days with only pills recent studies suggest that talk therapy may be as good as or better than drugs in the treatment of depression , but fewer than half of depressed patients now get such therapy compared with the vast majority years ago insurance company reimbursement rates and policies that discourage talk therapy are part of the reason a psychiatrist can earn for three minute medication visits compared with for a minute talk therapy session competition from psychologists and social workers who unlike psychiatrists do not attend medical school , so they can often afford to charge less is the reason that talk therapy is priced at a lower rate there is no evidence that psychiatrists provide higher quality talk therapy than psychologists or social workers of course , there are thousands of psychiatrists who still offer talk therapy to all their patients , but they care mostly for the worried wealthy who pay in cash in new york city , for instance , a select group of psychiatrists charge or more per hour to treat investment bankers , and top child psychiatrists charge , and more for initial evaluations when he started in psychiatry , dr levin kept his own schedule in a spiral notebook and paid college students to spend four hours a month sending out bills but in , he started a series of jobs in hospitals and did not return to full time private practice until , when he and more than a dozen other psychiatrists with whom he had worked were shocked to learn that insurers would no longer pay what they had planned to charge for talk therapy at first , all of us held steadfast , saying we spent years learning the craft of psychotherapy and weren t relinquishing it because of parsimonious policies by managed care , dr levin said but one by one , we accepted that that craft was no longer economically viable most of us had kids in college and to have your income reduced that dramatically was a shock to all of us it took me at least five years to emotionally accept that i was never going back to doing what i did before and what i loved he could have accepted less money and could have provided time to patients even when insurers did not pay , but , he said , i want to retire with the lifestyle that my wife and i have been living for the last years nobody wants to go backwards , moneywise , in their career , he said would you ? dr levin would not reveal his income in , the median compensation for psychiatrists was about , , according to surveys by a medical trade group to maintain their incomes , physicians often respond to fees cut by increasing the volume of services they provide , but psychiatrists rarely earn enough to compensate for their additional training most would have been better off financially choosing other medical specialties dr louisa lance , a former colleague of dr levin s , practices the old style of psychiatry from an office next to her house , miles from dr levin s office she sees new patients for minutes and schedules follow up appointments for minutes everyone gets talk therapy cutting ties with insurers was frightening since it meant relying solely on word of mouth , rather than referrals within insurers networks , dr lance said , but she cannot imagine seeing patients for just minutes she charges for most appointments and treats fewer patients in a week than dr levin treats in a day medication is important , she said , but it s the relationship that gets people better dr levin s initial efforts to get insurers to reimburse him and persuade his clients to make their co payments were less than successful his office assistants were so sympathetic to his tearful patients that they often failed to collect so in , he begged his wife , laura levin a licensed talk therapist herself , as a social worker to take over the business end of the practice ms levin created accounting systems , bought two powerful computers , licensed a computer scheduling program from a nearby hospital and hired independent contractors to haggle with insurers and call patients to remind them of appointments she imposed a variety of fees on patients for a missed appointment , for a faxed prescription refill and extra for a missed co payment as soon as a patient arrives , ms levin asks firmly for a co payment , which can be as much as she schedules follow up appointments without asking for preferred times or dates because she does not want to spend precious minutes as patients search their calendars if patients say they cannot make the appointments she scheduled , ms levin changes them this is about volume , she said , and if we spend two minutes extra or five minutes extra with every one of patients a day , that means we re here two hours longer every day and we just can t do it she said that she would like to be more giving of herself , particularly to patients who are clearly troubled but she has disciplined herself to confine her interactions to the business at hand the reality is that i m not the therapist anymore , she said , words that echoed her husband s drawing the line ms levin , , maintains a lengthy waiting list , and many of the requests are heartbreaking on a january day , a pregnant mother of a year old called to say that her husband was so depressed he could not rouse himself from bed could he have an immediate appointment ? dr levin s first opening was a month away i get a call like that every day , and i find it really distressing , ms levin said but do we work hours every day instead of ? at some point , you have to make a choice initial consultations are minutes , while second and later visits are in those first minutes , dr levin takes extensive medical , psychiatric and family histories he was trained to allow patients to tell their stories in their own unhurried way with few interruptions , but now he asks a rapid fire series of questions in something akin to a directed interview even so , patients sometimes fail to tell him their most important symptoms until the end of the allotted time there was a guy who came in today , a year old man with a series of business failures who thinks he has a d d , or attention deficit disorder dr levin said so i go through the whole thing and ask a series of questions about a d d , and it s not until the very end when he says , on oct , i thought life was so bad , i was thinking about killing myself with that , dr levin began to consider an entirely different diagnosis from the man s pattern of symptoms excessive worry , irritability , difficulty falling asleep , muscle tension in his back and shoulders , persistent financial woes , the early death of his father , the disorganization of his mother the thread that runs throughout this guy s life is anxiety , not a d d although anxiety can impair concentration , said dr levin , who prescribed an antidepressant that he hoped would moderate the man s anxiety and he pressed the patient to see a therapist , advice patients frequently ignore the visit took minutes , putting dr levin behind schedule in minute consultations , dr levin asks for quick updates on sleep , mood , energy , concentration , appetite , irritability and problems like sexual dysfunction that can result from psychotropic medications and people want to tell me about what s going on in their lives as far as stress , dr levin said , and i m forced to keep saying i m not your therapist i m not here to help you figure out how to get along with your boss , what you do that s self defeating , and what alternative choices you have dr levin , wearing no iron khakis , a button down blue shirt with no tie , blue blazer and loafers , had a cheery greeting for his morning patients before ushering them into his office emerging minutes later after each session , he would walk into ms levin s adjoining office to pick up the next chart , announce the name of the patient in the waiting room and usher that person into his office he paused at noon to spend minutes eating an asian chicken salad with ramen noodles he got halfway through the salad when an urgent call from a patient made him put down his fork , one of about such calls he gets every day by afternoon , he had dispensed with the cheery greetings at p m , his waiting room empty , dr levin heaved a sigh after emerging from his office with his th patient then the bell on his entry door tinkled again , and another patient came up the stairs oh , i thought i was done , dr levin said , disappointed ms levin handed him the last patient s chart quick decisions the levins said they did not know how long they could work hour days and if the stock market hadn t gone down two years ago , we probably wouldn t be working this hard now , ms levin said dr levin said that the quality of treatment he offers was poorer than when he was younger for instance , he was trained to adopt an unhurried analytic calm during treatment sessions but my office is like a bus station now , he said how can i have an analytic calm ? and years ago , he often saw patients or more times before arriving at a diagnosis now , he makes that decision in the first minute visit you have to have a diagnosis to get paid , he said with a shrug i play the game in interviews , six of dr levin s patients their identities , like those of the other patients , are being withheld to protect their privacy said they liked him despite the brief visits i don t need a half hour or an hour to talk , said a stone mason who has panic attacks and depression and is prescribed an antidepressant just give me some medication , and that s it i m o k another patient , a licensed therapist who has post partum depression worsened by several miscarriages , said she sees dr levin every four weeks , which is as often as her insurer will pay for the visits dr levin has prescribed antidepressants as well as drugs to combat anxiety she also sees a therapist , and it s really , really been helping me , especially with my anxiety , she said she said she likes dr levin and feels that he listens to her dr levin expressed some astonishment that his patients admire him as much as they do the sad thing is that i m very important to them , but i barely know them , he said i feel shame about that , but that s probably because i was trained in a different era the levins s youngest son , matthew , is now training to be a psychiatrist , and dr donald levin said he hoped that his son would not feel his ambivalence about their profession since he will not have experienced an era when psychiatrists lavished time on every patient before the s , many psychiatrists were stuck in asylums treating confined patients covered in filth , so most of the th century was unusually good for the profession in a telephone interview from the uc irvine where he is completing the last of his training to become a child and adolescent psychiatrist , dr matthew levin said , i m concerned that i may be put in a position where i d be forced to sacrifice patient care to make a living , and i m hoping to avoid that
