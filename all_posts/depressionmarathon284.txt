i'm still frustrated and angry about the current state of affairs my mood is not good i'm still having trouble moving my body i'm still heavy and slow i'm sleeping more hours than i'm awake , no matter how hard i try to stay awake i'm exhausted and i'm feeling worthless , isolated and alone my thoughts are about the only things that are moving quickly right now , and they 're providing no relief i'm being bombarded by negative thinking i'm being heckled by my worthless brain i'm being trashed by thoughts about my character , my illness , what i should be doing , etc it 's no fun on top of all that joy , i developed some sort of virus today sore throat , headache , body aches the whole ball of wax i had to stay home from work even though it has been difficult getting through the days at work , it has at least been a healthy distraction today was a really long day of feeling like crap mentally and physically i'm hoping this virus is short lived , as i'm supposed to spend the weekend with d at the lake i 'll figure out tomorrow whether that 's going to happen or not i'm also scheduled to run a miler this saturday i was able to run a bit yesterday , but today was impossible for all of the above , obvious reasons i hope things improve for saturday it sure would be nice to feel like a runner again come to think of it , it sure would be nice to feel human again
