it 's amazing just how much anxiety can transform your life for many , this condition can make normally mundane tasks , such as reading , eating , driving , walking , and so on , excruciatingly difficult consequentially , sometimes i look at those without this condition with jealousy their lives seem so much easier than mine of course , the targets of my envy could have their own mental health problems or other life complications yet when i'm really anxious and i see people casually doing activities that drive me crazy , i ca n't help but envy their freedom from the managed hell i experience every day
