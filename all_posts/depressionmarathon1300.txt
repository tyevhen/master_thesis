i'm feeling uneasy today as i keep working to get my message out into the wider web , i have been honored to be added to a few blogrolls today , i noticed my addition to a space where the taking of meds is , it appears , frowned upon this is not a position i agree with , hence my uneasiness first , let me clarify i have no problem with any person treating any illness in any way they wish holistic , medications , magnets , prayers as long as that decision is made with a sound mind and in consultation with a medical professional we all have the right to control what we put into and do with our bodies what makes me uncomfortable , and sometimes downright angry tom cruise is when those who have made a decision i e not to take meds purport to know that their decision is the right choice for everyone regardless of the issue , i dislike when anyone scribbles in a chat room , blabs on television , or writes an article condemning the opposite option as if it was the devil reincarnate ! unfortunately , the anonymity of the internet seems to heighten this arrogance the feelings about taking meds for mental illness are strong the arguments against taking meds appear to run passionate and deep everyone is entitled to their opinion , but i guess i just do n't get it if there were no psychiatric meds , i would be dead or worse , i would be living an incredibly debilitating , miserable , isolated life without value or meaning it would be suicide , literally , for me to disavow psychiatric meds i may choose not to take a cold medication i am pretty health conscious , and i know a cold will eventually run its course but if i had a life threatening brain tumor , i would n't think twice about intravenously running poison through my bloodstream , at great risk to my immediate quality of life , in order to shrink that tumor and possibly save my life ! in my opinion , a non medical stranger discouraging someone from treating his mental illness with medication , is no less ridiculous than encouraging him to allow that brain tumor to grow ! i have a life threatening illness ! it happens to be called depression , perhaps a less scary term than tumor , but the illness should be taken no less seriously this illness has nearly claimed my life more than once why would n't i treat it with everything at my disposal ? nutrition , exercise , sleep , sobriety , therapy , supportive relationships , volunteering , working , and medication ! without my medication , i cannot pull off the rest of my treatment plan my illness wo n't allow it i have little hope of working , running , sleeping , eating , or relating to others if my basic , biological condition is not treated with the medication that was created to treat it that brings up another point i do n't get we give billions of dollars and accolades to the brilliant chemists who research and formulate medications for all of those other deadly illnesses cancer , heart disease , ed ha ! , diabetes heroes are the companies who develop these meds but , when it comes to mental illness , research dollars lag behind , and the drug companies are demonized according to the hyperbole in some of the books , magazines , and websites available , you 'd think that the drug companies were actually attempting to harm us rather than ease our distress yes , drugs are big business ! all drugs are business , not just drugs for mental illness most drugs have side effects , not just the ones for depression , schizophrenia , etc many drugs are very expensive , not just ours and without the development of new , cutting edge , expensive medications , many of us have relatives , friends , or co workers who would have died long ago from an illness for which there was previously no cure we also must realize the cancer , diabetes , and erectile dysfunction drugs are much more profitable and better for company pr than are the poorly compensated , stigmatized , and often vilified medications for mental illness yet , some in the non med camp make it sound as if the drug companies and my psychiatrist are in a worldwide conspiracy to increase my suffering by medicating me huh ? ? we have to quit playing the victim choosing whether or not to take psychiatric medication is a personal decision , preferably made in consultation with one 's doctor once made , however , we need to take responsibility for our choice instead , it appears there is a need to justify the choice not to take meds by blaming the idiot doctor , condemning the money grubbing drug companies , claiming that med use is not biblical or godly , or the list goes on because meds are n't appropriate for one person , or are against an other 's beliefs , does not mean we should run around encouraging everyone with mental illness to throw out their meds i shudder to think of how many teenagers saw tom cruise 's rant on oprah , stopped taking meds or seeking treatment because of his beliefs , and are no longer alive to tell us about it mr cruise , if you get depression , you can choose not to take meds , just as i choose to no longer support your career i have a life threatening illness i choose to take medication as one piece of my treatment plan my illness , when not treated with medication , vacates my soul , chokes my voice , and snuffs out my life that 's my experience so i take my medications faithfully , not because i am weak , nor spiritual enough , nor addicted to their effects i love that one ! i take them because without them , my illness would control a debilitated , worthless life rather than me controlling a cruel illness and creating a worthwhile life for me , it 's a no brainer
