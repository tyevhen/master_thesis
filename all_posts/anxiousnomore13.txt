i am sharing a really great story that was originally blogged at the brave girls club anxiety has really made me more compassionate towards others suffering with their own trials this story is such a great way to look at things , i love it enjoy ! after a dear friend telling me about a hurtful experience she d had this week i began thinking again about a story i have told a few times a story that my children will tell to their children , and maybe even beyond that because it was such a learning experience in our family maybe even a turning point it s a story that i think about often because we were the main characters in it or years ago , and even though it was something that lasted less than minutes it changed all of us and now i see others differently , especially when it seems that they might be main characters in the same story or one a lot like it i used to be too embarrassed to tell this story but i am not anymore this is a human story that everyone needs to hear , i truly believe this i hope you will stay with it , it s kinda long as we move along i want you to think about some of the big signs with big messages that i bet you wish you could wear around your neck sometimes so that people would be more gentle or even that you could put around the neck of someone you love so that you didn t have to go into a big long story to defend yourself or someone else so that people would just stop judging and and just be kind first , if you don t know my history because you are brand new to brave girls club welcome welcome welcome ! i need to start this story by giving you a little bit of background you see , my husband had an accident in that injured the frontal lobe of his brain it has taken years to get him back but in the middle there , between and now lots and lots of stuff happened he was essentially out of it but not just that he changed to someone else , we lost him his personality changed completely , he could not work , he was angry and depressed and could not cope with human beings he did not feel love or affection , really he only felt anger rage and he was suicidal most of the time he did not remember a lot of things he could not take care of our family or even himself , really and i want to mention again that through lots of miracles , he is recovered now we are so thankful he is even better than he was before his accident but during that time he would have these confusing and amazing glitches of time when he would be totally normal it was bittersweet they would last for an hour sometimes , and sometimes for days or even weeks then he would sink back down into that horrible place when he was sick , i protected him fiercely i didn t want anyone to see him like that i had faith that someday he would recover but man oh man it was lonely i wished every single day that i could just walk around with a sign like this because on the outside i looked like i had everything going for me i looked like i might just have a perfect life but i was hiding a very painful secret well a lot of other things happened too you can imagine what might happen over the years while we have a acre farm , a pretty big international business that we own with lots of employees a life that he managed before his accident , while he just let me do the fun and creative stuff now we had lots of medical bills lots of sorrow and lots of distractions we also had lots of kids and no one competent managing the business well after a few years , i couldn t hold it all together our business was suffering for all of the reasons listed above and a few more reasons on top of that and we discovered that we were really sinking well one day when he was partly lucid he was there he was coherent i told him the condition of our life he kind of panicked and he went straight to work figuring out what he could do it was insanely heartbreaking when he would wake up after weeks or months and i had to tell him how much things were deteriorating financially , etc it was very hard but when he could , he did what he could before his mental illness sucked him back into the prison it kept him in most of the time he called a sign place and had a huge sign brought out to our house the kind that you can put letters on , and it was electric and lit up he put it by the road in one of our horse fields then he drove our suburban both of our trucks my classic thunderbird that he got me for my birthday a few years earlier our tractor all of our tractor implements the boat that i worked years to get for him and that caused his brain injury , incidentally and he lined everything up along the fence and he put a price tag on every single thing then , he put the letters on that big huge sign and plugged it in you have to understand that we had worked for many years for those things we started a business in our twenties and we sacrificed everything we had for all of those years to make it work we owned almost all of it outright but , when i told him that the business was struggling this is what he did sooooo there it was all in a row all of our stuff out in our field all of the neighbors driving by our friends the community people who knew us most of our lives and people who knew nothing about us we were just the young family who lived in that beautiful little farm house on beacon light road with the perfect lawn or what used to be you see , in addition for months our once beautifully manicured yard started to be filled with weeds that were now several feet high i just couldn t keep it up the lawn was a nightmare everything was just falling apart all around me and my heart was broken over my husband , too it was humiliating and exhausting and horrible , really well , the sign was not up in the field for more than a few hours when my husband s phone rang it was someone who saw all the stuff and my husband s phone number on the big huge sign we were sitting out in the yard while he was still coherent and he was feeling devastated about the condition of our lawn i was apologizing that i just couldn t do all of it he was so heartbroken at his limitations and that he had left me to try to handle our life alone we were trying to make a plan he answered his phone i saw that he was just listening i could hear that the person s voice was getting louder and louder and louder my husband just listened he turned his back to me a little so i wouldn t hear but i could hear it it seemed to go on and on and on these were the things i could hear on the other end of the phonecall you are bringing down the value of my property with that ugly sign ! what are you doing ? that is the most obnoxious sign , do you have a permit to have that out there ? are you starting a used car lot ? you have got to get all of that moved and out of here or i am calling the authorities i sat there , mortified , embarrassed , humiliated , mad , sad , devastated i was certain that this would snap my husband back into his dark hellish place but , when the man was done ranting , my husband waited a second and then very calmly said something that i will never , ever forget sir , he said , there was a time in this country , in this community when if you drove past your neighbor s house and saw every single thing they own was for sale in front of their house and that their lawn had not been mowed for weeks that you would stop and say what is going on , something must be terribly wrong , what can i do to help you ? the man was silent and then my husband went on to tell him a few details about what was going on with our family the man waited a moment and then his tone changed he apologized i mean , really apologized and then said i am going to call all of my friends and see if any of them need any of this stuff i wish with everything in me that we could have put a sign up on that big stupid lit up billboard in our field that said our life is falling apart but all that we really could put up is a sign with the price of everything that we owned that was worth any money what if we could all wear a sign that said what we really meant ? what if we could go straight past the small talk or the masks and we could actually go straight to the heart of the matter what if our friends and family wore signs like this ? we would treat each other differently i think we should just try to imagine it that when a friend is quiet or not showing up to stuff she usually shows up to or acting a little off or a family member is wearing pajamas to the grocery store for weeks on end or not answering the phone or the lawn is not mowed whatever it is it is a sign it is not a sign that can be read in words and letters , but it is a sign that someone needs to be treated gently that they need help most of all , that they need love , understanding and that they definitely do not need to be judged every time i think of this story i want to be better i want to do better , i don t want any silent signs to go unread before my eyes or my heart i don t want to make up my own answers to what must be going on i don t want to assume let s be gentle with each other let s read each other s signs if you enjoyed this post get the
