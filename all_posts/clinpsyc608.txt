here are a few choice snippets from a bioethics forum post by jerald block when does research into a preventive treatment become unethical ? in many areas of medicine this is a familiar question the ethics around immunizations is solidly grounded in such thought however , in psychiatry , wholly preventive psychopharmacologic treatments have been unusual unfortunately , such research is fraught with ethical dangers in a recent study by mcglashan et al , randomized , double blind trial of olanzapine versus placebo in patients prodromally symptomatic for psychosis , it seems psychiatry may have crossed into ethically questionable territory snip in mcglashan 's study , the authors cooperated under a merck and nimh grant and conducted their research in four clinical sites in the united states and canada the study examined whether olanzapine zyprexa could be used in patients that appeared to be prodromal for schizophrenia to prevent or delay the onset of the disease just as some people feel tired or irritable a day or two before getting a cold , the psychosis that is the hallmark of schizophrenia is usually preceded by a motley set of other symptoms changes in personality such as increased anger , anxiety , restlessness , moodiness , apathy , social withdrawal , odd behavior , paranoia , and or declining school performance are often seen by the patients , friends , and family retrospectively , when diagnosing schizophrenia , these sorts of prodromal changes are frequently seen for several months before patients actually become psychotic unfortunately , the prodromal symptoms are also remarkably common , diffuse , and unspecific , especially when one considers that the patient is usually young adolescence is a period of life that is normally marked by tumultuous changes in personality mcglashan s team screened subjects for their study using a set of symptoms thought to be associated with the schizophrenia prodrome they tried to select patients who were not yet psychotic but who seemed at high risk for developing schizophrenia they then randomized their sample , giving olanzapine to one group and placebo to the other they treated each group for one year and then observed them for another year many patients dropped out of the study , and the findings were inconclusive however , the data seemed to suggest that olanzapine might delay the onset of psychosis in those patients that are schizophrenic regardless of the actual findings , though , the study never should have been performed that it was poses a major challenge to the integrity of the controls that ensure research remains ethical the questions above suggest four reasons why the study is so disturbing how likely is it that the disease will manifest ? psychiatrists are not yet able to accurately predict who will manifest schizophrenia the psychological testing instrument the authors used in the study had a large false positive rate in prior studies , to of those tentatively labeled prodromal never developed schizophrenia after up to two years of observation they were false positives in mcglashan 's experiment , of subjects who were given placebo failed to progress to schizophrenia over the two years they were examined thus around half of those treated with olanzapine were getting the neuroleptic for a disease they , too , did not have how likely is it that the treatment will create significant side effects or complications ? during the period of the study , olanzapine was known to be associated with several serious complications specifically , one should worry that , after one year of exposure at doses ranging from mg to mg , patients would develop metabolic syndrome or , possibly , diabetes also , at the time the study went to irb , olanzapine was known to be strongly associated with large weight gains indeed , mcglashan 's paper showed those subjects getting olanzapine gained , on average , about pounds over the placebo group finally , olanzapine , like all neuroleptics , can significantly alter a patient 's personality and or sleep at the doses received , personality and sleep changes would be the rule , not the exception how severe are those complications ? metabolic syndrome and associated diseases , like diabetes , have significant morbidity associated with them with regards to weight gain , there is well established morbidity and mortality risks correlated to obesity finally , it is unclear how the quality of one s life will be affected during and after one year of getting daily neuroleptic forming and solidifying new relationships occupies much of the time in adolescence and young adulthood as neuroleptics affect cognition and emotionality , we might expect olanzapine to influence one 's ability to build relationships , for better or worse how long will such complications impair the patient ? the median age of the subjects was years one subject was remarkably young years old given their young age and the chronic nature of all the complication discussed above , we might anticipate they would have a large impact over the patient 's life snip finally , one should note that the study could affect many more people than the patients immediately involved when you have a trial with so many distinguished investigators from elite institutions appearing in a top notch psychiatric journal , it sends the message to those reading it prescribing neuroleptics for similar patients is alright the article implies that treating a troubled adolescent with a neuroleptic for a year for symptoms that are suggestive of schizophrenia 's prodromal syndrome is entirely ethical i believe we have established no such thing and that such research may legitimate what is , at present , bad practice full story here
