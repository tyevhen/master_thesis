i frequently hear that a swollen tongue indicates qi deficiency it is not so ! in my experience , a swollen tongue indicates phlegm but let us start by describing it first a tongue is swollen when the whole body is larger than normal crucially , a swollen tongue is also somewhat rounder than a normal tongue in very severe cases of swollen tongue , the tongue may be almost perfectly round before describing the clinical significance of a swollen tongue , let us look at the clinical significance of a thin tongue i e the opposite of a swollen tongue as we all know , a thin tongue indicates a deficiency of fluids , which may be blood is the tongue is pale or yin fluids if the tongue lacks a coating it follows , therefore , that a swollen tongue , being the opposite of a thin tongue , indicates that there is an excess of fluids these excess fluids are not normal fluids but the accumulation of pathological fluids , i e either dampness or phlegm i personally relate the swelling of the tongue body more to phlegm than to dampness the latter reflected more on the coating i attach huge importance to the swollen tongue indeed , if the tongue is very swollen , i relate that to phlegm even in the absence of any other symptoms or signs this is after all an important aspect of tongue diagnosis , i e its preventive value if a patient presents with a swollen tongue as in the picture above i definitely resolve phlegm please note that resolving phlegm will not only help any internal disease the patient might have but it would also lead to an improvement of a channel problem as phlegm obstructs the channels please note that a swollen tongue may be without coating we would normally expect a sticky coating this is not at all unusual and it is seen frequently in the elderly it simply means that there is both phlegm and yin deficiency with acupuncture , to resolve phlegm i would use these essential points lu , ren , ren , sp and st other points that may be added are bl , ren , st , ki depending on the type of phlegm and symptoms
