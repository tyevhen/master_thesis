there were two presentations relevant to depression that were given at the uw conference this year the first was from karen dineen wagner , md , phd from the university of texas medical branch in galveston , texas her message was a mix of the old and the new the old is the state of pharmacology of depressed children seems to have changed very little over the past years this seem largely due to the fact that there have been few successful antidepressant trials in children this has led to the state where there are only two fda approved medications fluoxetine and escitalopram based on a total of clinical trials she showed an additional clinical trials of typical antidepressants including that were positive for citalopram and sertraline but an additional negative study for the fda approved medication escitalopram the difficulty in many of these trials is a high placebo response rate in the trials greater than in adult clinical trials she recommended an informed consent approach explaining to the parents any time an off label approach was being used and the rationale for using any medication based approach she also recommended starting with the fda approved medications for pediatric depression her suggested approach to depression in children and adolescents is to start out with an fda approved ssri plus cognitive behavior therapy cbt this is the most evidence based approach with the evidence rapidly disappearing at subsequent levels where the usual augmentation and substitution steps that are typically used in adults were suggested the treatment for adolescents with depression tads study was presented with the recovery rates for fluoxetine , fluoxetine cbt , and cbt alone at , , and weeks were presented the fluoxetine cbt arm had superior results at and weeks but at weeks the recovery rates were similar at versus those are good results for any antidepressant trial and the placebo response rate in this study was more similar to the adult placebo response rate the results of this study were presented as a rationale for using antidepressants in adolescents with severe depression and or suicidal ideation since the response rate for fluoxetine cbt were faster than fluoxetine or cbt alone at and weeks and essentially the same at and weeks the issue of strategies for addressing ssri resistant depression were presented in the form of a previous trial where adolescents with ssri treatment failures were randomized to a different ssri or venlafaxine or ssri cbt or venlafaxine cbt the trial done by brent , et al showed that there was no difference in response rates switching to another ssri or venlafaxine but switching antidepressants and adding cbt produced superior results sides effects were greater for the venlafaxine arm with a slight increase in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate and a four fold increase in skin rashes a complication that i have rarely seen in adults the overall impression was that cbt was the most effective intervention for adolescent depression but i am sure that most psychiatrists in the crowd were left wondering if i ca n't find cbt therapists for my adult patients with depression what are the odds i can find them for my adolescent patients ? to me that has always been the critical shortage in psychiatry not the number of people who can prescribe medications others trials of medical interventions omega fatty acids , ect , tms , bright light therapy , psychotherapies interpersonal therapyipt , family based ipt , and exercise were sparse computer based cbt has always been an underutilized modality and it showed that there were similar response rates between treatment as usual and an interactive fantasy based cbt called sparx smart , positive , active , realistic , x factor thoughts in the game the child chooses an avatar and the goal is to restore balance in a fantasy world dominated by gnats gloomy negative automatic thoughts the sparx game is available free online to residents of new zealand new zealand and australia have been pioneers in the area of online cbt to find resources just google sparx virtual therapy for depression paul holtzheimer , md provided the adult perspective in the topic management of treatment resistant depression in adults he made the epidemiological point that treatment resistant depression trd is present in of patients with major depressive disorder and in the u s that is about of the population he had a fairly comprehensive agenda covering pharmacotherapy and augmentation strategies , electroconvulsive therapy , more recent non invasive electromagnetic therapies and deep brain stimulation there was nothing new on the medication front after reviewing the basic medication groups , he suggested that the newest antidepressants offered no advantage over earlier medication he suggested that monoamine oxidase inhibitors maois were being underutilized as a treatment for depression unresponsive to standard agents in the moderated discussion ned kalin , md the head of the department of psychiatry at the university of wisconsin agreed the speaker said that he typically used phenelzine and tranylcypromine i personally have not prescribed either of these agents in some time i recall using them in situations where the person has treatment resistant depression and did not have any responders in those situations , response rates tend to be low anyway the other problem is that you have to think that your chronically depressed patient is going to be motivated and cognitively intact enough to adhere to the necessary diet , report what could be significant side effects and not try to kill themselves with the medication during the discussion there was a report of one patient who decided to eat high tyramine content food prohibited on this diet due to a the risk of a hypertensive reaction have a stroke and die the patient in this case did have a stroke but did not die i personally know of situations where strokes have occurred , so this strategy is not without risk the augmentation strategies discussed were right out of star d with the exception of using atypical antipsychotics with antidepressants dr holtzheimer said that this was probably the most common augmentation strategy and the risks were discussed he and dr kalin were advocates of augmentation with lithium and triiodothyronine t there were three slides on star d showing cumulative remission and remission rates across all levels of care those rates were with initial monotherapy and after treatments and as expected less remission rates at each level of treatment change dr holtzheimer made the point that the current rates of remission with medication and psychotherapy have really not changed since the s and that makes electroconvulsive therapy ect the most effective antidepressant treatment with a remission rates and a relapse rate in the first months he touched on novel pharmacological agents categorized by neurotransmitter , neuroendocrine , or immunological systems he did not say much about ketamine there is an intranasal preparation in clinical trials right now but did mention that there is a il cytokine antibody trial going on right now he moved on to talk about more invasive therapies he presented a graphic that was a drawing by papez to anyone trained in neuroanatomy around the time i was in medical school , many anatomy professors would present a saggital section of the brain and refer to the limbic structures as the papez circuit at first i thought the drawing had a surprising amount of detail for a publication but then i went to the original article online ama web site and found that the original drawing was not used the drawing had the surface anatomy correct but no tracts papez mentions the amygdala three times in the last few paragraphs of his article but does not label it in the drawing dr holtzheimer used this slide as a prelude to an article by mayberg providing a rational for deep brain stimulation as treatment for depression i plan to come up with a separate post in this technology based on several sources but right now there are a number of centers looking a deep brain stimulation for depression and addiction dr holtzheimer briefly commented on transmagnetic stimulation tms there are apparently fda approved devices , use is expanding and insurance reimbursement is expanding he said it was effective for treatment resistant depression i am highly skeptical of that number based on the people i see , but i also realize that i am seeing a highly treatment resistant with multiple comorbidities seizure risk was listed as the most significant side effect vagus nerve stimulation vns has been around for about a decade i have seen a few of these patients and never referred anyone for placement of this device there is limited third part reimbursement and in my opinion waning enthusiasm for this technology the last time i interviewed a person with vns , their speech quality changed every time the stimulator was active that is a significant side effect and i do n't know if that has been addressed with current technology transcranial direct current stimulation tdcs , transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation , and cranial electrical stimulation were all listed as having limited data deep brain stimulation dbs was clearly the main focus of dr holtzheimer 's presentation the first article suggesting that it may be effective for obsessive compulsive disorder ocd was in the lancet in based on that research dbs of the anterior internal capsule is an fda approved indication for dbs an open label study suggested that it may also be effective for trd and there were no adverse effects or neuropsychological effects three additional pilot studies of dbs to the nucleus accumbens suggested that it may be useful for trd and features of trd like anxiety and anhedonia since then there have been two randomized controlled trials of dbs to the ventral striatum subcallosal cingulate gyrus scc the first study ventral striatum was negative and the second scc was stopped after a futility analysis the overall conclusion had to be that trd was still a common and disabling condition the mainstays of treatment at this point are still the medications and ect that we have had throughout my career my experience is that i can help most people get well , but there are significant obstacles even to standard care every lecturer here emphasized the utility of cognitive behavioral therapy like most psychiatrists , i can do cognitive behavioral therapy but by myself i ca n't meet the demand the people responsible for mental health policy and insurance standards certainly do not want to fund the recommended research courses of cbt for chronic depression there is no distinction for trd versus non trd depression and no differential resource allocation that leaves most patients with trd and non trd depression looking for prescribers who can see them for minute appointments to get advice on how to recover and try various prescriptions none of the available care matches what top researchers recommend in these cme seminars , in articles , or in books we could do a lot better trying to live up to that standard while additional diagnostic and treatment strategies are developed george dawson
