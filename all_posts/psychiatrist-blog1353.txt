clink is on lockdown whatever that means it ca n't be good and it seems to mean no access to the blog , so she asked me to post this for her what are friends for , if not posting for you when you 're indisposed ? judging by the length of this post , it seems clinkshrink may have been locked down for some time now hoping she 's free soon when lawyers call by clinkshrink one of the advantages of being a forensic psychiatrist is that you can interact with lawyers without breaking into a panic occasionally i get calls from colleagues who have been contacted by a lawyer about something , and i can almost hear them sweating over the phone so , i figured it might be helpful to write a blog post about what to do when an attorney calls first of all don't panic i ca n't say this enough the first automatic thought you will have is that you have been drawn into something that will cost you a lot of time , money and emotional distress that 's almost never the case the most common thing that happens is that you might get a subpoena this is usually sent by u s mail , but occasionally is hand delivered by a process server if you do n't read latin all great legal documents are written in latin you wo n't know that there are two types of subpoenas a subpoena duces tecum and a subpoena ad testificatum a duces tecum means that the lawyer just wants records from you the other type means that the lawyer actually wants you to appear for a hearing to give testimony regardless , subpoenas will pretty much always involve a patient you are treating and you may already know if your patient is involved in some type of litigation if you have a high volume practice or a practice with a limited amount of treatment contact say , an emergency room or consult liaison service you may not remember the case if a review of the patient 's chart does n't suggest the reason for the subpoena you will need to contact the lawyer to find out why you were served if you work for a hospital you 're in luck the hospital attorney should be informed immediately about all subpoenas , and you can ask them for advice about what to do next the hospital attorney can call the serving lawyer and tell you what the 'official' response should be the best outcome is that your lawyer will successfully file a motion to quash this means that he or she tells the court that it 's not necessary to subpoena you because either the information you have is completely irrelevant to the legal issue at hand , or the information can be obtained through the records alone , you have nothing to add beyond that , and your actual testimony is unnecessary in other words , he makes the subpoena go away your life goes on as usual if you do n't have a lawyer , or if you do n't want to pay a lawyer how much it will cost to do all this , you will have to call the serving attorney yourself the first rule to remember is collect information , do n't give information this is the information you need to collect who is your client ? , what is the legal issue ? , what information do you want from me about this legal issue ? you should n't offer any information at all until you have these three basic questions answered specifically , do n't say anything about a patient 's diagnosis , treatment , treatment compliance or prognosis the lawyer calling you may not be acting on behalf of your patient and there are a myriad of reasons why you might get contacted a contested custody case , a disability or workmen 's compensation claim , a personal injury case or even a criminal proceeding you could unintentionally harm your patient by giving information to an opposing lawyer you 're probably wondering why i did n't specifically say you should notify your patient first i list that as the second thing to do because most often the person contacting you has been retained by your patient and he or she already knows about it you might need to have a discussion at your next session about why they did n't warn you this was coming ! if this is n't the case , then you need to do some preliminary data collection in order to tell the patient what 's going on thus , patient notification comes second in line to talk to the serving attorney if the serving attorney is working in opposition to your patient , then you need to consult with your patient about how to respond if he or she wants you to participate in the proceedings or to provide records then all is right with the world you might want to prepare them for what you will have to say , but that 's about it things get messy if the patient does n't want you involved at this point the number of possible hypothetical situations make it impossible for me to cover all of them , but generally this is when you need to get a lawyer in certain situations the patient may not have the right to claim or by statute will automatically waive privilege you will have to be involved regardless of the patient 's wishes you will need to address this with the patient and consider how this will affect your therapeutic relationship finally , there is one thing i strongly advise you not to do don't ignore a subpoena it will not go away failing to respond could put you at risk for monetary penalties in a worse case scenario , a judge could sent out a body attachment on you in other words , sheriffs show up in your office to physically take you to court i 've never heard of this actually happening to a doctor , but i do n't want any of our readers to be the first one ok , i think this post just made up for weeks of clinkshrink inactivity
