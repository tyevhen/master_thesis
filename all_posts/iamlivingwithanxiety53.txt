we nervous people can have symptoms over the strangest things a vast array of objects , activities , conversations , and other average , everyday experiences can lead us to vicious cycles the keyword being average we usually develop symptoms about trivialities , and recognizing this can help us overcome uncomfortable sensations for example , i dread buying new shoes hmm , that sounds like tempermental lingo oh , i enjoy having new footwear , but breaking in shoes makes me quite anxious i concentrate on how different the new shoes feel over the old ones , agonize that i might have bought the wrong size or style , and generally work myself up over an experience most people don t give a second thought to at my local recovery group a few months ago i brought up my distress , and perhaps unsurprisingly other members recounted similar experiences i realized that i am not exceptional my sensations are not unique and i certainly can bear the discomfort associated with breaking in new shoes this post probably would seem ridiculous to someone who is not a nervous person , but everyone has little fears and worries we just work them up too much after that meeting i did practice sabotage , unfortunately , by putting the shoes in the closet for a few months and ignoring them , preferring to not bear the discomfort but now i m using several recovery tools for example , i m practicing the concept of part acts i m wearing them on weekends but not during the week i ll move onto that when i m ready plus , i m reminding myself that i can certainly bear this discomfort and as often as i can remember , i m endorsing myself with practice and patience come success , and i hope to be footloose soon
