medical marijuana was legalized in maryland two years ago , and this summer we will be getting our first dispensaries psychiatrists are starting to ask what this means in terms of treating patients roy did a great job summing up some of the research for our colleagues unfortunately , because of the many historical restrictions on research , there is increasing amounts of data available , yet few facts to go by fact as in a thing that is indisputably the case these data are often viewed from differing perspectives such as absolute vs relative risks harm reduction vs harm avoidance public health vs criminalization perspectives use vs abuse eg , plenty people use alcohol without abuse it , getting drunk , rotting their liver same with cannabis that being said , the national academy of science and medicine just put out in january a comprehensive pages report on the health risks of cannabis i have attached the mb pdf file for our mps readers' enjoyment they found about , relevant abstracts to review leaving out another , that did not meet their quality review i was surprised there was that much out there i 'll boil it down to the executive summary level their major conclusion appears to be that , essentially , we need more research beyond that , they divided up additional findings based on the strength and quality of the research strongest evidence there is conclusive or substantial evidence that cannabis or cannabinoids are effective for the treatment of chronic pain in adults cannabis as antiemetics in the treatment of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting oral cannabinoids for improving patient reported multiple sclerosis spasticity symptoms oral cannabinoids a moderate evidence for improving short term sleep outcomes in individuals with sleep disturbance associated with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome , fibromyalgia , chronic pain , and multiple sclerosis cannabinoids , primarily nabiximols limited evidence for increasing appetite and decreasing weight loss associated with hiv aids cannabis and oral cannabinoids a improving clinician measured multiple sclerosis spasticity symptoms oral cannabinoids a improving symptoms of tourette syndrome thc capsules improving anxiety symptoms , as assessed by a public speaking test , in individuals with social anxiety disorders cannabidiol improving symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder nabilone a single , small fair quality trial limited evidence of a statistical association between cannabinoids and better outcomes i e , mortality , disability after a traumatic brain injury or intracranial hemorrhage the above is from the first page of about pages of summary findings , including findings of both benefit and risk that are in the exec summary of the document if still interested , turn to pages to to read the rest and dive deeper if you are really interested as for patient education , i think one could turn these pages into maybe pages of here is what we know and here is what we do n't know of course , where one draws the dividing line is arbitrary , but start with those things that have the strongest evidence , with benefits on the left and risks on the right then people make up their own mind , like anything else a risk benefit discussion would you risk liver failure for headache relief ? here 's two tylenol or four or six sorry if you were looking for a simple answer
