although we ended up with inches of snow a couple of days ago , as i look out into my backyard tonight , the grass is green and there is nary a white patch to be found the snow turned to rain friday , and it rained all day and into the night the rain dispersed some of the snow , and the warm , bright sunshine we had today took care of the rest i even got to run in shorts today ! i ran long yesterday , miles , with my x meter repeats at minute pace , which i never did do on thursday , in the middle of my run combining my long run with speed work was an interesting challenge i was pretty tired after my run and for the rest of the day a nice italian dinner last night with my parents helped perk me up good food and good company typically does that i slept late today wow , that was nice ! jet usually wakes me up just before am , but today he let me sleep until almost eight o'clock ! the sun was already high in the sky by the time i made my coffee i leisurely enjoyed my breakfast in the sun while watching jet romp around outside it was lovely by the time i hit the road this morning , it was past o'clock i had a relaxed , easy mile recovery run i kept a good pace with little effort , and my legs felt fairly fresh apparently , last night 's italian dinner helped me recover well from yesterday 's effort it was so great to run in warm sunshine it was a beautiful day for a great run ! tomorrow i start my level kettlebell and suspension training class i'm looking forward to getting back to it i really sloughed off this past week without it i know the level one class made me a lot stronger this eight week class will take me through grandma 's marathon , and i'm hopeful the added strength will help me run well there my mood continues to be good sorry , it 's probably getting a little boring hearing that week after week , but i 'll take boring over depression any day ! the sun is setting on a beautiful day i'm feeling well just for today , depression remains far far away
