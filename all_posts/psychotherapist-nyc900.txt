yourself and your former love into account , you 're probably setting yourself up for a fall also , you might be faced with whatever unresolved issues thee may have been from the past the following vignette , which is a composite of various cases , is an example of a romantic reconnection that started with a lot of excitement and then began to go wrong sally and george sally and george were in a relationship during their last two years of college at the time , they were very in love and talked about getting married all of their friends considered them to be the perfect couple however , towards the end of their last semester in college , they had a big argument about george joining his father 's manufacturing business rather than pursuing his dream to be a teacher , which is all that he talked about while in college making a difference for young students and helping to shape young minds sally could n't believe that george would give up his dream and give in to his father 's pressure she was furious unlike many teens and young people in their early s , george had never gone against his parent 's wishes and he did n't know how to tell his father no sally also did n't want to move to chicago where george 's parents lived all along , she and george had talked about either living in new york , where she was from , or boston , a city that they both liked by the end of the school year , both of them were heart broken about this argument , but neither of them saw a compromise , so they broke up sally moved back to new york she found a teaching job and an apartment with friends and george moved back in with his parents and joined his father 's firm as an assistant manager neither sally nor george had any contact again until years later when george found sally 's name on facebook initially , when they reconnected by email and then by phone , they were both very excited both of them were now divorced and available relationships romantic reconnections neither of them had children sally had been teaching for many years , and george inherited his father 's business , sold it for a large profit , and eventually returned to his initial chosen profession , teaching they both flew back and forth on weekends and holidays to see each other and they were caught up in a whirlwind romance after the first six months , george moved to nyc and they moved in together he obtained a teaching job and things seemed to be going fine relationships romantic reconnections however , as the initial excitement began to wear off , they each felt that something was missing neither of them could put their finger on what it was , but they each began to feel vaguely disappointed they began bickering about little things , and this was even more disappointing one day , in the middle of an argument , george said to sally , what happened to you ? you 're not the girl that i knew in college this was a turning point in their relationship george regretted saying these words as soon as they left his mouth , and sally was very hurt they both still loved each other , but they recognized that their relationship was spiraling down and they did n't know what to do they decided that , to try to save their relationship , they needed to go to couples counseling after several sessions of couples counseling , they realized that they reentered their relationship hoping to find the same people that they were when they were in college but , in reality , both of them had changed somewhat they were no longer the idealistic young people that they were and time , their divorces , and other life experiences had changed them also , when they broke up in college and all the years since , they were left with the romantic fantasy of what it could have been like if they had stayed together all those years ago now , years later , they were actually living the reality of that experience and while their experiences together now were generally good , the reality of their life together could n't live up to the romantic fantasies that had built up in their minds over the years through couples counseling , gradually , sally and george learned to work out their differences and to let go of unrealistic expectations they also had to work through the initial disappointment that lead to their break up in college sally realized that she had been immature about it all those years ago , and george realized that he was n't assertive enough to be his own person back then within a few months , they became more realistic about their expectations of themselves and each other and
