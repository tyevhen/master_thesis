connection cannot be achieved when the connecting cable corpus callosum has been impaired or thinned out due to early trauma once the event has been dissociated , the right lower brain areas have a mind of their own that is , the energy of the pain innervates lead to , connect to the heart and key organs and begin their ever so subtle damage so that years later , there is a serious illness and no one seem to know where it comes from suddenly the person develops high blood pressure or heart palpitations , or worse , a stroke because the origin is so remote , one could never dream that it was due to a birth trauma the treating doctor says , have you been under stress lately ? not that i know of how can we speak to a brain that has as yet no words ? and no comprehension the suffering component of infancy has direct connections to key organs of the body governed by the right brain the left brain insists that all is well while the right is sending messages to the lungs , immune system , circulatory system , and heart saying things are terrible all done sotto voce after all , it doesn t want to be overheard by the left once the secret is out it has to be dealt with , and the left just cannot do it the truth of the hurt is already out , only it is revealed indirectly through the organs there is a pain in the gut or in the heart ischemia , angina these are the somatic aspects fragments of the memory of an overall pain imprint , which as yet is not conscious and it is not conscious because it is overwhelming in its force remember that there are nerve fibers from lower down that impact the pre frontal brain area that can and do change its structure and function , particularly the right frontal area a primal means putting it all together , connecting the various disparate symptoms into an overall whole in neurosis there is a different brain ucla neuro psychologist allan schore believes that early trauma overrides genetics in our personal development , and i agree the reason for the descent down the chain of feeling to be orderly and methodical is that as we descend , the valence of the pain increases thus , in birth where death may have loomed , the pain is horrible it should only be experienced after many lesser and later pains have been felt if we try to get there with hallucinogens , for example , as some therapists have done , the result is often wild symbolism as the neocortex scrambles to circumscribe and contain it if the therapist sees this as normal and even healthy , then all is lost because the patient is lost he now lives in a labyrinth of convoluted ideas that have no relationship to internal reality instead of feeling that reality , he is encircled and dominated by it early trauma impairs the proper evolution of the right brain so we later misperceive , cannot sense nuance , and over or under react we cannot sense nuance because that is right brain , and we are disconnected from it thus there is a tendency to be literal and not see the implications in certain situations right brain impairment may also cause us to lose our ability to empathize because that too is right side anything that involves feeling , in short , is missing with disconnection it is critical for a therapist to have right brain access , and even more importantly , to be right left brain integrated she must see beyond the words of the patient or more important , see beyond the words of a politician the right brain senses insincerity in the example of the inability to wait , it is clear that unless we go all the way down the chain , we will not have complete resolution and change if we relive the waiting in childhood the need to go home after being in boarding school , we would resolve only a part of the trauma there will still be an urgency about waiting but not so desperate as before what gives waiting its life and death urgency is the birth trauma , which , indeed was a case of life and death this is a general rule about any problem or act out the compulsive obsessive aspect of it is largely driven by preverbal traumas , which are usually pure impulses it is what makes sexual act outs so difficult to treat and unless a therapy arrives at the prototype , they will not be eradicated fully the difficulty here is that first line trauma underlying the act out already has an urgency about it the devilish aspect of this is that there is no way to go deep without first going shallow no visiting the past without first dealing with the present we must obey evolution , albeit evolution in reverse
