i sometimes feel like i keep my life compartmentalized home , family , work , blog , book , friends , chocolate , etc , and i suppose that works for me i 've been on vacation the last couple of weeks and , you know , the world kind of stops in december in a good way but i actually do better when life is a series of goals and tasks , and i get restless without an agenda , especially if i feel like i'm supposed to be vacationing funny , but i really like vacation better when i go away , put down the laptop , and my connection with my real life is severed i have a wonderful house and terrific friends , but getting away is crucial and it 's hard to feel like it 's vacation with an office move and pages of medicare forms that i have n't filled out and wo n't do on vacation the last couple of months , i 've felt over extended and things have slipped i do n't exercise the way i usually do , i have n't been working on the book , i get ideas for blog posts but they just kind of fester and never really form , i want to resume the podcasts but there some issue with a cable and everyone 's new laptops and clink is skiing down some mountain soon to return and roy says all his docs have quit and we 'll never see him again as long as we live except for tomorrow night at the shrink rapper holiday dinner i suppose which ever one of us spills something stinky on ourselves will be the one to write about it oh , organizing fun food events has been the one thing i'm not feeling fuzzy about i still do that well so the new year do you have any resolutions ? i do n't have resolutions , but i do have plans to get sequentially refocused the move is done that was a big one my obligations to our professional society will resume at the beginning of the week , i go back to work , there 's the book to write , my plans to commit myself to some form of daily exercise , and i do miss our podcasts especially the chili okay , i'm rambling , but that 's what i meant by feeling fuzzy
