this is n't a post about psychiatry pretend you do n't know i'm a shrink this is a post by an old person ranting , most specifically by the mother of teenagers , ranting it 's fun until someone gets hurt , then it 's hilarious i saw that on a t shirt recently , and actually the t shirt was being worn by someone my age , the father of two teenagers it pictured a skier stick figure , upside down , and i cringed why is it fun to watch someone get hurt ? why would someone make a t shirt advertising that , and why would another someone buy it and wear it in public ? i do n't get it i grew up in a world where it became very important to be sensitive to others , to be conscious of what one says in terms of race , religion , nationality , gender words are important and if you utter the wrong ones , even innocently , you can be minced i grew up in the north , post civil rights , and attended integrated public schools and gender balanced institutions of higher learning obscenities were bleeped on tv and clarence thomas was on trial for sexual harassment my world started in a sensitive place , it 's grown even more so suddenly , it feels like the pendulum has swung the other direction a complete reaction to interpersonal sensitivity i 've entered somewhat involuntarily , but hey , i had them the world of teenagers words that have always been so powerful and negative , well , suddenly they 're terms of endearment i borrowed an ipod the other day to jog with golly gee , wally downloaded songs and they each consisted of the same three obscene words chanted over and over all i can figure is this culture irreverence perhaps best personified by the ugly and inept words of don imus is a cultural backlash to a world where being politically correct has become so important , so hammered into us i read an article not long ago in the baltimore sun it was about an entrepreneurial young man whose internet t shirt business had taken off what an industrious young man i went to the website , curious here 's one of the shirts he sells you get the idea mostly , the teenage world seems to have some feel for when and where they utter the unthinkable words and phrases amongst themselves , they understand or so i'm told their own code they keep this world hidden , and well they should i may be wrong , but the rules all seem fuzzy as to who can say what to whom , where and when probably , and i may just be old , mr brady , it would be fine if t shirts did n't announce the insensitivity of the wearer the good news is that i found some led zeppelin tunes on the ipod there 's still hope
