for the first time in maybe a month , i set my alarm clock i also got out of bed before a m and i did all the things that i used to do in the morning when i lived my old life shower , dress , put on deodorant , etc even though i'm more or less productive as a thesis writer , there is something to be said about making oneself look presentable it just feels more productive anyway , the point of this makeover was not a part of my newest psychological trick to be productive it was for a job interview today , i peeked back into the real world , if only for two hours there is something comforting about going to an office , like a freed prisoner returning to the safety of his old cell and if i was looking to settle down , said job would be perfect great salary , benefits , steady , etc but it is neither exciting nor soul nourishing , and i probably will turn it down after suffering through my thesis for so long , i need to do something amazing i ca n't sacrifice myself to the gods of commerce yet or can i ? parabolic compass by leonardo da vinci
