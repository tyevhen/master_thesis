integration the child is not the father to the man , only an impressionable embryo casualties ooze between my fingers like congealed blood , unredeemable the little deaths of growing older the genuine smile now forced , the honest glance engineered , the green hope dissembled is adulthood a capitulation , a choice , or a deterioration ? i only know that the inevitable losses we collect by living are best accepted and transformed into a volume of forgiveness equal to the innocence displaced published in solitary harvest amazingly , their archives are still available , just click on the link above they feature two poets by name myself and marc awodey in the early days of the net he was prominent so i was happy to follow him and try to get published in the magazines in which he had appeared i was not his fan neither but neither did i dislike his poetry i took him for a trailblazer in polling art 's worth did editors consider my poems worthy of publication ? i considered him a somebody and i wanted to be one , too this was an important phase to me i should never denigrate the encouragement early e zines afforded me as a poet i wonder where marc is now , and whether i shall disappear as he did , and another writer and friend , alan kaufman he went on to the paying media i 'll give you a hint about today 's piece , which signals a return to normal mood it 's not about time heals all wounds it 's about spiritual work , keeping current with the past , going to your brother before you go to the altar with an offering for some unknowable god as an excuse not to face your human burden habits that help sustain sanity , in other words as the title of my post states , i will not post again until july i know many of you are going on vacation , life goes on , etc nevertheless , and i'm not pulling an oral roberts here , i need to know if enough people benefit from this blog that i should continue writing if of those on my mailing list respond , i will continue if not , i have better things to do with my time i do n't mean this as sour grapes but as a simple calculation of the best investment of my limited talent in the lottery of human need until july if you wish , ce
