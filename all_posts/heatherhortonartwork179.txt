palette , palette and palette a couple of years ago i decided to paint my palette one a year , every year , for my entire career i wanted to do this for a few reasons i think that one 's palette is intensely personal an unequivocally unique it is like a little creative ecosystem with paint mingling , linseed oil spilling , and dried paint being scraped away to make room for a new layer of colour i also genuinely look forward to paying attention to that friend of mine , my palette a friend who never complains and is always there for me a friend who sees my failures and successes , never judges and always accepts i'm a very sentimental person and i also like to think that each palette painting has been from a slightly different epoch in my creative life each one has seen a different group of paintings result from its usage my palette has moved with me to different homes with me as well its peregrinations have echoed mine i use a glass palette , the glass usually being kindly provided by my dear friend gayle who is a framer by trade i line the sharp edges in grey duct tape to prevent getting cut and place white paper underneath so that i can see the colours properly a small paint scraper for at canadian tire allows me to scrape away used paint in between painting sessions this is a practical system as it reduces the waste created by disposable paper palettes i look forward to seeing what my palette will look like it 's like a small smile at knowing that something special is on the horizon i want a red to be sonorous , to sound like a bell if it does n't turn out that way , i add more reds and other colors until i get it pierre auguste renoir
