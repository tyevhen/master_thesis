in case you 've been wondering , i'm okay i'm not great i'm not back to where i 'd like to be yet i wish i was n't still struggling with periods of low mood and intrusive thoughts but i'm back to work , exercising more aggressively , and overall feeling better i really should n't be complaining , but i have to admit i was hoping to feel more than okay at this point in time perhaps my expectations are the problem i'm just back from my third , half day of work i expected my return to work would bring with it feelings of purposefulness , hopefulness , and happiness instead , i felt , well , okay in fact , i struggled with a lower mood before and after work each day i wanted to love my work again i wanted to feel helpful , and grateful , and have a purpose again unfortunately , i experienced that telltale sign of depression , lack of enjoyment , instead it 's hard not to put too much emphasis on any dip in my mood as i come out of this depression relapse i still feel like i'm coming out of it , but i find such periods of feeling low frustrating and scary i have to battle to keep my low feelings from building on themselves otherwise , i feel more sad about feelings of sadness and more hopeless about feelings of hopelessness and that really sucks ! i know because i 've not always been successful in my battle fortunately , i think the ketamine treatment is helping me fight i had my fourth of seven ketamine infusions yesterday i felt almost immediate relief following the infusion despite getting a migraine headache side effect , the mood relief lasted through the evening so even though i'm complaining about feeling okay today , overall i'm much improved as compared to when i began treatment a couple of weeks ago i'm so , so grateful for that and i expect continued relief with continued treatment i'm looking forward to that
