twenty four seconds that was all that separated me and my classmate rachel in yesterday 's triathlon i just found out i won i finished fourth overall , and first among the women hey , that earns me a free minute massage ! nice i could n't tell you where i finished yesterday , because there were three waves of participants i was the first woman in my wave , but i knew there were a couple of other fast , young chicks in the other two waves it 's too bad it would have been really fun to race head to head against rachel i bet we both would have pushed each other to faster times still , i'm pretty excited to have won cool i feel good today actually , i feel like exercising ! i spent my entire first day of work sitting on my butt watching inservice videos there must be over videos for me to watch within the first days of employment , and some of them are an hour long ! and i have to watch them , because i have to test out of every one of them ! ugh ! i'm not used to sitting on my butt at work ! tomorrow , i will be following another p t on four home visits that will be my first taste of home care i'm looking forward to it i 'd rather work with patients than inservice videos any day of the week ! now , i 've gotta take my boy for a walk enjoy the rest of your day the essence of all growth is a willingness to change for the better and then an unremitting willingness to shoulder whatever responsibility this entails from as bill sees it
