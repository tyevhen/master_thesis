with so many antidepressants on the market now , it 's hard to keep them straight the categorizations that have been offered thus far are not uniformly helpful for understanding the drugs' in vivo targets for example , a term like tricyclic refers to chemical structure of the drug molecule itself and tells you nothing about what it does in the brain likewise , a more descriptive term like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor is somewhat misleading in that many ssris actually have a fairly complex binding profile with regard to neurotransmitter receptors for example , in addition to its action at the serotonin transporter sert , prozac fluoxetine has potent htc receptor antagonist effects along with being an agonist of the receptor and then you have the fact that a drug like clomipramine is classified as a tricyclic , yet pharmacologically it shows a great deal of similarity with ssris it can all get confusing in a hurry so the question is how can we visualize what these drugs are doing , without reading long descriptions of their biological activities or trying to digest tables of receptor binding constants ? well , it turns out a team in the netherlands has come up with an interesting way of visualizing antidepressant modes of action at a glance it 's shown in the graphic below derijks et al presented this nifty heatmap in visualizing pharmacological activities of antidepressants a novel approach , the open pharmacology journal , , , they took the known binding constants for various antidepressants and calculated receptor occupancies for these drugs at the ht hydroxytryptamine i e serotonin reuptake transporter , htc receptor , histamine h receptor , norepinephrine reuptake transporter , alpha receptor , and muscarine m receptor , then subjected the results to principal component analysis to arrive at a hierarchical cluster scheme based on bioactivity homologies what they found is that the antidepressants they looked at grouped naturally into four main clusters within the clusters , drugs grouped together based again on similarity of activity at binding sites basically , you can look at any given row in this picture as a kind of barcode or fingerprint , if you like for a particular drug based on its own particular modes of action buproprion wellbutrin shows up as a solid yellow stripe , which might seem odd until you realize the derijks group did not attempt to include dopamine transporter occupancy in its model nor did it look at nicotinic acetylcholine receptor binding , also important for bupropion the group said they tried looking at dopamine transporter bindings but found it did not change the overall classification in four clusters , so they left it out for visualization purposes , it would have been nice if they 'd left it in i think this kind of visual representation of drug activity is a very useful tool for differentiating antidepressants , and if psychiatrists and nurse practitioners knew about it they could use it to aid the decisionmaking process when it comes to trying a non responsive patient on a different class of drug if a drug from cluster does n't work , it 's only logical to try a drug from a different cluster rather than say a different drug from the same cluster in case you 're having trouble with the generic drug names shown in the above figure , here 's a table giving the translations between generic and trade names generic name trade name and category amitriptyline elavil , saroten tca bupropion wellbutrin , zyban citalopram celexa , cipramil ssri clomipramine anafranil tca doxepin adapine , sinequan tca duloxetine cymbalta , ariclaim snri escitalopram lexapro , cipralex ssri fluoxetine prozac , sarafem ssri fluvoxamine luvox ssri imipramine tofranil tca maprotiline deprilept , ludiomil tca mianserin bolvidon , norval teca mirtazapine remeron , avanza teca nefazodone serzone , nefadar nortriptyline aventyl , pamelor tca paroxetine paxil , seroxat ssri reboxetine edronax , prolift nri sertraline zoloft , lustral ssri trazodone desyrel , deprax sari venlafaxine effexor snri nri norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor sari serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor snri serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ssri selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor tca tricyclic antidepressant teca tetracyclic antidepressant
