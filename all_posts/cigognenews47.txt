in our research we had much more evidence of how the liberated pain militated towards the last cerebral defense the neocortex to concoct all sorts of nonsense to explain the inexplicable deep imprinted pain that is preverbal and therefore has no name there exists no words in that repertoire to explain what is happening a true mystery which is now whispered in beneficent tones as the ethereal mystical experience , acclaimed as an exalted experience it seems ethereal because it borders on the religious , unknown , unexplained , out of reach of ordinary intellect it sounds so sweet mystical of the subjects we studied , all took at least ten lsd trips and almost every one had trouble sleeping for months and months even tranquilizers could not lower the activation levels to allow a calm system is that helpful for depression ? yes of course , if we open up the gating system and release the heavy mound of suppression weighing down the system yes , it is a momentary release , but what happens afterward ? is it biologic ? as deep depressive patients travel down into the nervous system there is an accompanying lowering of blood pressure the whole system is approaching fail their feelings of impending death is not mysterious it is truly a state of impending death and the body accommodates and of course as blood pressure dips into deep lower levels , to accompany a system drenched by hallucinogens , there are feelings of approaching death and thoughts of suicide the massive upheaval of pain from the lower depths floods the neo cortex , infiltrating it with such input that concentration is impossible it happens to our patients without drugs when they have undergone an infancy , and earlier , of constant and chronic neglect and abuse the mounting layers of pain soon become laminated agony that no longer can be integrated as patients relive these pains in methodical order they begin to eliminate their anxiety and add the thinking inventing neocortex is the last developed part of the brain and called into service when all else has failed in our therapy patients soon learn what it is and what needs to be done not to call on allah or mysterious forces but on their history to follow messages from the underground that point to stored pain why do i think these power drugs are dangerous ? because it has a lasting effect and upsets the equilibrium of the brain which is now structured to include what the brain already underwent in its ontogeny traumatizing that precious brain can never be considered therapeutic except by those ethereal souls who tend to believe in the booga booga i know , i worked with them , including associates of tim leary , the guru of drugs too often their research falls on prepared minds who can accept the mystical and received wisdom with alacrity the wife of the director of research took me for a walk while high on lsd we started to cross the street when i panicked i looked down at the curb which seemed to me to be a mile down and a dangerous fall i backed up i had no aftereffects from it but knew to use caution for those who are fragile it can cripple the neocortex by opening the lower level gating system and allowing the in rush of immense , unintegrated , very early pain , which can lead to serious mental problems the job of the drug is to open the gates but out comes voodoo land latent imprints from the deep interior that scramble any coherence and replace perception with all kinds of irrationality irrational thinking is an attempt to maintain sanity , to make life experience make sense even in a twisted way we not only see crazy we think crazy we think in the same way that some think when life has piled on trauma after trauma from very early on scrambling is a defense operation that prevents us from facing reality the early reality of beatings and neglect , of no love , of being sent away alone at an early age in brief , my life here is an example from a patient describing the result of a psilocybin trip before entering therapy on the trip sitting in a car looking out the window at the sidewalk which became a bubbling liquid mass it looked like bubbling cement later on when i judged it safe to exit the car in a residential neighborhood , i saw an alligator in the middle of the street these were hallucinations that contained the feelings of my youth fear and terror here was a safe place so the unsafe place was bubbling inside of me the alligator nipping at my heels was only the fear and terror coming at me in symbolic form in my case , further use of hallucinogens would have caused serious damage if i had continued taking drugs , i believe the symbolism would have overwhelmed me because the gating system would not have been able to recover enough to withstand more pressure when preverbal first line imprints of pain are thrown up indiscriminately they first attack the highest levels of consciousness but because the nonverbal content cannot be assimilated and integrated on that level there is an overload of unconnected primal information if pains come up in a cohesive manner one would then be in the midst of primal feelings the problem is that with the drug it rises in undelineated form , vague , putting pressure on the gating system it is coming up out of sequence and cannot be anchored in reality therefore , it takes on a mystical air the hallucinogen does not allow an ordered sequence to develop it prevents a slow unfolding of primal pain to achieve proper connection and instead it opens gates widely allowing pains from several levels at the same time that have no chance of integration those preverbal pains thrown up by the drug , thrust pre birth traumas into the fray long before the person has relived much less forceful hurts and has prepared the way to live deeper pains that is why it takes month to prepare the piste toward the inner depths this is the origin of abreaction , which i have written about extensively those patients who come in and begin to undergo birth primals are often pre psychotic and need tranquilizers , never hallucinogens the level of pain must be heavily controlled lest the patient slips into a beginning mental affliction it is very difficult from that break in defenses to find normalcy again this is also true of those chronic users of marijuana the defense system is called in to help out but it loses its impact after a while and there can then be a break in defenses with strange ideation and hallucinations defenses are weakened so much that often there is no recovery or only partial recovery if they go on with seemingly benign drugs such as hash they may lose their sanity and fall into periodic delusions and paranoia i am against legalizing these seemingly innocuous drugs because they can cause psychosis in fragile souls and they do not liberate anyone or anything in some literature these drugs are classified as hallucinogens a person first taking cannabis may laugh or cry more easily and seems more relaxed and less depressed but over time he will pay a heavier price as mental symptoms appear , not always obvious to him these are also openers of the gates of repression , but more slowly done over great amounts of time their memory system will slowly suffer as will their cognitive abilities we want a free lunch but it is wrapped in a nightmare unwrap the fragile covering and we get open mental illness one serious trauma can produce it at once incest by a parent can produce it as the person who is supposed to protect you becomes the danger i have treated several of these cases the earlier it occurs the more likely the psychosis in europe i once treated the daughters of a nazi officer they both kind of made it until the older daughter found out he was also sleeping with her sister she fell into psychosis it happened more than we imagine among the nazis the trauma was i am no longer loved there may be many roads to nirvana , but all are posted with same sign danger ahead you will lose your mind if you stay on this road only feeling is healing
