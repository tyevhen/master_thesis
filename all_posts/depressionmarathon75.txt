i'm officially home again i left the hospital around this morning fortunately , my house was still intact and standing it 's still a bit strange being home , though the house feels empty even with jet and i in place i need groceries and gas , but i have no funds to spend i'm hoping to head back to work for at least half a day on monday i need to get the funds flowing again i'm looking forward to settling back into my routine at home i'm looking forward to buying groceries and paying the bills i'm really looking forward to getting back to my regular running and exercise routine jet and i ran miles this afternoon that was my first run in more than one week i hate when i take time away like that it 's always so tough starting up again , but i just had no desire to run on a treadmill in the hospital my next race is n't until memorial day weekend , so i should be okay despite my time off i'm a little anxious about being home i think i'm feeling better i think i'm on the mend i'm hoping everything goes smoothly as i return to work and my normal routine ultimately , i 'll just have to wait and see so far , i'm happy to be home i'm happy to be reunited with jet and i think i 'll be really happy to sleep in my own bed tonight !
