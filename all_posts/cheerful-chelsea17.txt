at this rate i 'll be a fortnightly blogger ! i'm afraid there wo n't be a post this evening insomnia has finally taken it 's toll i ca n't remember the last time i slept through the night , it certainly has n't happened in february i suppose this is the risk you take reading my blog , it 's the nature of the illness , it does n't care for schedules no matter how important your day is i never want to let anyone down , i 'd hate to think of someone that relies upon the blog gearing up to read a post only to find there is n't one then again , it would fill me with immense pleasure if i knew that i was helping someone , that they eagerly anticipated my posts each week when times are tough i usually try to rally even if it 's been a hard day , i can usually bring something together for a post i never want to give up on this , writing has helped me so much however , i also do n't want to lose the joy i have for the process putting too much pressure on myself risks flattening that joy and myself in the process fear not , i will return i 'll always make an effort to let you know what 's going on the facebook page i look forward to getting out of this period of insomnia so i can be running on almost full cylinders again !
