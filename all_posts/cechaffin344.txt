kathleen discovered a woman who was giving away eight week old ducks , and having a garden enclosed by a deer fence , i thought i could keep them to control pests so i took two the duck lady delivered them , gave me a book on raising ducks and some feed i released them in the garden within a minute they had waddled down the slope and out through the squares in the deer fence , which i thought would be too narrow for them to escape through not i heard them in the bushes but they would n't come out later they came up the stairs on the side of the garden , and i tried to herd them back into their proper digs this scared them and they fled down and away into the bushes again i fear they have become raccoon bait clearly i must wrap chicken wire around the deer fence should i wish to entertain quackers again call me a duck farmer for a day as for pests in the redwoods , you have n't lived until you 've seen a banana slug i once picked one up with my bare hand it took six washings to begin to get the feeling of slime off my fingers the pacific giant salamander eats them i have a friend who saw a salamander actually stalking a slug it was just like a cheetah on a zebra , or so it seems to us redwood dwellers who are used to watching trees grow but we do have bears , bobcats , mountain lions , weasels , foxes , raccoons , and no poisonous snakes and you say , you live in california ? yes just do n't tell anyone ducks and slugs certainly qualify as ordinary let 's see if i can find another ordinary poem nothing to say i have nothing needful to say , no comment on the glittering bay or the dark , snow topped wall of the san gabriels things used to be pulled from me , uprooted like weeds from a garden i let the weeds bloom now the red throated bird that lives in my chipped balcony light sings for a mate i have never seen i let my words run like watercolors time runs only forward why should art be different ? here is the last line ce
