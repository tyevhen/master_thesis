so , i have been in a very bleak period of depression for more than a year now , brought on by some publishing fucktardery , and i 've been fighting the losing battle of trying to tell people that my fish are dead see the wonderful allie brosch , esp the allie brosch fish post and you 'll get that one but today i am here to peek my tired eyes up over the blanket hiding my fetal position and admit that i might be getting a shipment of brand new fish now , they 'll probably be like me , fragile and a little bit broken , but they will surely have some hint of optimism and the slightest feathering of remembered joy i hope i never lost it , even in the darkest times , this hope even when it was reduced to only a withered thing stretching her trembling hands out into the dark i 've found her again , and made her soup , some of my quite good chicken vegetable homemade and some of my even better hot and sour also homemade and tomorrow i might ply her with homemade turkey chili i want to feed her up so she does n't waste away into one of the more nebulous emotions , or turn into vapidity or despair i'm crying while i write this , which is harder than you might think because i'm a tough old trial lawyer and there 's no crying in litigation , as more than one partner told me back in the day but today i am crying , because i worry that i 've let you down i cannot write books in months like so many indie authors these days i would n't even try to sometimes , it might take nearly two years or even a little longer to get a book from me because my editor has to pry them from my cold , almost dead hands because of the harsh perfectionism that is at the root of much of my depression it 's the noose i use to tie up the bundles of my dead fish but today , i tried to be healthy and happy both on the same day i did not invite the tragedy train to the station as my darling navy guy sometimes accuses , and i did not threaten my son with coming home to live in our non existent basement once he flunks out of college well , okay , not more than once , and i did not get caught up in a teen drama and i figured out my severe vertigo was because i had forgotten to take my anti depressants for or days in a row don't do this ! ! ! and just when i was starting to fall down on the floor with my dead fish and cry , i remembered that i have all of you , who have shown me crazy kindness and boundless love and understanding so hey send some of that stuff this way i will snuggle with all of you so thank you you rock hugs , alyssa website twitter facebook
