there is an ache in the center of my chest it is depression it 's terrible and familiar hard to believe an empty hole can yet be filled with so much pain an ache loud and obnoxious , demanding and debilitating , yet somehow silent and secret from all around it is this diabolical ache , this empty pain which makes pounding the fists in frustration perfectly reasonable an empty invisible hole ca n't hurt ! but it does it makes no sense pounding the fists creates actual pain and actual pain is so much easier to deal with than a nebulous , invisible , soul sucking ache i hate the ache
