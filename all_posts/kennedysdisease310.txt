i am taking the day off from writing it has been good to just get away from the computer our children bring us a lot of joy and , they never really grow up in our mind s eye they will always be our little girl or boy even though they are adults it is our privilege and right as a parent to want to hug them and protect them , no matter what their age to all you fathers out there , have a great day
