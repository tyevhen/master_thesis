i'm dating a new guy mr actually it 's a bit of an odd one for me , it 's easy , a slow burner but actually , mr actually seems quite kind , actually i met him way back in february and he was one the crops i 've been farming for the last few months i 've been having fun with the dating game and i am still having fun , i am definitely in no rush to fall into anything in fact , i'm not i will ever let myself fall for anyone again i do n't even think that 's a bad thing recently i 've been chatting to the younger girls at work about their dates and guys they all get so excited and are so 'loved up' , i'm not sure i will ever feel like that again i simply do not trust myself , i do n't trust my own judgement i 've fallen for the wrong guy three too many times as sad as it sometimes feels , to be all emotion less , i do feel more in control , more sensible and less likely to put up with nonsense from these boys it 's going to take a real good one for me to trust and fall in love with , unfortunately for them it 's not going to be an easy think but maybe i 've fallen too easily in the past , maybe i was too naive and too in love with the idea of being in love i ca n't spend too much time worrying about how i feel my feelings are my feelings , i ca n't change them , i just have to roll with it plus i'm actually going away to ibiza next month i have a bikini body to work on , actually
