my last two posts resulted in no comments , at least so far i can understand how a cheap dvd player with a toothache can be ignored , but it does puzzle me just a wee bit why no one responded to my nearly dying was it my tone ? did the style of my droll recollection undermine anyone taking me seriously ? where are you pat , or you , jennifer , or you , norm ? i forgive laurel because she recently posted in my quest for fame and glory , death is the last card to play , and it 's too soon for me , as my reputation as a writer must occur sometime in the future , as i am too old to die young and misunderstood i prefer old and misunderstood anyway , as i have some perspective about how no one is truly understood to the degree they had hoped sure , we are all much more alike than otherwise , but none of us can really imagine the world from inside another 's head even when descartes reduced himself to a single thought , you have to wonder what kind of mind would seek that kind of vacuum , and whether he could maintain a limited consciousness without secondary comments floating through his mind from his other presumptive selves i sometimes think that perhaps a native , an aboriginal , might live in real time that his only conversations are with others , that no debate goes on inside his head he does n't think i'm going to hunt he hunts he does n't think what shall i cook ? he cooks what 's available or does n't because nothing is and he does n't ask if his hunger is a sign of some god 's disfavor to have a natural consciousness is it just a dream of western man ? could such peace exist internally ? are our interior discussions a result of civilization ? is the education of civilization therefore psychotic , or psychosis promoting ? many times in my poetry i have sought the zen moment of forgetting myself in nature , when there was no word for ocean here 's an unpublished example , one of a very few poems written during my internship half a lifetime ago after rain after the thunderstorm s crackling resonances the air blinks once and in the still , unoccupied space the birds begin their chant as if by signal in the tall juniper there is a conspiracy among them or between them and the sky their bamboo bones divine the air s pulse and news travels quickly through delicate throats their speech is not our speech but as if one mouth were speaking it is not relief they feel or joy as we know it but crescendo , counterpoint , what the proper sound is after rain i have other poems that more strain to enter into the moment than describe it , but they are usually not successful , as language breaks down into some unavoidable abstractions after all , in my imagination , the aborigine does n't think , kill lizard he kills the lizard i do n't want to go tom sawyer on my audience , but people come here each day to read something , whether my latest blog or something in the archives that not one would comment on my brush with death puzzles me there , i said it again and if i were to die , would i be missed artistically ? would my essays , poems , ramblings , unpublished books , songs , cds , the whole enchilada would anyone miss them ? or would only my loved ones be tempted to read or listen because it reminds them of me the way i look at photographs of my late daughter , rachel speaking of which , i broke my rule again here 's the first poem i 've written about her death on rachel s death foam rolls like lava down the dark rock islands , waterfalls of seawater , seafalls of saltwater down the dark rock , past the phalanx of gulls standing motionless in gray and white , the colors of my beard an old one limps , his yellow foot more crooked than this line i used to joke that you gave me the most white hairs the ocean sobs at how you died like marilyn with her panties on these details are what police write , like the man with the red flag in his pocket supervising sand , how your hair was red i know i promised to forsake poetry , and i have for the most part , but sometimes an exception bubbles through i suppose my death would provoke as little comment as my near death did it 's a big world out there , and the craft of writing earns a smaller and smaller audience my thanks to whomever reads this , and no , you do n't have to comment on my near dying it 's moot now that i'm alive or is time past present in time present ? kilorat , ce
