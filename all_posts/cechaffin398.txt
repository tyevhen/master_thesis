sad harvest there is no madness like hatred of self it s not confined to those with diagnoses there is a poison book upon the shelf that makes allowance for all psychoses you wake you dread yourself you dread your mind where deadening thoughts orbit like lifeless moons , still , have sufficient gravity to grind your music down to an ice cream truck s tune wake , you could wake but how would you even know ? the vulture on your shoulder keeps you blind communicate by smells by touch by show endure your looping brain pause is rewind sad harvest that a human being should turn upon itself shackle , beat and burn if the sonnet is depressing , well so it is i am not well i am more pretending to be well than formerly , seeking activities to distract the central maelstrom of self despite i wonder if any here have read the chronicles of thomas covenant the unbeliever throughout the book the protagonist preserves a despite for himself , no matter how much he helps the land to which he s been transported he s more than a reluctant hero he s a self despising , cynical hero who feels helpless and at the same time responsible for much of the tragedy that besets his new world i don t claim to have his powers , naturally , but i identify with his feelings toward himself i think the series is pretty good for the fantasy genre how shall i greet the new year ? same as it always was these artificial divisions of time do little to center me , though those who celebrate en masse must enjoy a different experience i d like to wear a lamp shade on my head , but i ve only done it once at a party with fellow psychiatric residents except that we be surrounded by other revelers , it is hard to capture the spirit of a holiday there is the religious exercise for christmas , but i am not that devout church makes me weep anyway i m fragile i m not well i refrain from crying , it upsets my wife sometimes i can t help it i wish i could say the new antidepressant has improved things , but it only did so temporarily , and then my melancholy descended back in its miasmic inevitability nine months of depression for a manic depressive is not unusual but it is extremely painful , and it seems the brief happy times i have had within that span are such anomalies that i can hardly relate to them clearly i need for more social interaction while involved with other people i feel better , think less about myself the afterglow lasts about an hour but it is better than no contact at all i am , after all , a gregarious person when not beset by a major depression to encounter me now would be different i am not that person , more of a listener , more of a background shadow but if buoyed up by the circumstances , by the conversation , i can occasionally exceed my melancholy and participate and once i do i am well received as an interesting person little do they know how much i bore myself i m truly sorry to begin this year with another confession of depression , but the tears that crease my face as i write can admit no other truth , and dissembling on a blog would make a blog pointless unless it was simply a shill for promotion back to kilorats , ce
