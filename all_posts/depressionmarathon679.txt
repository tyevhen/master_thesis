i'm recovering today from my third ect treatment so far , things have gone well , and i do believe i am feeling better overall i think being in marathon shape has allowed me to recover quickly from the anesthesia in fact , today i was up and eating within the hour in the past , when i had ect six years ago , it often took me most of the day to get moving again i'm grateful it seems to be easier on my body this time i'm also grateful to be feeling a little lighter yesterday my social worker noticed my sarcasm was back for her , that 's always a sign i'm feeling better in reality , maybe it 's a sign i need to be nicer to my social worker but she 's right i am feeling a little better i 've smiled more , and i 've even laughed a bit over the past couple days it 's easier to be out of my room , but the thought of being around a lot of people outside of the hospital still overwhelms i'm thinking about being out of the hospital because i found out i will be discharged on friday after my fourth ect treatment i will have two more treatments as an outpatient next week , and then we will assess if i need more i hope not yet , i do n't want to stop too soon either i will discharge to my friends' home , as i cannot drive for the duration of my treatments plus two weeks bill and cindy have graciously offered to take me in again i hate to impose my schedule on my friends , but i guess this is what friends do for one another at least that 's what everyone here keeps telling me still , i hate to impose i'm going to have to do a lot of swallowing of my pride over the next several weeks and be willing to ask for help it 's either that , or i 'll be sitting quietly at home an awful lot ! perhaps the humility will do me some good i 'd be lying if i said i was n't nervous about leaving the hospital as i stated earlier , i'm still overwhelmed by the thought of being back out in the world i'm medically off work until late may , so at least i wo n't have to face that stress right away and perhaps not having to face work stress will make the rest of life 's stressors a little bit easier i hope so one day at a time , etta one day at a time
