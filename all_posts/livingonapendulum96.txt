ever since the day recently where i was ready to throw in the towel actually i ca n't say i am anywhere near out of the woods , i am very much struggling but hiding it well i have been trying to connect with people who know , who understand i 've been doing this by reading the blogs of people with either chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia see links to other blogs on my page up above i am torn between thinking omg , poor them , their life sounds so difficult ! and oh wow , i must be a pretty damn amazing person to be able to do all that i do , every day , every hour no matter how little it seems to me because i am able to do so much more than these people but with a condition like fibromyalgia fms and chronic fatigue cfs where symptoms cannot be measured , how can we tell who has it worst ? with blindness or diabetes , there are physical aspects that can be measured to determine who is more blind or who has a bigger problem , but with fms or cfs , they are diagnosis 's of exclusions essentially , they did not find anything to explain our pain , our fatigue or any of other other symptoms so , by not having anything to measure our levels , how can we honestly say that i have less pain than the person next to me can i say i have more ? does the fact that i manage to do more mean that i am automatically in less pain or less tired ? i wish there was a way to measure , to prove , to tell as it is , the general consensus is that i am lazy and do n't have much guts ? will ? there is no good translation for the expression i am looking for coeur au ventre then there are the doubters , those who think i do n't really have cfs or fms they think i am just using it as an excuse there is another group of people who think , feel , know or think they do that if we were to address the mental trauma that caused the cfs or fms , that it would go away it 's merely our unwillingness to face some psychological issue that is the cause of all our issues if i had someone to take care of me , if i had a doctor who was willing to believe my pain , my exhaustion , if i had an option to survive without working , would they understand more ? would they get it ? looks from many of the blogs i read that they do n't get it even under those circumstances i live with pain every day a lot of pain i drink massive amounts of caffeine to be able to stay alert , to function at least enough to do my job i spend a fortune on a mixture of ibuprofen mg acetaminophen mg and naproxen mg several times a day i take now mg of gabapentin but it does not help every day , it helps less and less but makes me light headed none of it helps the depression , i cannot take ssris nor snris as they cause manias and i refuse to take all the other meds mood stabilizers that make me gain weight gabapentin causes weight gain too , but less functioning every day is very difficult , but it seems like very few are even willing to acknowledge how hard it may be for me seems like i am not alone in having a hard time being understood yeah it does make me feel a bit better , but not by much thanks for reading
