living with anxiety is self torture we constantly worry , check ourselves , and obsess over some things and , eventually , everything well , i'm getting out of the business of this self torture i 've tired of abusing my mind with these endless thoughts and worries of course , it 's not as easy as saying that 's enough ! and poof ! anxiety disappears but i think resetting our attitude toward ourselves and our mental health is part of our recovery this has n't been easy for me , to accept the unknown and the supposed risks but i have to do it to get better this means just doing what i have to do and dealing with the anxiety without letting it overwhelm me this is scary , and it 's difficult but it 's the only real path to recovery i see giving these thoughts any more credibility wo n't help
