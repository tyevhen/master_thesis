on average not of the time boys have more physical stremgth but on average not of the time i have noticed girls have more mental strenght and will power than boys they have mental strength to watch what they are eating and i think canon average handle physoclogical pressure better than us do you agree ? btw im not a sexist so no one list bad fuc comments answer i don t know what you mean by mental strength but neurologically , women have more connections between the emotional centers and judgment centers of their brain than men do this gives women an advantage at understanding the source and ramifications of their emotions and might give them better control over how they use them but i think a more likely explanation for women appearing to have more self control in many societies is societal pressures and cultural mores the u s for example presents women with a paradox that requires them to have a certain degree of mental fortitude in order to be successful and equal , they must often emulate certain male characteristics in order to be sexually desirable , they must meet the western ideal of femininity these expectations on both ends puts a lot of mental stress on women in western society in effect , they may have more mental strength than men do , simply because they have higher expectations than men do question what are some good books to read ?
