the imf 's debt sustainability analysis dsa for greece has been leaked full copy here , courtesy of ft , and it may well prove a game changer it basically confirms what greek pm alexis tsipras and finance minister yanis varoufakis have been telling us and the ecb for some time greek debt , as currently structured , is unsustainable even under best case scenarios greek pensioners wait outside a bank according to imf , greece will need over billion over the three year period from october to end p item imf says further concessions are necessary to restore debt sustainability specifically , imf suggests to extend the grace period to years and the amortization period to years on existing eu loans see p , item the dsa also talks extensively about haircuts the need for ecb to recognize actual losses , thereby reducing amounts owed it 's hard to overemphsize the importance of the findings in imf 's sustainability analysis the imf document shows that the relief packages being offered to greece by ecb have been ridiculously underpowered and ecb knows it it proves that ecb negotiated in bad faith ecb fraudulently enticed greece to take loans it knows greece ca n't pay this is criminal , predatory lending activity , by definition in most civilized countries , it 's illegal imf is no dummy , and neither are greek leaders imf shows , in its dsa , that greece would n't qualify for further imf loans even if it had n't defaulted on june the june default technically , an arrears moots any further imf payouts for greece , but that 's okay the dsa shows greece was at the end of that particular road already anyway the imf document changes everything , because no future debt talks can ignore its findings the truth is out in the open greece needs better terms it 's not open to question any more imf sides with greece on the basic question of debt sustainability latvia 's outgoing president andris berzins offered a shockingly accurate observation in an interview with latvian independent tv recently , when he said this greek debt is so big that everyone understands that it won t be repaid indeed , greece 's total debt billion is so large , if a crowdfunding campaign were held tomorrow , every human being alive today on earth would have to contribute the outgoing latvian president also said loans to greece have just bought time so that those in power don t have to take decisions this is like a game who can hold out longer by not showing that this money has been lost ? this burden has become bigger and there obviously is no possibility to repay of course , taking a writedown on greek debt the only realistic way forward is political suicide for the likes of angela merkel , because it would signify that the cost of the greek bailout has been passed directly to german taxpayers germany is not the only debtholder , of course other zone countries , and their taxpayers , would absorb the cost of a haircut as well this is why merkel will fight debt forgiveness to the death , even though germany itself benefitted immensely from debt forgiveness in post war years and greece was one of the signatories of the london conference in the meantime , the greek referendum has become in addition to its other meanings a vote of confidence , or no confidence , for the country 's leaders both tsipras and varoufakis have said they 'll step down if the vote is not a resounding oxi here 's hoping greece votes no to predatory lending and further unsustainable by imf 's own definition debt the alternative is more payday loan chicanery , leading inevitably to an involuntary default on debt that 's no longer capable of being repaid under any forseeable scenario be sure to join us here tomorrow for our friday water cooler links our best of the best freakonomic news links
