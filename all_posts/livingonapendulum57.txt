i love living in my dream land i think i may love it too much i get annoyed when my real life interferes with my dream land i have to work at accepting the real world and then making the most of it but i love my dream land i really really do in my dream land i have enough money to transform my environment to just what i like see this previous post for some ideas on that in my dream land i have enough energy to do a lot of the work that needs to be done to get my environment to where i what it see this post for more information in my dream land i have more time to dedicate to the things i love i work less cause i can afford to work only part time and have more vacations and since i have no such thing as fibro , i need to rest less , sleep less thereby giving me all that extra time also in my dream land i loose weight i become thin and beautiful again i become lovable and enjoyable i can do all the physical activities i like without looking weird , i can eat foods i like without getting that look they give fat people who eat fattening stuff in my dream land i can draw and paint beautifully i can also sing any song i like without causing people pain my notes are not always representative of what they should be every time i look at something , i see the potential of what it could be i see the beauty hiding under the surface i just do n't have the means to make them all that way of course in my dream land my children are perfect they are perfect just like i am perfect perfect in my dreams , not in real life by any stretch of the imagination in my dream land i have the perfect lover yes this might surprise some people that i dream of a relationship when i am so adamant of not wanting one in real life i do n't want a relationship in real life because i am disgusted with myself i cannot be an equal and worthy partner hating myself like i do i am also much too fussy i do not want to be with a person who would be satisfied with what i am a person who would want me ca n't help but be a slob if he does n't mind my messy home , he would not be very fit or take very well care of himself he 'd have to be a reflection of me to be satisfied with me i hate me , i disgust me , so i do n't want a mate that is like me so i do not want a relationship makes sense right ? back to my dream land everything is so wonderful there , i hate emerging to face reality reality is not fun it 's full of work , pain , responsibilities , problems , disappointments and so on and so forth thanks for reading ! you might also like falling in love , what is love ? broken mirror ? ? ? happy holidays , season 's greetings linkwithin
