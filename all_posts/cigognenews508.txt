views of suggestion while suggestion is necessary for trance , it also occurs outside of hypnosis most of us respond consciously and unconsciously to suggestions on a daily basis and throughout our lives for instance , we buy certain products and choose certain brands for reasons we are not aware of , having been influenced by hypnotic suggestion used in advertising most children 's personalities are shaped out of direct and indirect parental suggestion the parent tells the child to be good or keep quiet , or throws her a look to the same effect the child obeys if she knows what 's good for her trying to please her parent or to avoid punishment , she cooperates she is no longer spontaneous instead her behavior adheres to the parent 's instructions many of us grow up not ourselves , more intent on not making waves and catering to other people 's desires than on expressing our own individuality barber contends that the fact that suggestion operates in everyday life is precisely the point which invalidates the concept of a special hypnotic state yapko agrees the trance state is a state differing from everyday mental experience only by degrees and not kind there are no clear demarcations from the usual state to the trance state trance logic , or the hypnosis subject 's unquestioning acceptance of suggested reality , no matter how illogical it may be , also occurs outside of hypnosis it happens when a person lacks the critical thinking ability to objectively analyze whether something is real or not , such as when someone fervently believes in heaven or in his guru 's prophecy that armageddon is coming according to barber 's research , trance is not necessary to elicit hypnotic type responses but suggestion and credibility are when hypnotic induction procedures are helpful , it is not because the subject is in a trance or hypnotized in the popular sense of these terms instead the evidence indicates that they are helpful when they reduce the subjects' critical attitudes toward the suggestions and thus help them accept the suggestions as believable and harmonious with their own ongoing cognitions although hypnotic induction procedures are effective in reducing critical attitudes in some subjects , more ordinary procedures are often equally effective non hypnotic procedures that have been shown to produce a high level of responsiveness to suggestions , presumably by reducing critical attitudes , include a exhorting subjects to try their best to imagine those things that are suggested task motivational instructions and b urging subjects to put aside their critical attitudes and to let themselves think with the suggested themes for barber the essence of suggestion as a behavior shaping force is credibility , and credibility requires a reduction in critical and evaluative abilities thus , any technique which achieves this be it exhortations , urgings , or mild advice could be called a hypnotic induction technique charismatic politicians , among others , can induce a sort of waking trance in some people , making them feel hopeful when a sober analysis of reality might lead to very different emotions barber additionally reports that suggestion has been shown to successfully block the skin reactions normally produced by poison ivy like plants to give rise to localized skin inflammation that had the specific pattern of a previously experienced burn and to cure warts and stimulate breast development in adult women he hypothesized that 'believed in suggestions , ' which are incorporated into ongoing cognitions , affect blood supply in the localized areas to produce the above phenomena here the key term is believed in suggestions i shall discuss the role of ideas in altering behavior in subsequent chapters for erickson , suggestion was an important element in inducing trance he agreed with barber that suggestions had to be believed in and incorporated in order to be effective but he focuses not so much on getting the subject to believe as on evoking and utilizing the subject 's own innate potentials in contrast to barber , erickson viewed hypnotic suggestion as something qualitatively different from non hypnotic suggestion a means of communicating new , therapeutic ideas that would block or alter old , non therapeutic ideas ordinary , everyday , non hypnotic suggestions are acted upon because we have evaluated them with our usual conscious attitudes and found them to be an acceptable guide for our behavior , and we carry them out in a voluntary manner hypnotic suggestion , by contrast , is different in that the patient is surprised to find that experience and behavior are altered in a seemingly autonomous manner experience seems to be outside one 's usual sense of control and self direction for erickson , trance is a special state that facilitates the acceptance of suggestion for barber , trance is a fallacious term for procedures that reduce critical faculties and thereby facilitate the acceptance of suggestion however , both view the acceptance of suggestion as a process involving the reduction of conscious mental processes in one way or another suggestion , therefore , is a matter of the mind , of suspending the subject 's critical thinking the trick is to word and present suggestions in such a way that they are accepted by the mind and then acted upon by both mind and body so that the hypnosis subject will begin salivating as she gets ready to take imaginary pieces of divinity fudge from an imaginary tray trancework , p t x
