jack completed pre k today i let daddy pick him up from his last day of school , he had taken some time off and i was swamped at work , so it made practical sense it did , however , involve me literally sitting on my hands feeling sentimental i guess it 's probably good that i did n't go , might have embarrassed myself by sobbing or hugging his teachers a little too tightly the team at oak hill has been excellent to jack , it has been such a relief to work with them after our experience with jack 's year old preschool class jack 's preschool teacher was clearly very stressed out by him , and after the school year ended , the school system ot she provided services in jack 's private preschool setting disclosed to me that she had repeatedly asked that he be pulled from the classroom which was very different from the story she was feeding me i think this is part of why i was so nervous for much of this year no need , these teachers , including the special educator and ot are class acts patient as can be and very supportive i got something i was n't expecting in jack 's school bag today a final update to his iep i am going to post the comments below jack is very good at assimilating into many situations , and so i think that people who do n't spend a lot of time doing focused activities with him may have difficulty even recognizing that there are any issues that makes me happy it will serve him well in life here is what they had to say jack requires an average of prompts to complete the assignment task activity presented to him when called on , jack was able to offer on topic information during instruction of the time jack was able to independently follow classroom routines of the time jack requires an average of prompts to maintain focus on the task at hand in large group instruction , jack was able to attend to the speaker by independently positioning himself facing the speaker of the time jack has varied interests in specific topics and knows a wealth of information about those topics jack is a very nice little boy damn straight ! ! ok , so just to be clear , this shows huge improvement at the beginning of the school year he screamed when music was turned on in the classroom , required a special seat to remind him to sit during circle time , and brought home blank worksheets much of the time ot wise jack is showing nice strength increase in his hands hooray ! when jack is focused on task , he is demonstrating the ability to use classroom materials with minimal assist he is opening classroom tools such as glue stick , scissors and markers this is huge for him he continues to work on pressure when using the tools he is working on sitting tall in his chair when working and using his non dominant hand as a helper sooooo at the beginning of the school year , jack had still not declared a dominant hand as a matter of fact , it was the subject of much discussion this past winter , when his school ot was calling him a righty and his private ot was calling him a lefty and the private ot wins ! to be fair , she sees him twice a week and the school ot saw jack twice a month now that we have a hand to focus on , the progress has been much more steady we will need to do a lot of work this summer just maintain the progress we are blessed that our current nanny used to be a preschool director and literally brings daily worksheets that she prints out for him everyday when nate is at school , she takes the time to have jack write , color and cut he fights it , but i have noticed that the more confident he becomes the less he fights nate gets weeks off , and then his school resumes for most of the summer the infants and toddlers program has recognized that the little ones cannot be away from their routines for very long or they will lose all of their progress thankful for that we are on day of curcumin right now the pharmacy where we get nate 's b , which is in ohio , has their own special formulation of curcumin that is supposed to be more bioavailable so we went with that i am waiting for nate to realize that he has spices in his juice but for the moment , he is drinking it we are waiting with baited breath for side effects die off is not uncommon with this supplement explanation of those symptoms is below http www leesilsby com enhansa php it will take weeks to get him up to the full dose , then we will add the two other supplements , one at a time today nate said bird for the sitter and something approximating goodnight to indicate to me that he wanted to read goodnight moon at bedtime
