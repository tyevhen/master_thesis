there 's been a bit of upheaval at the house all will be well , but in the mean time , i'm trying to blog more and get some more clicks over at psychology today clicks support the writing and research i do and they are much appreciated ! there 's a new post up about ketamine , the noncompetitive inhibitor of the nmda receptor that , in one single iv infusion , can alleviate a suicidal depression in about minutes however , the magic does n't last , and depression comes back after a week or two still , the mechanism and understanding of this phenomenon is important to figuring out the physiology underlying depression for right now , ketamine is being used experimentally in hospitals and also in some salvage clinics where folks who 've responded poorly to other treatments pay for to get a short break from depression other nmda receptor antagonists might be useful drug targets for experimentation but to be honest glutamate has been the holy grail neurotransmitter for several psychiatric disorders schizophrenia , major depressive disorder , and bipolar disorder among them for the past years , and i 've not seen anything come of it , or anything new in the drug pipeline that has panned out the supplement nac utilizes the glutamate pathway via a somewhat convoluted mechanism i 've seen it work for obsessive thoughts , hair pulling but never for picking behaviors in general and , interestingly , bipolar depression when every other treatment has already been tried there 's only one study for bipolar depression , but the trichotillomania efficacy is solid and nac should be part of the clinical arsenal for that symptom here 's the post the ketamine key and here 's a new lorde song i like a lot yellow flicker beat
