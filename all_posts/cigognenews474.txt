with my tongue slightly in my cheek i want to offer an idea i have held for a while we make a minister of grace and mercy in the cabinet her job , and must be her is to make sure we are all happy first of all , that is a tall order since almost no one knows what real happiness is so let me say at the outset that the best way to be happy and content and to have a great deal of your self is to have been loved throughout childhood if you have them parents you will have yourself if they fulfilled your needs you will be whole and content throughout life no one else can make your happy so what can my minister do ? she can go into the schools and pick out the problem children , and instead of punishment she will explain about the imprints and pain and use the child s hurt to explain his act out he will learn about himself and finally how to control himself , and the other kids will also learn about feelings and how they drive all of us so a big piece of what goes on in school , many hours a day , will not be wasted but will be used as the key learning experience , much more important than learning about this war and that they will learn what it takes to get along with others and how feelings interferes with it or enhances it they will learn what goes wrong with marriages and why they will learn why people get sick and how repression fits in with all this it will indeed be merciful it will save a good deal of misery and help people be happier remember , being fully loved is what makes us happy all the rest is playing catch up but that is important , too then my minister will hurry over to hospitals and teach the kids about their illness , what it really entails , how it happens and exactly how the therapy will work here the child learns about medicine his body and medication and therapy he learns what diets do to the system and why no more mysteries we use the child s experience to learn from that is a good way of learning out of personal experience you say doctors don t have the time well that will be the job of my minister of grace and mercy she will be very busy but she will save so much suffering and money no more special schools for disobedient kids they will learn about themselves and then help other kids who better to do it ? it is being done is some prisons yes , for a while we need all the institutions for neurotics but there is something we can do about it my minister will organize child rearing and birth giving practices in many communities so that we all have a better shot at life just simple things like not giving heavy anesthetics to those giving birth like putting the baby immediately with the mother , and on and on like teaching that hugs and kisses are essential throughout childhood boys need it too and not just to the age of five that children need their parents , not boarding school , usually a dumping ground for harried parents they need individual attention throughout childhood and above all , let s the get idea of homework straight i recently was at the house of a friend who was trying to get his son to do his homework it is a tough but good school , he argued to me and i thought , wouldn t it be better to play with him , to talk to him about life and love , to hug him and kiss him , and then help with his homework because all this will help ensure his happiness , and isn t that what we are all after a well child is one who will be successful whether he does all of his homework or not but that homework needs to be secondary to making the child happy my minister needs to rush in and warn against tough schools they are not necessarily the best oh ! , you say , he must learn or how will he succeed in life make him happy and he will succeed do not worry if he is totally loved he is happy trust me i have relatives who were totally loved and all of the kids , all of them , are very successful would you rather have a very successful child who is constantly miserable ? a driven successful person lacks love , by definition otherwise he would not be driven just a few hints ask a child what he wants to eat at least once in a while help him make decisions about his life and what will make him happy where does want to go on sunday ? etc etc what college does he want to go to ? not the favorite of the parent , who can help , but he has to make the decision in other words , we ask kids , what will make you happy today ? if you think that would have been wonderful in your lifetime with your parents , then you know it is right for your kids it is not utopian it is possible now all it takes a little change and then watch the difference ah love i will add here a bit from another piece i wrote to make my point clearer we can tell the level of pain and its time frame by the kind of symptom or behavior that is apparent when something happens in the present it resonates with or sets off something earlier in that way anger that dips into the first line and becomes rage or fear becomes terror , feeling disappointed in the present becomes profound hopelessness on the deeper level in the same way when the first line is close we may go from a mild headache to a severe migraine it is not a different entity it is a continuum which makes each symptom deeper and more aggravated so there is some slight adversity in the present that resonates deeper down and the person goes for a xanax he is quelling first line , deep imprints quelling terror and hopelessness that goes along with the terror after all , if there is massive anesthetic at birth and the child cannot struggle to get born there is terror and hopelessness , and the beginnings of addiction of course the origin is mysterious and unknown it was immediately covered over by the gating system thus , each level accounts for something deeper and more damaging as resonance deeps down into our primal unconscious and triggers off inordinate behavior or symptoms first line events , therefore , represent out of control symptoms and behavior drug taking it forces us into over the top reactions as long as that bottom rung , the first line imprint is left dangling and not integrated there will always be the tendency to addiction it is that first line level that contributes to profound addiction and of course , until it is out of the way we will always be vulnerable to drinking or drug taking and too , it will shorten our lives there are those who say once an alcoholic or drug taker always one not true it seems so genetic but it is not it is epigenetic of which i have written a lot i have treated heavy drinkers and drug takers with success but only after arriving on the deepest levels of the brain a caveat they must be treated in house for some time before getting back out on the street
