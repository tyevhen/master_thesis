dear a b thank you so much for your book , depression is a choice your book helps me enormously i have written to you before a couple of times i think for the most part i have only experienced major depression once this was when i was i wrote to you a few years ago because i was feeling down about living in new york and having difficulty making friends and meeting a man for a long term relationship i'm writing to you now because i am in the throes of another problem i finished my masters in nursing in january and thought that i wanted to move from new york i blamed living in new york for my problems with meeting friends and a partner people constantly talk about how hard it is to meet people here since my sister had moved recently , i decided i would try where she lived i went on job interviews about weeks ago , i went for interviews i felt very anxious prior to going and went i got there , the anxiety intensified i have never felt so anxious i was offered the job but turned it down i felt so consumed with anxiety about moving and just really had no desire to move this put me into some kind of a tailspin my sister prescribed effexor i have never taken anti depressants but i just could not deal with the panic even though i am home , i am still panicking and waking up in the middle of the night , vomitting , etc when i am working i am working as a nurse , i am ok and last night i slept through the night with no panic however , i still feel shaky in the mornings i also wonder if my feelings about new york are validand i do need to leave or if that is just depression talking i am shaken from all of this i guess there are certain things i want in life and am not getting friends that i have are having children and moving on and so i feel the friendships i do have are dwindling also , i am and still have n't met a life partner do you have any advice for me ? i do n't want to self focus i really do want to just be a good person and make a difference but i also need community and relationships i have a big supportive family but they are mostly in nj and have children and their own lives one of my sisters moved to brazil and at met someone and is getting married she spent many years in new york single i guess this was a big incentive for me to move too please let me know if you have any suggestions thank you , t dear t , if i were you i would not take any drugs for anxiety if you are lacking in body nutrients that causes anxiety then go to a nutritionist or a doctor of chinese medicine to see what nutritional supplements or hormones you need it seems to me from your description that you are probably very angry that life is not going the way you want this is perfectly normal we all hate it when things are n't going the way we want but this emotion does set us up for depression and anxiety the chemical imbalance is caused by our own anxious thinking and can be cured by curbing our anxious thinking and choosing more productive thinking generally speaking , to rush all around until we find the right spot where our life is waiting for us is like chasing our own tail we get wound up and make no progress life is always right where we are that does not mean that if some opportunity arises at a distance a job , a group we want to join , etc , that we ca n't pick up and go there or even , if we have some desire to move to some other place on a whim we ca n't go for it or to go where friends and family are there already may make sense as well it makes sense to assess your opportunities and chose the best option in every city there are small groups of like minded people you seek them out through their interests church , book groups , dance groups , philosophical lecture groups , local choirs , hiking or biking clubs , or singing choruses you can join people met in starbucks all the time or barnes and noble you can volunteer for various groups and meet other volunteers many people meet over the internet these days i met two wonderful friends when i took a course in public speaking through toastmaster 's international which is in every town one of my friends met her life partner by signing up for dance lessons through your work as a nurse you should be meeting people where you work set your mind that every day is an opportunity if not today , then tomorrow do magical thinking rathing than anxious thinking you can get an idea of magical thinking exercises from my book brainswitch out of depression there may be some opportunities in chat rooms , i'm not too familiar with internet opportunities there are men who are also looking for someone but taking drugs because you do n't like how your life is going does not make any sense at all if you 're in a sushi bar , or waiting in line , start talking to strangers you never know and be sure and let everyone in your family know you are looking for someone a b curtiss
