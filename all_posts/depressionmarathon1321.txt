a visionary , that 's what she said visionary ? wow she was halfway through her next sentence before my brain could register the word , digest its meaning , and spit out my dumbfounded response i told her i was damn sure visionary was a word never before linked with my name it was hours later when i really understood the compliment i had been paid we had been talking about my business ideas , rehashing the previous week 's negative rehab services appointment , and reviewing my goals i was detailing how i needed to shape my goals to fit within my limits the limits forced upon me by this illness the visionary compliment landed here she explained visionary by saying that i was , certainly taking the road less traveled one of my favorite poems , by the way ! i am looking for something , a job , that fits , rather than contorting into something that will likely never fit she 's right i am on the less popular path that fact is i have been on this path for seven years aloud i said , i was placed on this path i did n't have a choice ! what her comment highlighted , however , is that now i am taking the less worn path i had n't realized i 'd been doing that ! when when did i start taking this path ? when did i stop fighting ? when did i start going with the punch rather than hitting depression back ? over time , something changed i changed maybe depression got to choose one path over another , but today i choose whether to take the given path or to sit resentfully and die it is with great gratitude and humility that i choose to move see you all in the clearing up ahead
