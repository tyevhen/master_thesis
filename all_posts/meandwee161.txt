howdy ! not too long ago , i put up some new work in the shop first up , are my multi media fine art prints i'm so excited and nervous to show these this is my first real time showing my fine arty side it 's a vulnerable feeling , but exhilarating too these were originally created in watercolor and pencil on high end winsor newton watercolor paper in a x size i created prints of them in an x size and a x size heirloom quality with fade proof inks for sale here many of you know that i'm originally from maine and i miss it very much though i'm not far away i'm very much inspired by nature 's moody colors there and by the beautiful shapes and tones of the landscape the majestic beauty of maine 's animals is not to be missed , so i like to highlight their shapes in silhouette there is a wealth of beautiful subject matter to be found along maine 's rocky coasts and inland in her forests and mountains it 's hard to decide what to paint ! you will see that my style is very sparse , using very limited compositions and simple color washes there 's a lot of wet on wet use of the paint where i soak the paper with water for minutes and then drop the color onto it i combine this with the contrast of thick pencil lines which gives the work a folk art vibe that i love these are great clustered together in a group for a family room , nursery , den , or office more are definitely coming ! and , here are my latest letterpress additions to the shop these designs surely must look familiar , but i 've reinvented them as long tea length notecards x inches this allows for more room for writing and they make a unique impression folded notecards are fine , but i wanted to try something different and more memorable i created one new design the sand dollar in a flat notecard format beachy and fun if you like that sort of thing ! you can find all the letterpress stationery here i hope you enjoyed the little peek at my latest work ! hugs to all ! save
