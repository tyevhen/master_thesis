for unschoolers , constant questioning quickly becomes the norm what i 've been thinking about today is the vast array of types pf question you run into there are many different people that ask questions about this lifestyle in many ways , but there definitely seem to be some trends in what feeling is behind the questions now , overgeneralizing is rarely a good idea , and that 's definitely what i'm doing , but most of the people who 've asked me about unschooling do seem to fit roughly into one of these categories ! p the hostile questioner are n't you ruining your life ? how will anyone ever hire you if you do n't go to school ? this person is instantly suspicious and disapproving for whatever reason , be it jealousy that they never had the option of learning and living more freely , they are determined not to believe in any alternatives to conventional schooling , and will do anything to disprove whatever you say their purpose is not to learn , but to devalue the lifestyle you 're living to invalidate it , and thus validate their own choices as the clearly right ones the well meaning yet ignorant questioner but what about socialization ? this individual is simply curious , and entirely uninformed , the questions asked being slightly annoying only because of how often you 've answered them before ! this person has n't usually thought through the questions at all , they 're just repeating things they 've heard before in regards to home and or unschoolers they really do want to know more , and just have n't really thought much about any type of education , other than school , before the confused questioner after having just explained unschooling so , is your mom a good teacher ? this person , no matter how many different ways you try to explain things , just is n't grasping the concept they 're not confrontational or anti unschooling in the slightest , they 're just either very set in their ways of seeing the world , so much so that nothing else even computes , or you just think in a way that 's too different from them , and ca n't explain things in a way that they 'll get the cautiously optimistic questioner so , you can get into university ? the idea strikes a chord with this person they kind of like it , but are n't quite sure they should , and are worried they 're missing something crucial this is one of the most rewarding scenarios for an unschooler who wants to share this philosophy with others this person is very likely to be helped by finding out about unschooling ! and , recently at the anarchist bookfair , i 've been exposed to another type of questioner i 'll call those who approach things this way the constructive questioner they 're coming from a place that 's already supportive of freedom , and their questions are intelligent and well thought out their desire is to learn , and build on the basic knowledge they have , not to tear down the idea i found that quite delightful , and really enjoyed the panel discussion i was a part of there this post does n't really have much of a point , i'm afraid it simply came about because of a few vague thoughts about ll the different types of questions i 've been asked about unschooling , and a desire to get back to posting more regularly ! so , what types of unschooling questions do you get asked ? do you enjoy educating people about unschooling , or do you find it frustrating annoying ? is there a certain mindset you come across sometimes in those asking questions that just makes your day ? peace ! idzie you might also like blame unschooling ! the frustration of being that unschooled person unschooling is forever part isolation , socialization , and doubters unschooling are we teaching ourselves ? linkwithin
