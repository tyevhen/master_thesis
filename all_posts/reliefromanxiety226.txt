'i'm a celebrity' has recently returned for it 's thirteenth series and as much as i love the programme , this year has brought something new to my attention i thought i would write a quick post about it if you do n't like' i'm a celebrity' , just hold on for a bit as i promise there is a moral to all of this ! the programme has shown me just how different people can be from first impressions , or long held impressions for that matter and relates to my phobia post the notion that the people we perceive as perfect such as celebrities , highly powered people and even the people we come into contact every day all have fears , has been reinforced we may never know what these fears are , but i'm assured that everyone has them i often watch a programme called the wright stuff it 's a talk show focusing on the news of the day and includes debates on current affairs the host really surprised me as he is always composed , appears confident and often has intelligent input into the debates whilst watching the first episode of the series , it showed me that the people you do n't think have any problems , do ! he was extremely scared of creepy crawlies to the result of panic it really surprised me because of my long held impression of him as a talk show host it reinforces my thoughts that even celebrities and high powered people who seem perfect , do have their fears they all just have different triggers and some of them we will never see the reaction to it made me feel not as alone on this journey ! best wishes , amy xx
