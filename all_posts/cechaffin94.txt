aw this is terrible i'm four days behind in posting my daily poem for national poetry month , though i have kept up with the writing elsewhere so without further ado , and in order , the poems of april to april below day after gardening young sinatra 's on the cd i ca n't think of a contrast more extreme than his silky tenor and the rude jays one for my baby and one more for the road i play the music low because my love is deaf that way she can catch my sound to go with my moving lips when i sing along for her last night we spooned with my hand on her mons and i swelled and craved yet when i flexed my knees my legs cramped and awkwardly with hand in place i had to stretch , moving the dog off the bed you can guess what did n't happen day of book trees do not pick a green book , the print is faint and there 's often no ending they also lack that smell of organic paper and glue and fail to develop the proper musk paperbacks mature more quickly but are usually known cultivars and lack the vigor of hybrids that hardbacks display still , where the soil is poor or shade diminishes the literary vigor of the tree , occasionally a masterpiece may appear these are usually grafted onto hardback stock as soon as possible beware a brown book , usually overwritten or overripe , stultifying reams of overexplanation and overelaboration as in how many paradoxes can fit on the head of a heading but you might find henry james there or the critical prose of eliot , so a discriminating taste in aged books should be cultivated not all the fruit is too dry for the tongue and eye a red book should be picked immediately bright red has the genius of youth , crimson the wisdom of age size has little to do with taste , though perhaps more filling as in tolstoy vs kundera shakespeare and dante and homer come in gold and are common , having been cultivated for centuries the bible is black but remember , licorice is bitter then sweet like the scroll jeremiah ate poetry trees are rare and do best in high desert climates the value of the desert cannot be overemphasized overwatering these trees may lead to self indulgence and plush soil yields verse like overstuffed victorian chairs and you find yourself wading through syrup for a kernel of nutrition planted in unforgiving soil , these trees take care of themselves or not most die before they fruit , it 's true , but the few who flourish are prized beyond all other books and seldom go stale no other books take so long to mature just like the cone of a bristlecone pine for sheer volume pun intended pulp trees have no peer and can produce more fruit than any other though as in a chinese meal you may be hungry afterwards they are easy and fun to grow and truth be told , everyone likes them the rules for nonfiction trees are simple lots of room and lots of light space them too close together and they share the same opinion allow for too much shade and the research is n't up to par it takes a gift to raise trees for children the fruit is magical and monitored by the fda for obvious reasons to farm successfully you must begin with the concept of no tree at all , then imagine a tree as if you were a tree yourself if you ca n't understand these preparations , do n't bother reference trees are orderly as beech forests , their tall smooth boles spaced widely , an air of gravity in the light that floods the oblong leaves silence and history walk there and look ! there is my book about survival in the desert yes , a book of poetry but is it ripe ? day ars thusia if i could get every pound of flesh , the whole whale 's heart of blubbering humanity out there on the operating table , if every swallow in my cortex were crucified on the windshield , if every cardinal bled brightly under the lights , the heron choking on an oximeter , if all my words were compressed from a superfluity of glottal tides into one book , one slim text beneath the latex gloves in open dissection , if all you hear or could not hear were wrapped in synthetic grape leaves the color of lemon as an antiseptic precaution before the exploratory , and if the world came to witness the miracle of emergence , this pecking at the dragon shell of art from both sides until black accordion wings unfold and fire forks forth , then would it have been worth it , would it have been worth it all , without the vinegar or gall to offer up our organs in a dying fall ? day dream of the ex last night i dreamed of my ex wife of years ago again , the queen of chaos , obese articulator of logorrhea , spokeswoman for all that is tangential , forgettable , spewing cheap chocolates from the whitman 's sampler of her mind 's crowded trailer park , her laugh like a donkey 's bray sometimes followed by a snort before the c section and third child she had big tits and a nice ass and sex was good , you know , physically , but afterwards she took to fat quite naturally , sure as she made our new car smell of french fries when i warned her not to let the kids eat in it but they were hungry ! she 'd say , as if that made ketchup on velor excusable in the dream i tried to reach my second daughter but the ex kept telling me the phone wo n't work unless i registered my credit card somehow , she could n't explain it , then she could never explain anything meanwhile i kept dialing while something about jeans in addition to alimony rattled out , and the plumbing , and jeopardy she could talk to a wall , she could talk to a rock , lack of sentience was no bar to her apostrophes five bedrooms she had now , a brand new rental before the coming spaghetti stains , wall gouges , roaches , ants , weevils and clean and unclean wash in one pile the pyramid of mystery clothes as a doctor i had lots of time , of course , to do my own wash , which i did these dreams where i splinter with nowhere to hang the hat of my being , being dispersed like pollen while the familiar but frightening tractor flays the furrows of silence with its noise and constant upheavals as in no dead air time on this station of a constantly narrated life like hers clearly i never worked through the damage instead ran like joseph , sundering time and place from memory where i quarantined the contagion of a house where nothing was ever in the same place twice , where you could n't walk barefoot for fear of sticky quantums , leading to a basic mistrust of carpet and other phobias we were good at sex but it was n't worth the price if years later i wake up anxious and lost though i did up my medications if you muddled through all those rough drafts you deserve a medal , so here feel better ? the last poem about the dream really scared me i hate when that happens at kiloneutral , ce
