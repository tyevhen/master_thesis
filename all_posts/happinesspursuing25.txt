i am constantly and deeply touched by the thoughtful comments and emails that you send my way frankly , i think that this blog should be no more than annoying to anyone who doesn t live inside my head so , when you read it and give it enough thought to respond with advice or words of encouragement , i m filled with gratitude although i read every response , i rarely reply most of the time there s nothing to say i ve said my bit you said yours and we move on i hope that you re not offended or distressed by this anyway , that s all i had to say this time around after that post i published last night , i popped on to check my email i had a surprising number of emails and post comments so i thought that a blanket statement would be apropos thanks , everyone , for caring and i wish you all the very best on each of your journeys and now this blog will return to its regular programming coming up more whining , self loathing and avoiding the obvious stay tuned !
