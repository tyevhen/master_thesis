things are going fairly well here lately life is stable i'm feeling okay i 'd like to feel better than okay , but that 's not yet my reality i'm definitely still feeling better and functioning better than last month , but i think i'm a little flat i feel dulled , if that makes any sense it 's probably hyper critical of me to be complaining about feeling flat and i do n't mean to complain i am grateful last month 's week depression dip was arrested when it was i am doing well , especially when compared to that time i guess i'm just not back to yet , and i 've been hanging out here for about weeks now my mood is good , but not great my energy is improved , but not normal i'm getting things done , but not everything i'm functioning at work , but i could be doing better i 've put in the work , scaled the rock face , and i'm approaching the summit i'm hanging on the precipice , but i ca n't quite boost myself up the last few feet it 's there i can see it but it 's out of reach i'm just shy of feeling normal it 's strange feeling this way i do n't remember having this issue in the past flat and again , i feel a little ashamed to even mention it i know things could be so , so much worse ! i'm talking with my doctor , we 're tinkering with my meds , and i'm continuing to put one foot in front of the other i'm moving forward i 'll try to quit worrying about feeling flat focusing forward and remembering to maintain an attitude of gratitude is what i think i need to do now after all , i have many blessings in my life today i'm glad to be functioning well , and i'm happy my mood has rebounded feeling okay is better than not okay any day of the week i 'll keep taking the actions i can take hopefully the rest will follow
