dear a b curtiss just wanted to drop you a note and say thank you for writing depression is a choice my family has a history of depression my grandfather struggled all his life with depression , even had electric shock therapy , and eventually committed suicide in his 's , my uncle was also manic depressive , and my mother started manifesting depression after her kids grew up , she has been in a cycle ofdepression normalcy for the last years or so when mom was in the midst of one of her depressive seasons , i happened across your book in the bookstore and have read it twice your personal insight was and is refreshing and extremely helpful thanks again for writing the book ! j dear j you are welcome if you have any questions do n't hesitate to write and you might also find brainswitch out of depression helpful if i could describe the difference between the two books depression is a choice is the philosophy of how you get out of depression , brainswitch out of depression is a little more how to and user friendly , more the neuroscience of how you get out of depression a b curtiss
