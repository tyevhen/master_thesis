today i held a sprig of a pine tree in my hand it had been cut away from a tree , though i do n't know how long ago i looked at the small piece i held in my hand , it looked nice and green just like you would expect i wanted to smell the fragrance of this bit of branch with its pine needles i held it to my nose and sniffed i smelled nothing what is wrong with this bit of tree , i thought i sniffed again , and still nothing then , i heard a voice in the room say , if it is crushed or broken , its fragrance will come out i took the sprig and bent its needles between my fingers sure enough , i could smell slightly the fragrance that came from within the more that i bent its needles and crushed it in my hand , the stronger its true fragrance emanated from the inner core the sprig did n't look quite as perfect as it had been at first , untouched , with each needle in place i smelled the sprig that was now partly bent and broken the more i smelled it , the more i noticed something that i had not been there before a pleasant sweetness lingered in the air the sprig did not have the rough , harsh smell i had remembered from other trees because of the fragrance that came from being crushed and broken , the beauty of the sprig of tree extended further that it could before and brought a comforted smile to my face i too have been crushed and broken in the beginning i thought that everything in my life was ok and in order i went along like everybody else then mental illness came crushing into my life the pain and struggle broke me i did n't think i could be anything of worth any longer i wanted to die time continued to go by , and i still lived going through the brokenness , a new strength arose within me from being crushed and continuing on , i started to see beauty that healing brings maybe i was and am crushed and broken so that the true , sweet fragrance of the life i choose to live can emanate from the inner core of who i am maybe my life can become a fragrance that can be taken in by others and become something beautiful being crushed and broken could be worth it after all cindy
