the last nba playoff team to advance has been determined the atlanta hawks cleveland should beat them four games to one the second round begins today with dallas vs denver this is a hard one to call , but based on superior inside strength i think denver should be favored to move on and meet the lakers , who should beat houston in six in the east , contrary to most expectations , i think boston will handle orlando in six or seven and go on to be beaten by cleveland in a tough series despite the loss of kevin garnett , they are still the champions , and under pressure they play like it it 's a gray day here on the mendocino coast , post rain it 's great that we got our garden in during a sunny spell and that now it is getting a thorough watering from nature i ca n't wait for our flowers to mature many have started blooming it gives me joy to stare out to the oceean over the colors of our garden i actually beat my wife and editor tonight at scrabble that was a feat i can get fat on oh , and she called me fat today like i did n't know it i immediately comforted myself with extreme nachos actually i ate a salad salads are n't bad if you put enough croutons and nuts on them to get some real calories up the pipe yes , i need a diet no , i'm not smoking but do i have a poem ? poems divide my readership to a certain extent the literary folks read them while the mood disordered folks sort of gloss over them , with the natural exception of mood disordered literary types oh , there 's a new review out on my book at the pedestal , a fine venue with an insightful reviewer who really gets the dark side of unexpected light here 's a recent poem the stranger this morning i wept for no reason i 've been pushing back the terror like a stage curtain , one arm holding back the darkness , all that muffled noise of sets being moved , sets for my future when i do n't want the present changed i wonder if my understudy will look like me , act like me , suffer like me of course not , he has his own life but is n't it my life , too ? computers have a trash bin for every stump of a poem we tried to save although our grafts would never take but just to keep on writing , holding the curtain at arm 's length , is this not a life terrorized ? should n't i welcome the stranger , who comes robed in the future , equally prepared for sadness or joy ? perhaps at every moment of awakening we generate a ghost , a dark companion to drag the hero down to where the dragon sits , whom we must overcome by being still to fight would only seed another monster the one in the mirror is quite enough all for tonight at kilobunny , ce
