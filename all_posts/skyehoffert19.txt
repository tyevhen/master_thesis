so i have been missing these the last few months , but starting sparks is an awesome linkup hosted by emily and ashley they are both wonderful bloggers , so go check them out do join up if you get the chance , it goes till the end of the month the destructive tinkling of shattered glass on marble floor , followed a slammed door william ! that better not have been the good teacups i yelled his silence was more than an answer i banged on the door , is n't there a better way to deal with your anger , than by smashing things if there is i have yet to find one he shouted it 's childish i sighed , as if i could expect more from him his answer was more smashing is this necessary ! i shouted , banging on the wood door absolutely , his sardonic tone though muffled still rang through really i huffed , opening the door that he had failed to lock he looked at me in disgust , his eyes rimmed red not with tears of course that was too much to expect , but from whatever alcoholic beverage he was drinking down i put my hand on my hip and stood in silence until he was forced to acknowledge my presence he pulled the bottle from his lips with an eyeroll what ? i sneered , you could at least use a glass he plopped into a chair , and gestured at the floor , i 've broken them yes , i know , why i was trying my best to be calm and rational , one of us needed to keep our heads and it was n't going to be him i rather not discuss why he said dipping his head back for another drink i shook my head , no , no you are not going to do this to me again i launched myself at him , and grabbed the bottle he tried to snatch it back , even resorted to pulling my hair , but i untangled myself and fled to the other side of the room tripping on glass shards on the way he looked wretched as he glared at me your cruel i held out the bottle and sniffed it , rum i only want you to talk to me , why do you never talk to me he shook his finger at me , no not you anyone but you why not i said , the playfulness fell from my words he turned back to the scarred table , because you are the last person i want to see i tried to keep the pain out of my expression oh i almost dropped the bottle , well i guess i will leave you to it then he inhaled sharply , that 's not what i meant i mean i do n't want you to see me he raked a hand through his hair , seeming to find speaking and eye contact difficult like this he whispered gesturing to himself , glancing at me only to confirm my presence vulnerable , broken , weak he slammed his fist down punctuating his last words i inched closer , why ? his gaze met mine , i just said no i mean why his face screwed up in confusion it was a good look for him why do n't you want me to see you i tilted my head at him , you look the same to me it was n't the response he was expecting , a small smile teased at the corner of his mouth he still seemed unsure , there is just so much i know , and it 's okay i stood only a foot away now , it 's okay to be those things i brushed off the top of the bottle with my sleeve in fact your more human now , then i have ever seen you i took a small sip he watched me curiously , something flickered in his eyes he stood up , and closed the gap between us really , he said with a devilish grin , smiling down at me like the proper rogue that he was i stepped closer , our noses were almost touching , yes , i hissed , still every bit a cad his hand grazed mine as he unceremoniously ripped the bottle from my hands , and clumped back to his chair he raised the bottle in my direction , and you are nothing like the desperate damsel i asked for i raised my invisible glass in turn and we toasted that was how we spent the evening on opposite ends of the long table , with both of us making a point ignoring the shattered glass i think they need marriage counseling personally , but they seem to be okay
