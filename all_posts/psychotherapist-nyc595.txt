i just read a recent article by kim olver called ten ways to keep him from cheating on psych central 's your tango column which , in my opinion , gives women the wrong message about relationships ms olver gives suggestions to help a woman prevent her man from cheating the article gives the impression that ms olver thinks it 's the woman 's responsibility to try to keep her man from cheating really ? are women responsible for trying to keep their partners from cheating ? can we ever control another person 's behavior ? as a psychotherapist who has worked with many individual adults and couples on the issue of infidelity , i believe that the responsibility for cheating lies with the individual who cheated not with the spouse or partner who is being cheated on when i work with clients on this issue , no matter what reasons the person who cheated gives , whether s he blames the partner or gives some other reason , my position is that it 's essential for the person who cheated to take responsibility for his or her own actions if the person who cheated tries to justify the cheating by giving reasons that were stated in ms olver 's article , like i was bored or she was nagging me too much or i felt like i was disappointing her too much , so i wanted to be with someone who is new and excited about me , that 's not taking responsibility that 's making excuses it 's an immature response , and if the person who cheated does n't get beyond that , it usually does n't bode well for the relationship this advice reminds me of a popular song by burt bachrach and h david called wives and lovers part of the words to this song , say hey , little girl , comb your hair , fix your make up , soon he will open the door , do n't think because there 's a ring on your finger , you need n't try any more for wives should always be lovers too , run to his arms the moment that he comes home to you i'm warning you , day after day , there are girls at the office and the men will always be men , do n't stand him up , with your hair still in curlers , you may not see him again while this might have been accepted advice among popular songwriters and cosmopolitan magazine in , women have come a long way since that time many more women today recognize that they do n't have to be with a man that they think will find reasons to cheat this also reminds me of a time when a client , who got a dwi , said , it was n't my fault after all , i'm an alcoholic that reason certainly was n't accepted by the police officer who arrested him , and i did n't accept that as an excuse for his behavior although he was a person who had alcohol problems , he was still responsible for his behavior , and taking responsibility was , eventually , a big part of his being able to stay sober just like certain baseball uniform numbers are retired , i 'd like this notion that women are responsible for keeping their men from cheating retired once and for all what do you think ? i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hynotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist i work with individual adults and couples to find out more about me , visit my web site josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at
