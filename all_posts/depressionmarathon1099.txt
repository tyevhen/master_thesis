today is my anniversary it 's been three years since i took my last drink more importantly , it 's been three years since i realized i could no longer quit drinking on my own i needed help , and i found it in the rooms of aa i was the most unlikely candidate to get sober using the twelve steps , as i did n't believe in them powerlessness , god , unmanageability , making amends it was all crap as far as i was concerned typing that last sentence made me laugh , and if you got sober in aa , i bet you 're chuckling , too ! i did n't want to accept i was an alcoholic like so many newcomers , i figured i was unique i thought my education , intelligence and willpower somehow protected me i was the exception to all their rules even if i was an alcoholic , i thought , i could figure things out and get sober alone i'm laughing again ! in the last three years , i ca n't count the number of times i 've heard those exact thoughts from newbies crossing aa 's threshold i was n't even close to being unique ! ultimately , not being unique saved my life just as no one understands depression better than another with depression , nobody gets alcoholism better than another alcoholic the secrets of a drinking life can only be honestly shared with others who 've struggled the same struggles , thought the same thoughts , and endured the same experiences different , i was not i came in seeing only differences rooms initially filled with people who were nothing like me became rooms of brothers , sisters , confidants and mentors the people in the rooms did n't change i did they did n't have to change i did once i sat down , listened , and got out of my own way a process which took about a year i felt a new happiness and a new freedom i began to recover life is not all sunshine and roses , as any regular reader of this blog knows , but it is different recovery makes it different aa may not be for everyone , but without it , i know i would n't have recovered from my alcoholism i am alive today because of the family i found in the rooms of aa i am living today because i stopped treating my depression with alcohol and started treating it with antidepressants with alcohol , suicide was all but certain with antidepressants at least i have a fighting chance i am more hopeful , more honest , and a lot happier today because i do my best to practice the twelve steps in all my affairs through the generosity , compassion and understanding of my friends in aa , i have a new life today a life i never imagined just three years ago and for that , i am so very grateful
