there 's a common myth that one of the main reasons enterprise customers get locked in to a particular vendor 's technology is the huge investment of time and money that goes into specifying , procuring , rolling out , and maintaining a large system i was talking to a financial analyst the other day about this very phenomenon the name of a well known cms vendor came up my financial analyst friend somewhat new to the software biz asked whether the huge cost of rolling out , training for , and maintaining a large system did n't pose an enormous disincentive for customers considering moving to another system i said no , that 's a myth that 's the amazing thing about this business , i said people walk away from million dollar systems all the time it 's not hard to understand if an expensive system is draining you dry , you have to stop the bleeding sometimes the best way to do that is to stop throwing money at a bad solution and move on but how do you walk away from an investment of x million dollars ? my financial analyst friend wanted to know first of all , understand that capital expenditures are depreciated over time from an accounting point of view , investments in software are walked away from routinely it 's a given the real question is n't whether you can afford to write off a bad investment , but what it will cost in current dollars to move to a new system the impediments to moving to a new system can be many , but typically , lock in occurs because data is interred in proprietary formats making migration to a new system costly , or because large amounts of custom written application code will need to be ported at great cost to the new system or both data lock in happens in funny ways you can have all your content in standard industry formats xml , jpg , pdf and still be locked into a content management system very tightly by virtue of the system 's metadata mappings or database schemas , or by virtue of the system 's use of a template structure or dynamic page language that 's proprietary the existence of large amounts of custom written application code is also a serious problem it may not even be possible even in theory to port code from the old system to a new one , if the apis and abstraction levels are far enough apart you may well end up having to rewrite some or all of your custom apps from scratch and that can get very expensive very quickly in sum the high cost of data and code migration remain serious impediments to moving off of existing systems which presents an opportunity , of sorts , for vendors if you 're a vendor and you want to convince someone to buy a new system , make it attractive for them to move off their old system at a bare minimum provide good data migration utilities take the pain out of migration since customers will be rewriting and or walking away from large amounts of legacy code , provide rapid application development tools including powerful code libraries and easy to learn apis that enable new customers to put custom apps together quickly this is a hugely important topic that deserves much more attention than i can give it here give customers a licensing option that does n't lead to high first year costs offer a pay as you go option customers do n't like to write large checks in year one make your software less hardware intensive than the incumbent 's , so that your customer can get by on fewer cpus , less ram , less disk storage , etc if you can save your customer a few hardware budget dollars , he or she may be more likely to reallocate some of those dollars to software make the administration experience easy if you can prove that your system entails less administrative burden and you can document the cost savings in terms of headcount reduction , it can help make the case for moving to a new system one thing is certain now is not the time to be selling big , old fashioned middleware systems the old fashioned way people are n't willing or able , in this economy to spend a million dollars to be vendor locked to a solution that 's hard to migrate data and applications into or out of as i said last october , the days of the million dollar white elephant are drawing to a close after this recession is over , there will be fewer species than before i think we all know that
