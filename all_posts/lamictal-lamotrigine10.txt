it was last year at this time that things started to get really bad i felt ok during the sunny days , had low energy during the cloudy days once it hit pm though then the thoughts started coming they went something like this there 's not enough light in the house there 's not enough light in the universe ! but if i turn on all the lights in the house , i can keep it from tipping into the darkness so darkness somehow weighs more than light ? that does n't make any sense how can darkness weigh anything ? it does n't it just does n't on the other hand i the dark , cavernous maw in the other room is sort of bugging me all right , i 'll humor myself , i 'll turn on every damn light in the house and then , as the weeks wore on
