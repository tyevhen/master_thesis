for the second saturday in a row , i ran a race this race was miles long it 's an annual event held on a paved bike trail which runs through the woods northwest of town it 's a very laid back race , and only about people ran despite the perfect , sunny and cool weather conditions i run this race every year , even though i always find myself questioning that decision somewhere around mile nine every year this year was no exception i was feeling quite cooked by mile nine and cursing myself for running yet again despite that , i did have a decent race i ran entirely by feel i did n't look at my watch once i wore one , because i like to see my mile splits after the fact , but i wanted to run without worrying about pace unfortunately , i had some uncomfortable gi distress , which kept my anxiety up until i finally took a quick pit stop around mile four after that i was able to focus all of my anxiety on the discomfort of running an out and back mile race ! that was a joke this is what i looked like about one half mile prior to the finish i definitely look a lot better than i felt ! i was totally ready to be done ! i ended up finishing second overall , and first of only two women in my age division , in a time of i'm okay with that i did n't take any easy or rest days prior to the race , and i'm in the middle weeks of my marathon training , so is a decent time i'm sure i could run faster , but i guess i 'll have to wait until next year to prove that next year yup , i'm sure i 'll go back
