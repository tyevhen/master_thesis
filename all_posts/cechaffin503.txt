as i recently had a brush with the law , imagine my surprise when i heard a rapping on my front door , which irritated me , as the importunate individual didn t come in when i shouted , come in ! instead i was forced to unwind my creaky and overweight body from its easy chair to let the visitor in and right now it isn t easy to rise when i push on the arms of my chair to lift myself up , sparing my back , the bursitis in my right shoulder makes it a molar grinding proposition did i mention the knock came from a detective ? he was in uniform , perhaps because he was from the county sheriff s office he was tall , dark , and italian , with eyes of blue topaz rarely do i comment on a man s appearance but i m glad kathleen wasn t home to see him i already hear too much about liam neeson i do wish he had worn a suit i mean , there s a reason they call detectives suits , isn t there ? my whole television world , my false comfort in phony stereotypes , was shattered , to say the least then there is something about a man in uniform verily , about which matter did said authority inquire ? detective ricky del fiorentino laid out a pile of photos and asked me if i d seen any of the furnishings displayed in them at my neighbor s house err that would have been a yes there was a woman in the photos who claimed to be our neighbors former landlord she alleged they had skipped out not only without paying the rent , but with some souvenirs as the woman was square faced and frumpy looking , i thought her a more convincing witness than my neighbors , who claimed to be from malibu , and said recently , when mel gibson had his trouble , serves him right everybody in malibu knew he was a phony they dress very la as well , which stands out in the redwoods i didn t want to make a positive identification without kathleen consenting as there was no way to insure anonymity i also wanted her moral input i hate handing anyone over to the authorities as i have a healthy distaste for our system of needless incarceration , i mean justice but if this other woman was telling the truth , i should probably come clean best to wait for kathleen having only recently been severely depressed and still feeling fragile , i feel the need at present to consult kathleen about nearly everything she s a fount of knowledge , truly i only hope my dependence isn t a turn off women want men to confide in them while acting as if they don t need to kathleen came home and was certain that the right thing to do was to drop the dime , but i didn t feel good about it on the other hand , if our neighbors go upstate for grand larceny , n will quit cutting my swiss chard without permission kathleen and i haven t even tasted it yet it 's not that s and n are good friends , by any means , but they are pleasant acquaintances , and once in a while we 'd have a laugh on the other hand , they were likely in possession of up to , of stolen goods worse , n had hornswaggled kathleen in trying to sell things for her on e bay , promising to split the profits she was trying to make kathleen her unwitting fence ! i grew up in the s and hate to turn anyone over to the oppressors , i mean authorities but kathleen and i both thought it was the right thing to do no doubt our grifter friends will shimmy their way out of it all i know is that no arrest has been made yet today about eighteen hours after the fact then the officer was trying to get a warrant on a late friday afternoon , and prosecutors have lives , too although we are friendly with s and n we are not invested in them i told kathleen from the outset that they were scammers , sociopaths they were living under the radar , paying cash for everything except things you can t get with cash , as when they importuned us to use our debit card to order cable for them incidentally , they watch television hrs a day it is unapologetically the most important thing in their lives why should they go to jail when they re already in it ? in jail they will certainly read more it could be good for them so it s a win win the lady will get her antiques back our neighbors will begin a reading program and my vegetable garden will not be abused is there a poem in my oeuvres that can possibly relate to this tale ? i found one that was later combined with others into my poem , drug trial tolerance to stand for something , to protest abortion or the destruction of wetlands , to support the preservation of historic buildings or the return of condors to the wild fulfills our passion for goodness more than tolerance , an mere exercise in manners , not even a virtue , more like ignoring someone s body odor in an elevator who can say with a straight face , i understand and accept what you are doing even though i find it detestable ? moral passion is not an oxymoron i d still rate myself as rodent neutral , but there s also a prickling in my gut that tells me i m not far from the abyss thine in truth and art , c e chaffin
