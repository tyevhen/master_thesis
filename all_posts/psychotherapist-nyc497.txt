developing a romantic relationship on a solid foundation when the feelings have developed over time and they 're mutual , it has the potential to be a wonderful experience since you already know each other so well , your romantic relationship can build on a solid foundation if you 're best friends , you already know each other 's likes , dislikes , interests and opinions about important issues , like views on families , spirituality , finances , and so on if it 's a long term friendship , you 've probably been there for each other during hard times , which is an important element in a romantic relationship you probably also have other friends in common developing a romantic relationship as an extension of your friendship your relationship started as a friendship , and then a romantic spark might have developed between the two of you over time as you got to know each other better this tends to be a more stable way of developing a relationship than love at first sight , although love at first sight works for many couples too it 's just that when the experience is love at first sight , the romantic chemistry is n't always enough to build a relationship on love at first sight is often an unconscious process and , although it can be exhilarating , it 's only a first step whereas a romantic relationship that started as a friendship usually has more substance what are the potential negative aspects of falling in love with your best friend ?
