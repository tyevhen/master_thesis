the idea is to remain in the feeling zone , the only zone where connection can take place outside of the primal zone , no integration is possible this is why it helps for the therapist to have at least a modicum of brain science at his disposal in some cases , for example , we know that the use of tranquilizers can help get the patient into the zone for a time this is not in lieu of therapy but as an aid to it now why is the wrong feeling addressed ? because when a therapist has unresolved feelings of her own she will tend to drive the patient where she needs to go or worse , she will avoid feelings of the patient that she is not ready for as for example , anger if the therapist is terrified of hostility , she will shut it down in the patient she won t let the patient go near it , and the feeling will remain unresolved if the therapist cannot be criticized , she will dodge any blame and try to make any error the patient s fault instead of hers this is the most widespread of problems with therapists above all , we want to avoid confining the patient to his ideational cortex to the neglect of feeling in other words , we want to avoid precisely the predominant therapeutic approach in contemporary psychotherapy , which is cognitive behavioral the cognitivists really do believe it s all in your head , that changing thoughts can change behavior to me , ideas signify something disembodied when a therapist lives in the world of ideas there won t be much feeling there one reason is that feelings seem secondary to them ideas , they agree , are paramount and have value by contrast , a full , feeling experience in the primal sense means that that we are not confined to the neocortical level where ideas and intellect live what we are after is to hook up the primitive , lower levels of the brain with higher levels so that there is a proper connection this means that the historical need feeling pain has been fully experienced with all of our being and how do we know when a real feeling has taken place ? we can verify it , physiologically before and after every session , we systematically measure vital signs of each patient during a real primal , we expect to the vital signs move pretty much together up at the start and back down towards the end of a session over months there is a constant normalization of vital signs so that the blood pressure , heart rate and body temp get reset to the normal range after some months of therapy over time , there is also a significant drop in cortisol levels and enhanced natural killer cells see my book primal healing for further discussion measurable metabolic changes also include a permanent one degree lowering of body temperature since body temperature is a key factor in our longevity and the work of our bodies , it is an important index in addition , our research found that after one year of our therapy there were systematic changes in brain function toward a more harmonized cerebral system it all means that we are getting to the pain and undoing repression that is not the case with abreaction in a feeling without context , which is an abreaction , there is never this kind of organized , coordinated movement of vital functions instead , a random discharge of energy from the feeling pain will produce a sporadic , disorganized movement of vital signs there is no harmony to the system thus , when vital signs do not reflect integration , we can be sure that connection never took place by these measures , thinking that we feel and actually having a real feeling are neurologic worlds apart excuse me for jumping between the masculine and feminine pronouns , using him and he interchangeable with her and she i get very tired of trying to balance he and she , so be aware that my heart and mind are in the right place
