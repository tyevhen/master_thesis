just a short post today , as i am just getting ready to leave for duluth and grandma 's marathon the car is packed i brought way too much stuff puck is on his way to bill and cindy 's house , otherwise known as the doggy spa he gets spoiled rotten there i'm anxious to get the show on the road i have no idea what saturday will bring for me my training has been slow and tough lately i feel heavy and sluggish it 's not exactly an ideal way to feel approaching a marathon i was hoping to shoot for a fast time , but i 've scaled back my goals now my new goal is we 'll see what happens i 'll probably start the race at the slightly faster pace of which i originally planned however , i now lack the confidence that i 'll be able to hold that pace over the later miles that 's the beauty of the marathon , though you just never know how it 's going to turn out success depends on so many different variables when tackling miles it 's always unpredictable , but usually interesting we 'll see what happens and now i'm off to begin the journey i 'll let you know how it turns out
