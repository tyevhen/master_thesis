the other day i did something i swore i 'd never do i paid to elsevier for a copy of a scientific paper i spent a good minutes looking for a free version of the paper online first , of course , using every sneaky trick i know then i debated with myself for minutes , saying things like you are not seriously going to pay those crooks , are you ? and answering no , of course not but you have to i know so do it i ca n't i 'd rather set my face on fire and on and on after an hour i realized , of course , that the time i 'd wasted not buying the paper had been worth much more than the paper itself so i bought the paper just this once the article in question is called stopping the active intervention caret , by bowen et al , controlled clinical trials as you might have guessed , i'm going to spend the rest of today 's blog talking about it so you do n't have to buy it yourself the paper i bought talks about the circumstances surrounding the halting of an infamous cancer prevention study called caret , otherwise known as the carotene and retinol efficacy trial it was a large national cancer institute trial that did n't go well caret was actually one of two large nci vitamin studies that did n't go well in the s the other was the alpha tocopherol and beta carotene atbc lung cancer prevention study caret was carried out in the u s atbc took place in finland i'm not going to spend a lot of time talking about the studies here for that , see my latest blog on this subject at big think suffice it to say that both studies began enrolling participants in , the finns at a rate of about , a year , the americans at , a year the atbc study reached its enrollment goal of just under , people in three years caret went on enrolling for nine years , peaking at , people in september it 's customary in large trials to enroll people gradually not just for practical reasons it 's infeasible to sign up , people at once but also because if a treatment proves to be deadly , you want to be able to halt the study before huge numbers of people have been put at risk sadly , both atbc and caret put large groups at risk both should have been stopped prematurely only caret was and its halting came unnecessarily late the purpose of atbc and caret was to validate the usefulness of antioxidant supplements vitamins a and e , chiefly as cancer preventive agents for atbc , the study population consisted of male finnish smokers aged to for caret it was current and former smokers , male and female , aged to , plus asbestos exposed workers all men aged to the asbestos workers made up of the , study participants the experimental design in finland was a x matrix design in which a quarter of the participants got mg day of beta carotene , a quarter got mg day of alpha tocopherol vitamin e , a quarter got both , and a quarter got placebo thus , treatment groups outnumbered placebo in the u s , caret began with a x design but the design was changed early on so that the bulk of the study population got either placebo or a combo of mg day beta carotene and , iu of retinol per day thus a ratio of treated to untreated populations according to the atbc writeup that eventually appeared in the journal of the national cancer institute , an independent data and safety monitoring board convened twice annually to monitor trial progress and to study unblinded data that were relevant to intervention safety and efficacy which makes it all the harder to understand why the atbc trial was n't halted early when the beta carotene groups separated from placebo in the wrong direction it was evident in year of the eight year study that people in the treatment group were developing lung cancer at a heightened rate in fact , that ended up being the key finding of the study taking vitamin e and beta carotene leads to more cancer presumably , the finns did n't halt their intervention early for the simple reason that the study 's stopping criterion whatever it happened to be all large studies have them was n't met perhaps the divergence of treated and untreated group performance was deemed statistically non significant we 'll never know for sure the atbc results appeared in the april , issue of the new england journal of medicine in stopping the active intervention caret from elsevier , we learn from the lead investigator and his coauthors on march , , the nci directed investigators of nci funded randomized trials involving beta carotene to inform their data and safety monitoring boards of the atbc trial findings , to review their data in light of these findings and to develop plans to inform their participants of the atbc results and incorporate the findings in their consent forms this is an interesting statement in a couple of ways first , it does n't say exactly who at nci directed investigators to review their data the implication is that somebody higher up than the lead investigator gave an order whoever that person was , he or she knew the unblinded finnish results ahead of publication secondly , it says safety boards were directed to review their data but in the caret study unlike atbc , the safety board did not have access to unblinded data how can you review data that 's still blinded ? and if you did so , what purpose would it serve ? you 'd look at the data and see that one group of people , under one set of codes , was doing worse than another group under another set of codes you might very reasonably assume that the group doing worse was the placebo group but you would n't know for sure this is where it gets interesting , because in stopping the active intervention caret from elsevier we learn that on march and april , caret s principal investigator convened telephone conference calls with the semc during which the committee was unblinded to intervention group assignment note the phrase the committee was unblinded in actuality , there was no unblinding over the phone in a separate writeup in data monitoring in clinical trials a case studies approach springer , , page , former caret safety committee members anthony b miller , julie buring , and o dale williams explain that in august four months after the phone call we unanimously agreed that we should be unblinded as to the nature of the regimens given to the coded groups the unblinding actually happened in august , after statisticians compiled their interim report for the safety committee not march the account given by the lead investigators in stopping the active intervention caret makes it sound as if urgent action was undertaken in march to begin a stand down of the experiment that 's not what happened not by a long shot when the safety committee got its first look at unblinded data in august , there was no doubt that caret 's study population was experiencing the same elevated cancer rates seen by the finns the safety committee took a vote on whether to stop the caret trial and found itself deadlocked two members of the five person committee were in favor of stopping caret the others thought it would be better to go ahead the rationale for continuing in spite of elevated cancer in the treated group here i quote from the account given in data monitoring in clinical trials was the statistical significance of the difference had not crossed the o brien fleming boundary i e , this could still be a chance finding the effect was surprisingly rapid and must mean if real that preexisting but undiagnosed lung cancers had had their growth accelerated by the regimen we knew of no mechanism of the action of beta carotene that could have induced such an effect there were other chemoprevention trials using beta carotene ongoing , to stop caret now would have an undesirable adverse effect on these trials we owed it to science to be absolutely certain of the adverse effect before stopping the trial the two members who favored a stop cited these reasons this was the second trial to show an adverse effect of beta carotene chemoprevention it was extremely unlikely to be due to chance we owed it to the participants to prevent possible further harm to them it was perhaps particularly unfortunate that the adverse effect appeared to be present in asbestos workers as well as current smokers the adverse effects appeared not to be restricted to lung cancer there appeared to be an adverse effect on cardiovascular disease as well incredibly , even though the finns had just shown in a much larger study population a definite correlation between beta carotene usage and lung cancer in high risk individuals , and even though caret 's own data replicated those results perfectly , and even though caret was administering a higher dose of beta carotene to its participants than the finns had used possibly putting people at much greater risk , a decision was made to continue caret , on the absurd assumption that after more data were accumulated , the bad trend line would prove to have been nothing more than a statistical fluke in september , a year after the first interim analysis , the safety committee got a look at updated results they were even worse than before many memos and meetings and conference calls and cross country flights by nci personnel later , a decision was finally reached in mid december to pull the plug on caret the decision was approved on december then everyone adjourned for christmas holidays then on january , , letters went out yes , by snail mail to all caret participants , informing them of the decision to end the study and the reasons for the decision caret found increases in all cause mortality , cardiovascular mortality , and not shown here lung cancer mortality in high risk individuals who took beta carotene and retinol n engl j med when caret 's results were published in may in the new england journal of medicine , the medical world was aghast to learn that administration of beta carotene and retinol to high risk individuals actually increased the rate of lung cancer by compared to placebo cardiovascular mortality , likewise , went up the finnish atbc study had found an increase in lung cancer of , based on a beta carotene consumption of mg day in the caret study , participants had taken a higher dose of beta carotene mg day they got more cancer hindsight is an evil game , and it 's easy to bash nci for not pulling the plug on caret earlier than it did without knowing all the particulars but frankly , what 's to know ? the finns published their results in april anyone could have looked at those results , then looked at the caret experimental protocol and study population , and immediately seen the red flags even without knowing the unblinded results , it would have been prudent to halt or at least begin winding down the study in april , three and a half years ahead of the planned stop date instead , a befuddled safety committee and a bureacracy entrenched national cancer institute waited until january , to send letters by first class mail to people who were unnecessarily dying in the irritatingly self congratulatory account of this travesty in stopping the active intervention caret , we 're constantly reminded that the study was terminated months early , as if it 's something to be proud of the fact is , the study was terminated a minimum of two years later than it should have been , due to negligent disregard of the finnish results which were known ahead of time to nci higher ups the finns , too , should have stopped early , as soon as it became apparent that the treatment groups had diverged in the wrong direction from the placebo group , which is to say , in year of the year study to argue that it was okay to wait an extra two years to stop the caret study because the formal stopping criteria had not been met is a phony argument when caret finally was stopped , the stopping criterion had still not been met as i said before , i 've provided more detail on atbc and caret and other deadly vitamin trials in a separate post at big think please read that post before deciding whether to adjust your daily vitamin routine in the end , you might want to consider scaling back your use of vitamins e and a if you 're at high risk of cancer and maybe even if you 're not at high risk the evidence says these supplements are harmful for at least some people i 'll post more on the subject here over the next few days please share this story with your social media contacts if you found it helpful and please see the companion post at http bigthink com devil in the data the dark side of antioxidants
