we all have a mind and we all know that it does n't always work as it should do , just like any other area of our body although i have addressed the problems and advice coming from certain mental health problems , i have n't addressed what mental health is itself everyone has a mind , and looking after it is just as important as looking after your body because without one , you ca n't necessarily do as well without the other it 's becoming more common that perhaps people 's mental health is n't as it should be in ! this tends to be defined under the umbrella term of mental illness just as if you were to have a physical illness , mental illness just means that your mental health is n't working perhaps as it should do , for example causing different behaviours and moods disorders can include anxiety , depression , schizophrenia and so on and these all have a range of remedies to try and help bring your mental health back to where you 'd want it to be just like physical illness , recovering from mental illness may take a while and may take a range of different remedies to find the best way for you to get better mental health is the same as physical health and it 's just about trying to get better in the best way you can it 's common to experience mental illness and you should n't be ashamed of doing so getting a cast for a broken leg is just as important as getting medication to balance your serotonin best wishes , amy xx
