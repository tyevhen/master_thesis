dear a b curtiss i read extensively in several disciplines among which is psychology and have amassed a fairly respectable library were i to rank all my books according to how effectively they dealt with their topic , depression is a choice would be at , or very near , the top i am in my fourth reading since acquiring the book in , i believe , after my first reading , my focus has been not so much on depression , but on choice i wouldn t even hazard a guess as to how many times i ve read page i say all the foregoing to introduce the following question have you ever considered , or would you consider writing a book on choice , not just as it pertains to depression , but as it pertains to all of life ? i have come to the conclusion that choice is a marvelous and sizeable treasure that is simply handed to us long before we are capable of handling it responsibly it has become disgustingly common and popularly acceptable for people , when confronted by their difficulties or failures , to deny the existence of choice or their misuse of it refusal to accept personal responsibility is so prevalent that , in my opinion , it has become an element of our culture who knows if a book on the topic would change anything , but believe me , if i had credentials that would lend credibility to such a work , i d try it myself i hope you will give this serious consideration thank you for depression is a choice a applaud you for your honesty , and for mustering the courage to bare yourself to your readers very sincerely , r g s dear r g s your letter encouraged me to read page myself it s good to be reminded , even for me it is always a danger when we think we know it all already , and cease to remember that each day is new and therefore , each day we see things not as they are , but as we are that particular day a b curtiss
