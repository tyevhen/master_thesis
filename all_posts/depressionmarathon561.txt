five thousand , three hundred , seventeen dollars and twenty cents that 's how much the social security administration wants from me within the next days much to my surprise , the letter demanding repayment arrived a few days ago here 's what 's going on when i was hospitalized last spring and could n't return to work , i temporarily went back on social security disability insurance ssdi after a couple of months , i returned to work in june , i called the social security administration and told them i was back working , therefore my ssdi payments should stop they did n't stop approximately one month after i called , my social worker called to tell them i was back at work , and when the payments continued , she later called again it did n't matter unfortunately , ssdi continued paying me until october , knowing i was not deserving of these funds , i attempted to save as much of them as i could but i could n't save it all i missed more work , without pay , after my knee surgery and then i missed another weeks of work , without pay , when i was most recently hospitalized for treatment of my depression i did n't go out and buy anything fun i did n't spend a penny on self gratification the money went where it was supposed to go it went to living expenses , bills , groceries , etc here 's the rest of the story i originally received a letter requesting repayment in early december i think i appealed , as was my right , by detailing the financial hardship i would endure if i payed them , in one lump sum i was hoping to at least negotiate a payment plan as of last week , i had n't heard one word regarding that appeal nothing and then i got this letter demanding immediate repayment the current letter begins by saying , you were notified that we had scheduled a personal conference for you on january , , to discuss the denial of your waiver request , but you did not come in for the personal conference or ask us to reschedule it therefore , there is no basis for changing the decision to deny you waiver request you should refund the , overpayment within days the letter goes on to say i have no further appeal rights because i missed this personal conference so much for working out a payment plan i was stunned by this letter not only had i never been notified of a personal conference , i was never notified they had denied my appeal ! i had n't heard one word from the social security administration until i received the overpayment demand just a few days ago i was , and still am , absolutely distressed by this i'm not in a position right now to pay them , in one lump sum , but that apparently does n't matter i'm frustrated and scared i did my best to follow the rules i took the steps i was supposed to take , but it was all for naught worse , the letter 's tone is scolding and demanding it makes it sound like i stole the money and then ignored multiple attempts to recover it nothing could be further from the truth it was the social security administration 's mistake which put me in this position , and now i'm being treated like a criminal i'm now in a stressful , defensive position in the next few days , i will have to call social security , hope to talk with a real person , explain the entire situation , and hope someone will actually care this is a nightmare i do n't do well with financial stress , and this is about as stressful as it gets
