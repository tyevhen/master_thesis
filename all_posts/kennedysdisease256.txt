another research paper was published this week the oxford journals article was interesting , but slightly above my head absence of disturbed axonal transport in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy abstract spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy sbma , or kennedy s disease , is a late onset motor neuron disease mnd caused by an abnormal expansion of the cag repeat in the androgen receptor ar gene on the x chromosome , encoding a polyglutamine sequence poly q in the protein product mutant poly q expanded ar protein is widely expressed but leads to selective lower motoneuron death although the mechanisms that underlie sbma remain unclear , defective axonal transport has been implicated in mnd and other forms of poly q disease transcriptional dysregulation may also be involved in poly q repeat pathology we therefore examined axonal transport in a mouse model of sbma recapitulating many aspects of the human disease we found no difference in the expression levels of motor and the microtubule associated protein tau , in spinal cord and sciatic nerve of wild type wt and sbma mice at various stages of disease progression furthermore , we found no alteration in binding properties of motor proteins and tau to microtubules moreover , analysis of axonal transport rates both in cultured primary motoneurons in vitro and in vivo in the sciatic nerve of adult wt and mutant sbma mice , demonstrated no overt axonal transport deficits in these systems our results therefore indicate that unlike other motoneuron and poly q diseases , axonal transport deficits do not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of sbma after reading the above , i asked our biology professor for a translation as usual , he did a great job in explaining how the process works and what this research meant there has been speculation that the reason that the motor neurons die in kennedy s disease is that the transport of materials to the end of the axon is blocked the motor neurons are the cells that tell muscle to contract they have a cell body main part of cell with all the usual cell parts is in the spinal cord each cell also has a long tube like process called an axon that connects to the muscle cell thus , the axon is a long continuation of the motor neuron it is very long and thin can be over feet long in some instances since the cell body is where the cell machinery exists , the cell must be able to transport needed chemicals to the end of the axon this is axonal transport if this transport were to be blocked , then the axon , and thus the cell , would no longer function this paper apparently has evidence that this axonal transport is not defective in kennedy s disease i am not certain how this helps , but i am certain that it might be beneficial for researchers in their work the better we understand what works and what doesn t has to be helpful as they search for a treatment
