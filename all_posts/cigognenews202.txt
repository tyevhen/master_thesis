i am going to take several leaps the first is to equate the imprint with methylation of the gene cell that is , as very early trauma gestation and its surroundingsenhance methylation , adding part of the methyl group to the cell this is a sort of trace or memory marker that alters the gene and imprints the memory for life well , for life is a big statement since if someone finds a way to rid us of those traces it will not be for life which i believe we have we are now on our way to confirm this hypothesis the point being that the trace of methylation is an analog to my notion of the imprint an embedded memory that endures and affects so much of us , our minds and body organs that is the second leap of course it is complicated matter and i do not touch on that , but by and large , it is a good index of what methylation means why do i make that leap ? because we are dealing with early trauma and it may well have to with the later development of cancer let me put it differently we see very few cancers over the years of our therapy i believe in part it may be due to addressing directly the memory trace over months of primal therapy , wending the way down to lower brain levels , finally arriving at the deepest and most remote memories and reliving them bit by bit what seems to happen to my patients is that full reliving without words and often without tears , the mark of primeval imprints , undoes the agony of the memory without disturbing the memory itself the memory no longer drives us and impels neurosis that means no longer a deregulation of so many organ systems and thought processes there is then a systemic normalization of so much of brain and physical processes it is my assumption , then , that this normalization reverses methylation , at least in part we note in late research on depression and suicide measured by autopsy , that the heavier methylation is associated with greater tendencies toward suicide that so called psychologic behavior is ultimately a matter of neurophysiologic processes not the reverse , mind you , where everything is a brain dysfunction with no reference to or understanding of key early experience the brain gets impaired through early experience it is not a matter of investigating or changing thoughts and behavior in therapy that matters it means looking into the deep neurologic imprints altering the behavior of the genes in that way , we will stop imagining that it is all a matter of genetics , rather than epigenetics yes , of course , there are genetic effects , but in my experience they are not so effective and dominating as epigenetics this is being supported by late work in addiction see , e heller , et al , locus specific epigenetic remodeling controls addiction and depression related behaviors nature neuroscience , october , see the abstract http www nature com neuro journal v n abs nn html one thing they found was that histone methylation the locus in the nucleus accumbens the reward area was enough to control drug behavior again , it is no brain impairment but brain reaction to trauma that may cause all this what researchers are doing is finding the neurologic concomitants of it all still with no mention of what goes on early in our lives that may produce these changes the research i am citing is from disorder in gene control system is a defining characteristic of cancer dana farber cancer institute , science daily , december , see http www sciencedaily com releases htm so what are they saying ? basically , that derangement of the methylation process has a direct bearing on the effectiveness of cancer therapy and what does that mean ? that changes and trauma very early in life impact the methylation process and deregulate it this makes cancer therapy more opaque there are times when this disorganization may help tumors adapt to its altered nature because of trauma in short , disordered methylation may lead to cancer progression this is far too complicated , but there is a strong relationship between imprints and the development of serious disease and one way to measure this is through methylation which gives us a quantitative index of how much damage there is and where it occurs in brief , when we think of the primal imprint we need to think methylation let s stop calling all the disorders of the brain and behavior a brain disease we have had some success in treating epilepsy is it a brain disease or one of bad early experience ? or is addiction a brain disease ? we have treated many addicts and have found that when we take away the embedded pain we stop the need for pain killers if we neglect experience , specifically very early experience , we can never know how experience alters the brain we cannot understand how methylation becomes disordered with adverse experience and what role that plays in the development of cancer and other serious diseases what i have done is point the way to the imprint and shown how to get there to change the whole system now science is helping to pinpoint so much that is helpful but let us not deify pure science is the sine qua non clinical work here preceded pure neurologic science by years our nerve cells store knowledge and store memory , and in those memories lies trauma and its enduring effects on all of us we must address those traumas , not with words but with experience psychotherapy must ultimately involve experience
