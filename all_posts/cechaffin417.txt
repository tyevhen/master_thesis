poems are like rorschachs and reveal the man within in ode to a grecian urn keats achieves almost a manic transcendence , while hardy s neutral tones is a dark depiction of a failed romance in my first ghazal , then , given my current state of mind , it is not surprising that i dwell on the dark side of reality since i chose to submit it to a journal , however , i had to delete it from above it was called , reality bites i go over and over rehearsing in my mind what i will say to my shrink today i feel a bit ashamed that i have been so public with my disease , almost as if that s the only thing i ll be remembered for , though the same can be said of robert burton and kay jamison and it is therapeutic to put these things in writing , which helps objectify my plight to myself i want to say that trying to fight depression only worsens it in my experience acceptance is all until it passes if your truck is stuck in the mud , you can spin your wheels or take out a good novel and wait for the mud to dry you can t dry the mud yourself those who are not manic depressive tend to overestimate what behavioral changes can do for a deep depression look i just took a class on mushrooms and went mushroom hunting i m in an html class where i m building a website i start a master gardener program in january i try to walk an hour a day i ve lost a little weight on kathleen s high protein diet i ve written a poetry review for a major newspaper i finalized three poetry manuscripts and have them all floating in various contests i correspond with literary friends sometimes i go fishing i do household chores like vacuuming , the dishes , cooking i spent a long time nursing a vegetable garden along until october when it essentially died i give advice to friends and family about their mood disorders i help take care of our old dog , kenyon i pay the bills i have to plan for medication refills through the net from canada i help with shopping we watch good movies come nightfall but this little bit is not enough to justify my life not even a pulitzer would justify my life the question is , why do i feel it necessary to justify my life ? because my self esteem , especially when depressed , is based on achievement , not loving acceptance i wish i could change this about myself when my mood is up i can approach this view alas , for now it remains as distant as antarctica thine in truth and art , c e chaffin
