perhaps i'm being too sensitive perhaps i'm reading too much into innocuous words and statements i do n't know you tell me over the last couple of weeks i 've had doctors , nurses , therapists , friends and coworkers ask questions of me which i have found offensive and invalidating each time i responded kindly in the moment , but the questions stuck with me and later led to negative feelings i found myself mulling them over and wondering , would that question have been posed if i had breast cancer ? and i think the answer is no within just the last couple of days , after i detailed how severe this recent depression episode has been , how isolated and detached i 've been feeling , and how extremely low my mood has been , a few of the immediate comments were , are you working ? are you running ? what fun things are you doing for yourself ? the implication , i believe , is clear are these people not implying that i 'd feel better if i was working , running , getting out of the house , doing something fun , etc ? in other words , my low mood is at least partly my own doing am i wrong to find these questions and comments offensive and invalidating ? i do n't think the people who posed these questions did so to overtly blame me for my symptoms , but i do think these types of statements are another manifestation of the stigma surrounding mental illness the inability to work , exercise , socialize or find fun in normal activities are n't seen as symptoms of my illness but rather as character defects if i just did this , that , or the other , i 'd feel better but not being able to do this , that , or the other is the result of my illness , not the cause of it ! if i told you i was having low energy , found it difficult to get out of my house , and or was n't socializing because of my breast cancer symptoms , would you ask the same questions ? i do n't think so i think the more immediate response would be something along the lines of , i'm sorry things are so hard right now , or i wish you felt better , and or what can i do to help ? these comments and questions validate the person 's experience rather than question it or try to fix it this severe and lengthy depression episode has me feeling tired and battle weary , so perhaps i'm being too sensitive but i 've felt invalidated over and over again , even by professionals who should know better , during the past couple of weeks if curing depression was as simple as getting out of the house and going for a run , i certainly would n't struggle with depression ! i do n't think people realize how invalidating these comments and questions are am i right ? if i am right , i'm not sure what to do about it i usually do n't have the awareness or energy in the moment to politely educate the offending person and educating someone after the fact is rarely helpful or effective but i'm tired of feeling as if i'm somehow to blame for what 's happening to me depression is to blame , and i do n't have depression because i'm lazy , or antisocial , or uneducated my brain is sick that 's why i have depression i'm no different than the person with a sick pancreas who has diabetes we both have biological , treatable illnesses why ca n't people get that ?
