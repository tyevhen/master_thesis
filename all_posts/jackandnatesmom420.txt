i have said before that fine and gross motor development have been a challenge for jack he walked at months , used to stand at the top of slides and look at me like lady are you nuts ? , and jumping was a really really big deal and he has never stopped we have been working on pumping forever it 's frustrating for a kid to learn this skill because for the longest time they feel like they are doing nothing , until something finally clicks and they realize they have to lean into it and really work to get moving over the past years , i have tried many motivators , the most popular being flapping his wings , and being an airplane legs out taking off , legs in coming in for a landing this has at least helped him get the concept down , but we have never before had actual movement like this ! ! ! ! i have to try and calm myself down during these developments luckily we do not have the first time he pedaled his tricycle up and down the street on video because it would have consisted of mommy sobbing and screaming go , go , go while daddy laughed at me and said shhhhhh you 're distracting him ! on that note , please put your computer on mute or at least do your best to disregard my shrill voice on this video i was too excited not to share ! ! ! !
