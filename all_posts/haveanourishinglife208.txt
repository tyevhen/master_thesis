photo published on web here just when i think i am doing really well , i get the feet knocked out from under me i am looking up from the ground thinking , how did this happen ? well , it s more like i am looking out from under my fortress of covers and soggy tissues at two o clock in the afternoon i have been taking care of myself , going to therapy , taking my meds , meditating , and talking about my feelings in my opinion , i am doing everything right heck , even in the books of professionals , i am taking steps in the right direction a prominent symptom of depression is severe lack of energy and feeling tired all the time it is not necessarily the want of motivation i think i would , for sure , be motivated if i didn t want to sleep all the time maybe i don t know maybe not anyway , this symptom of fatigue is usually the last one to go away in the process of healing just when i think i am gaining speed toward a slight resemblance of normalcy , i find i am taking steps backward at least , that is what it feels like the mornings have always been really difficult for me there is something so incredibly daunting about the start of new day each new day i have to start over and build my self esteem from scratch i get no roll over days in the first moments of the morning , i have extreme hopelessness s and deep despair i have to remind myself about what i believe in and why i am doing what i am doing and then , i play that track on repeat there is no amount of healthy eating , exercise , coffee , vitamin d , or energy boosting smoothies that will do the trick i am sure they help a little but for all you self proclaimed doctors , there is no quick fix or cure every morning i have to rebuild my positive outlook , thought for thought , block for block sometimes , i can build a sturdy tower out of legos that lock into each other and are difficult to knock down at those times , i am really proud of my creations most of the time , however , all i can muster is a crooked structure that kind of resembles a tower but looks more like the game jenga in the final moments before it tumbles a slight breeze or a soft bump of the table and i come crumbling down out of times , my tower falls over before i even get out of bed the whole day i am behind , trying to pick up the pieces and rebuild with no luck at the end of the day , all i can be proud of is my commitment to try again tomorrow i thought by now i would back at my full time job , climbing the ladder of success , and writing my book about how to recover from depression in five easy steps but at this point , i am not sure if i will ever fully recover i am not trying to be dramatic i am not trying to get pity i am just being honest the point is , i realize now that it doesn t really matter if i do recover or not i have to accept my situation either way and take it just one day at a time just one day at a time below are some tricks that are no guarantee , yet seem to have helped me in the mornings so far i take extra time to get ready before i have to go somewhere i stick to a morning routine as much as possible i don t book my schedule too full in one day i keep things flexible so that , if i have to , i can cancel or reschedule at a moment s notice if i am getting anxious about doing something , i get myself ready to walk out the door , even if i am hours away from leaving not that i wait at the door for hours like a puppy waiting for the school kids to get home i just prepare all the necessary things when i am feeling anxious then i do other things in the mean time i am less likely to panic and back out at the last minute if i practice this technique i will continue to practice the steps toward recovery i will continue to follow the advice of what will heal my brain and i will continue to pray for the strength and guidance when i am out of options but most of all , i will continue to hold onto the hope that god is going to take care of me no matter what happens whether or not i receive healing from this illness , i know it is god s will either way and all i can do is pray and build my tower one lego at a time
