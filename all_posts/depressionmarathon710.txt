i spent the day getting prepared to leave for austin tomorrow i have to leave my house bright and early to get to the airport on time , so i am all packed i 'll be totally ready as soon as my last load of laundry dries i also cleaned all day in order to leave my home in decent shape for my new dog sitter it was a busy , but exciting day i'm anxious to get going ! puck did n't like all the packing and cleaning he knew something was up , and he got quite nervous at this point , he 's not willing to let me out of his sight i'm worried about leaving him with someone new , but i think everything will be fine of course i ca n't convince puck of that thankfully , i can count on bill and cindy to help out if needed it 's good to have good friends speaking of my good friends i spent last night with them bill made a steak dinner cindy and i made toll house chocolate chip cookies and our mutual friend tim brought morel mushrooms it was quite a feast satisfied , we sat at the table munching cookies and laughing long after dinner was done i left there much later than planned , but i left with a warm feeling of gratitude i am so grateful to have such wonderful , comfortable friends well , time to finish the laundry and get to bed i 've got to be up early i'm so ready to run this marathon , i ca n't wait ! usually i feel a little trepidation this close to race day , but not so far this time i hope the race turns out as good as i feel we shall see
