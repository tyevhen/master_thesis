i'm still here it 's been a week since i checked in that 's longer than i prefer to be away , but life has been incredibly tough lately depression has me it 's holding on so tight i ca n't slip free i'm confined i'm constricted i'm struggling i'm exhausted i could care less about anything and everything i'm sad , and overwhelmed , and barely functioning functioning ? i'm barely moving one thing that 's all i 've been able to do i have continued to get to work that 's it my house my body my exercise routine my chores my errands all of it , other than work , has been totally neglected it 's getting ugly around here the uglier it gets , the more overwhelmed i get , and the more suffocating my depression gets i ca n't breathe fuck depression ! fuck it
