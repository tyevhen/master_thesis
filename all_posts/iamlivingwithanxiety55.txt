when faced with multiple options , i often find it difficult to make a decision i suspect this is an average situation for a nervous person recently i decided to paint my kitchen , and choosing a color can be a daunting task for me there are just too many choices ! but as dr low reminds us , any decision will steady us , so i chose a color bungalow gold and got to work as i was painting , though , i realized that the color was way too dark i decided to finish the kitchen so i could take in the whole view , and my hunch was confirmed my kitchen shrank with such a deep hue i could feel angry temper well up inside me , as i scolded myself for not making a better decision , and i also felt fearful temper , as i wondered how others would view my mistake i take a lot of pride in my home , and i admit i often have strived to have the perfect residence , worthy of hgtv yet instead of working myself up this time , i left the kitchen went to bed and re evaluated the situation in the morning i still felt the color was too dark , so i reprimed the walls and selected a different color pear i also lowered my standards , reminding myself that this was not something that should threaten my mental health before recovery , i would have went into a full fledged panic over this situation i definitely would have called a lot of my friends and , as dr low says , to talk it up is to work it up although i forgot to endorse myself at the time , i m endorsing myself now for not working up this triviality
