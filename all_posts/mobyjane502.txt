hi this is n l and i am taking a psychology class studying your book depression is a choice i had a question about part of your book you discuss choice and how depression becomes a routine , and i was wondering if you think this develops due partly to habit , or how exactly it becomes a routine also you titled chapter depression junkies and you talk about how we become addicted to problems , how even the most life threatening addictions such as alcoholism , drug abuse , depression and promiscuity very soon become the status quo this is the neurological explanation of st augustine s warning , a habit , if not resisted , soon becomes necessity i was wondering if you could further discuss how depression becomes or is an addiction thank you so much for your time ! dear n l habitual routines , or thinking behaviors such as depression or cigarette smoking , or drinking , or migraines , or insomnia actually grow into neural patterns in the memory banks of your brain , neuron by neuron , as you do the behaviors or thinking patterns over and over since the brain works by learned association , more and more things start to become associated with the thinking behaviors and routines as you do them particular rooms , times of day , even colors or sounds , and smells can activate the neural patterns automatically through learned association here is the syndrome you encounter some particular sight , sound , or smell associated with depression , you feel depressed , you reach for a cigarette , or a drink , you lurch into a migraine or bottomless despair in an instant that is , associations can trigger due to a learned association with things that occur at the same time habitual routines are engaged in , or with other sights or sounds that are associated with the particular routines people who slide into these destructive routines are people who do not , on purpose , fashion coping mechanisms in advance for stressors or negative associations which occur in their lives , many with some regularity if you decide on doing a mind exercise when you feel yourself anxious , or sleepless , or afraid , or edgy for no reason , you are less likely to slide into a routine of chain smoking , drinking , or negative and downer thinking which triggers the fight or flight response , which causes the production of stress chemicals in the brain , which causes a depletion of metabolic processes and brings on the helpless routine of depression the neural pattern of depression can trigger , by itself , from association without negative thinking beforehand you can always do a mind exercise when the stressors occur , or even when the depression itself hits instantly at full force then , when the mind exercise has taken the edge off the anxiety , due to the anxiety or the depressive feeling not being thought while the exercise is taking place , the stress chemicals cease to be produced , the panic subsides , and a person can then move forward into small tasks or duties and thus take on their day addiction is the same as habit it is a mindset based upon a neural pattern you have built with certain behaviors over a period of time thinking is also a behavior the addiction surreptiously alleviates your needs because the addictions are associated with your stressors , and immediately occupy your attention automatically when stressors occur in a way the routines thus save you in that you do n't have to do anything to alleviate the actual stressors , you simply go with the routines a b curtiss
