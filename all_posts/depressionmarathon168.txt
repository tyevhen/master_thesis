delta airlines got me home from vacation today we were only hours late today sitting in atlanta , after the second delay was announced , i began having horrible visions of another nightmare trip thankfully , those visions did n't materialize it would have been nice to have arrived home on schedule , but i 'll take an hour and a half over an hour , overnight spent on a bench in the airport , delay anytime ! after recovering from my nightmarish trip to florida last week , i did call delta customer care about my mis adventures the delta customer care representative was quite appropriately apologetic , even admitting that delta failed in this instance , and she issued me another travel gift card so i received a total of for my troubles that will come in handy when i travel this fall thankfully , i am now back in my humble , albeit cold , home it 's nice to be back in my space i had a great time in florida with my parents it was n't super warm , but the sunshine sure felt nice my parents , at my encouraging i'm trying desperately to get them to move more walked with me almost every day , on the beach and through the woods i also met some of their friends , and we daily sampled the local cuisine i enjoyed myself , but i'm glad to be home , nonetheless i took a few pictures if i have the gumption , i 'll post them soon but right now i 've got to get ready for my return to work tomorrow i'm looking forward to resuming my regular routine work , jet , meetings and exercise pleasantly boring , i hope , just the way i like it
