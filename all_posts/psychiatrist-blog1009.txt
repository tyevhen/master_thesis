there 's nothing quite like blogging in a blizzard my house , by the way , is the one with the gutters torn off one side and draped across the front with the disconnected downspouts you will notice that our flat roofs have been shoveled off makes for a fine family project in the snow after having the insight that another inches could well cause their collapse so i thought i 'd give a plug to dr fred miller and his academy for film and psychiatry his 'filmosophy' reads film is nothing short of our struggle to understand people , culture and ourselves film engages all of our senses and in that way is like no other medium the parallels between the filmmaker and the psychotherapist are many each is acutely aware or should be that he or she is presenting an understanding of the human condition and also that the process of understanding in and of itself is healing and fulfilling both are subjects of intensive study and endless debate enjoy ! film seems like as a good a thing as any to do today , so long as the power holds brrrr from maryland , hon !
