boyfriend and i watched a movie tonight and the movie had michael cera in it during the movie , boyfriend said you totally have a crush on michael cera and i was like yeah two hours later boyfriend on a scale of one to ten , how much do you love me ? me eleven million boyfriend on a scale of one to ten , how much do you love michael cera ? me nine boyfriend that 's not a big gap me yeah especially not when you factor in how long i 've known you versus how long i 've known michael cera are you jealous ? boyfriend no me what if i was like 'i want to bone michael cera' ? boyfriend i would n't take you very seriously because you ca n't even say it with a straight face and then i looked boyfriend straight in the face and without even a whisper of a smile i said i want to bone michael cera and then boyfriend asked me if i was thinking about dead kittens because i usually think about dead kittens when i'm trying to keep a straight face , and i was all yeah and boyfriend was like so you just said 'i want to bone michael cera' while you were thinking about dead kittens ? and yes yes i did anyway , i have found that matters of the heart are best solved with statistics if i truly hope to figure out whether i like boyfriend or michael cera better , i'm going to have to crunch some numbers figures and charts figure after careful analysis , it looks like boyfriend wins to unless he turns out to be a rapist but if boyfriend and michael cera both turn out to be rapists , boyfriend still wins figure it still appears that boyfriend has a slight lead over michael cera and the trend would indicate that my affection for boyfriend will continue to stay high while my affection for michael cera is mostly dependent on whether or not i 've recently seen a movie that he was in but how do boyfriend and micheal cera fair when compared to all of the other things i love ? figure it still appears that boyfriend beats micheal cera by a slim margin and he beats that one part in midnight train by an even slimmer margin in fact , the chart would indicate that when midnight train is combined with my favorite part of midnight train , the resulting section takes up over of my capacity for love well , i'm going to try to go to bed because being nocturnal does n't appear to be good for my blog also , boyfriend went to bed about an hour ago and he was like i'm going to bed and then i was like i'm going to google michael cera and boyfriend was like i doubt michael cera will protect you from the orcs in the meth cellar which is probably true p s okay fine , technorati , here are your precious numbers tjvmnrsye
