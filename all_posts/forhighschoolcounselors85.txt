several weeks ago i attended a conference in reno , nevada when making my plane reservation , i was quite surprised that i would have a three hour layover in las vegas after a four hour flight , we finally landed in vegas ! looking out of my window , i saw some of the posh hotels on the strip and wished that i could visit i have never visited vegas before as i exited the plane , i was met with the sounds and lights of slot machines and i mean lots of them they were on the walls , near the restaurants , and each concourse wow , i thought , this is overwhelming living in the south , i have never really been exposed to gambling to this extent only the lottery and some video poker games in the back of some of the seedier mini marts and almost every shop was selling or promoting gambling after my brief stay in vegas , we finally landed in reno and headed to our hotel i had been in several casinos before , but i had never actually walked through the gambling area in fact , each time i had to get to the conference area , i had to walk through the casino so , whether it was in the morning or at night , people were gambling , drinking , and smoking cough , cough , cough each time i passed by my heart ached for those who sat expressionless at the slots sipping on their drinks while commercials show casino life as exciting and profitable , the majority of these folks looked far from happy honestly , many of them looked miserable , disheveled , and lonely casino reality fiction harrah 's come and play commercial yes , gambling is an addiction harvard medical researcher ,

reward and pleasure researchers found that gambling changes the flow of blood to the brain which is similar to the use of cocaine while the majority of youth who gamble will not develop an addiction , there is a small segment that will develop this addiction and experience problems in their relationships , school , and families unfortunately , many parents view gambling as a socially acceptable activity with little risk therefore , they introduce their children , as young as years old , to gambling buying lottery tickets , playing poker , and betting on sports teams since teens are high risk
