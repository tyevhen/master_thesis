i do n't know about you , but i cannot afford strong emotions i 've been cranky lately particularly at work , i 've been impatient , frustrated and cranky my patients have been spared , of course , but my coworkers have really been on my nerves ! reasons which justify my crankiness are valid , but that 's not the point i cannot afford impatience , frustration or crankiness strong emotions , especially strong negative emotions , sap my energy like little else when i let people get under my skin , i suffer when i let situations irritate me , i pay for it when i allow my frustration to build , i deteriorate cajoling negative emotions serves no useful purpose negative emotions cost rather than pay allowing myself to remain frustrated , angry or irritated leads inevitably to negative behavior , which is then followed by more negative emotions , both within and around me i do myself no favor by remaining discontent so today , while away from work , i am trying to clear my brain and body of negativity i am working to rid myself of restlessness , irritability and discontent i want to free my psyche and lighten my load , see people and situations in a different light , and quash rationalization in favor of acceptance it 's not necessarily easy , but it 's vital for my mental health my mental health is valuable , and expensive negative emotions do nothing to enhance it 's worth these emotions take , take , take without ever giving a penny back i cannot afford them the cost is too high if i want to change the course of the next few days , and i do , i have to let the negativity go i 've got to instead work for the cold , hard cash of acceptance ultimately , it is acceptance which will change my course and bring me peace
