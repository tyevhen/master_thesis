into a panic , stop and think , even if it 's for a moment , about what 's needed in this situation certain situations require immediate action , but many situations would be better handled by reflecting first on what 's needed before taking action hastily recognize what you can and ca n't control this is n't always easy to see but when it 's clear that there are elements of the situation
