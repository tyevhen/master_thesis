the central nervous system receives input from outside but also , importantly from insides , as well it processes and stores information so why exactly are we neglecting the nervous system that processes and contains inner input in therapy ? is it because we only can treat what we see , and since we don t see what s inside we imagine it doesn t exist ? or is it because some of us live in our heads and cannot believe in a life deep in the interior a life in the underground in the zone of the interior ? this is the system that responds to stress and threat the system that cares and feels it is the system of need and deprivation why ignore it ? it is the system that remembers early hurt and deprivation of suffocation at birth and of not being touched right afterwards it is the system that needs it is also the system that begins its connections with other brain circuits to help us mature and make us whole it is the system that begins the maturation of the blood and circulatory systems all detours are registered here , and here is where answers lie to early hurt and lack of emotional care and touch how on earth can we ignore the key system that remembers what must be remembered the system that fully informs us of what we underwent very early in our lives ? it is the system that speaks of epigenetics and how genes and their expression were permanently changed it is the system that forms our personality , that shapes how we respond to others in life whether we battle on or give up easily , our future passivity or aggressivity all this is set down so early but it is there for the looking all we have to do is ask and seek how in therapy can we not believe in all this and go on treating only the here and now ? the early traumas take on and store early indifference and neglect by parents it is early on that some neurons settle in the brainstem while others find their home in the neo cortex to make us top heavy with intellect and prevent easy access to our feelings don t we want to know how mother s taking drugs and alcohol caused the detour of key neurons and changed our bodily functions ? doesn t this count when we are trying to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it ? don t we want to know how experience in the womb reduced the brain s dendrites and changed inner communication ? this resulting in learning problems and add ? we want to know how experience changed the brain to take in less input and therefore to be easily overwhelmed with too much stimuli or input we must know that all the key major changes have taken place before we play in the schoolyard even before we have words to describe our problems our first major phase of development lies in the brainstem where we organize terror , rage and impulsivity from this later comes feeling and then thoughts there is a whole world of living before the top level even exists and a whole world of hurt , too it is the lowest level that impairs heart function and is the precursor for later cancer it is the site for organizing later diabetes and high blood pressure so when we wonder about an early heart attack or stroke we need to look for answers in the right places how is it possible to understand any of this and at the same time ignore its existence ? it means not only ignoring months and years of personal development but millions of years in the development of mankind we musn t forget that our brain neurons migrate and how and where they go depends on early experience and it is early experience that ultimately determines brain growth this reminds me of the giant painting of a nude and there is a little old lady looking only at the flowers around her we cannot afford to look away and still help people cannot afford to not examine the critical period and not to understand the importance of that period for our development how love at fifteen cannot ever , ever make up for its lack at age minus eight months and while i am at it , there is a significant meeting going on by august mental health professionals who are renewing the diagnostic psychiatric manual and guess what ? they are completely ignoring those key lower levels of our existence when we examine animal life and see how important the critical period is , how those not licked or nuzzled suffer forever , we know how critical the critical period is how the brain shrinks when love is missing and reduces in size how the brain is denser with early love untouched newborn animals and humans too die much earlier there is a premature atrophy of the brain it is becoming clear that early lack of love affects attachment and impacts the right brain that deals with attachment so what is it all about alphie ? love love love
