as i sit here typing , the sun is setting leaving golden hues on the tallest buildings the sky is a gorgeous blue with streaks of white and purple gray clouds two contrails leave a white scar in the air like a badly formed , backwards y i notice all this and still my brain has not returned to me first , the storm yesterday was a neurological nightmare , made worse by my ogre like personality which was stoked by the electrical storm in my mind i fell asleep around pm , early for me these days , and slept for four hours later i napped for two somehow this was enough to recharge my mind and give me enough presence to zip around town like a hummingbird on wheels even with the ac on full blast my brain still cooked due to our right passenger window being stuck open my mind does n't function well over f and the minivan was at f still i'm glad that i was able to be useful i dropped the elf off at work and the leprechaun off at play practice , i picked out and fitted a trike for the goblin , put gas in the car , picked up some slurpees , and even gave the goblin riding lessons it all sounds so drab and mundane , but after being couch bound all day yesterday it was a nice change until my brain melted it happened on the phone with my wife i had a meltdown when i discovered i was stuck babysitting until after pm with a late article to write and a book to dust off and work on , i had been looking forward to some time to myself i had an epiphany as i stared up at that calming blue sky i realized why i think i 'll have more time to myself every summer once school is out i'm afraid the pixie and the elf spoiled me they were such good girls , always taking care of themselves , and not getting into trouble they played dolls for hours , or watched tv or read books the goblin and leprechaun on the other hand squabble and screech they break things they ca n't be left unsupervised for a second or they 'll create new and terrifying messes they require constant , non stop micromanagement they 've been killing my creative self it 's my old nemesis , boredom micromanaging is torture for an adhd mind at least for mine i just want to slip into the sweet bliss of hyperfocus and get work done , but my li'l fairies keep me skimming the surface of productivity like a dragonfly evading fish now , more than ever , i must master my sleep schedule so that i can work before they wake up , not after when i put on the daddy hat first thing in my morning then take it off late at night when my brain is fried and useless like now time passes my heart and mind want to fly , but instead they are shackled to a horse and plow sometimes i forget that this was the life i chose for myself i am simply having a difficult time of late not losing my identity while i labor tonight as i decompressed at the kitchen table , the elf began to talk to me she shared with me her thoughts on her grown up day how she worked and went to a film festival how she has learned there is a difference between being a child and being a teenager how she has learned that there is a difference between being a teenager and being an adult as i sat there her words flowed over me so sincere so serious so filled with wonder and pride and self discovery this type of moment is what parents live for we put in so much heart and soul into the raising of these wonderful spirits we just need a sign that all our efforts are paying off that we are n't just wasting our time i gave up a doctor 's meeting to drive my girls around it was supposed to be an alternative approach to managing my ticking via chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture i canceled the meeting with nary a thought it is easy to lose ourselves in our job as parents the children are always more important as i sat there tonight ticking and twitching as i had the night before , i despaired it 's true i felt nobody really appreciated my efforts at the same time i felt so frustrated and trapped , unable to move off the couch hating myself for needing the help of others what a godsend it was that i thought to move into the kitchen when i did otherwise , i may have missed that blonde beam of cheery optimism blasting its way into the storm of my cynical and weary mind sometimes we need these random moments of epiphany to push ourselves up into the saddle again life can be so burdensome it 's too easy to lose ourselves in our troubles and forget to look up and out and beyond
