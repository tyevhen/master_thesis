i'm feeling a little bit better yesterday i got out of the house for my usual aa meeting early in the morning it was a little difficult being surrounded by so many chatty people at first , but i settled in after a bit on the way home , i could feel the darkness surrounding me , so i did n't go home ! i went over to bill and cindy 's home for some pancakes and espresso they got a new toy yummy ! after an hour or so at their house , i had to come home i was whipped napping helped i felt better again after my nap , i stared at my bike i did n't feel like going , but i had just enough energy to get out the door thank god , because in less than minutes i wanted to go home i did n't i soldiered on i got a little lost and briefly ended up on a gravel road that was exciting no worries , i found my way back on course it was warm and windy , and i was wishing i was done , but i kept going after minutes , miles , and one hill too many , i made it home i needed another nap i had to rest again that ride really wiped me out but i'm so glad i went i actually have a relay triathlon with two of my brothers next weekend i 'll be doing the bike stage , and i 've been feeling really guilty about not practicing i'm definitely not in shape fortunately , the bike route is only miles so i think i 'll be able to handle it hopefully , i 'll have the motivation to ride again before the race at least i went today , right ? i'm encouraged i was able to get out i'm encouraged i was able to last for minutes it was n't the fastest ride , but i gave myself permission to go as slow as i needed to go in order to continue i'm definitely still being racked by the fatigue of this current dip , but maybe things are improving ? i do n't know i try not to think or worry about it it will pass when it passes until then , i 'll keep taking one day at a time and one step or pedal stroke at a time
