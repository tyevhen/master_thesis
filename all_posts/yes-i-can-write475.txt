today i decided , after much boredom holed up inside like a hermit , to go outside in the beautiful sunshine and sunbathe i rarely do that , what with evil rays and all that , but it was just such perfect weather today and i need to get a bit more colour ! i took pictures , to i can never resist taking pictures p i got a book on neo paganism , so that should be interesting to read , even if it is over years old ! oh , and i also went bra shopping with my mother and sister , an errand that takes me about minutes tops , and my sister over an hour oh well overall boring day i guess i'm sure i'm forgetting stuff , but i'm too tired to think , nevermind write so i'm off possibly to bed for now you might also like my th birthday images of spring it begins in fire a very little bit about animism linkwithin
