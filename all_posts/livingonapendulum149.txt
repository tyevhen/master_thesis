researchers do n't know and with details scarce about its cause and treatment , dealing with the condition can be maddening we have answers to common questions about fibromyalgia in women plus , test your women 's health iq what causes fibromyalgia syndrome ? genetics may play a role in developing fibromyalgia but no one really knows what causes the syndrome and there are no known risk factors the most prevalent theory is that fibromyalgia results from a disturbance in the central nervous system called central sensitization , which may intensify pain signals linked to that theory is the notion that patients have higher amounts of a compound called substance p in their spinal fluid , which increases their sensitivity to pain another theory there may be two types of fibromyalgia primary fibromyalgia , which occurs spontaneously , and secondary fibromyalgia , which may be triggered by trauma such as a car accident or by certain infections , such as lyme disease and hepatitis c some researchers think that the primary type is caused by a sleep disturbance , but it s also possible that the sleep disturbance is a symptom of fibromyalgia i often hear fibromyalgia , chronic fatigue syndrome and lupus mentioned together are they similar ? although the three are separate conditions , symptoms of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome overlap and fibromyalgia and lupus both involve the muscle and bone network in our bodies , which can cause confusion between the two illnesses fibromyalgia is characterized by many symptoms including muscle pain , fatigue , sleep disturbances , irritable bowel syndrome and , in some people , depression despite its consistent general characteristics , it can be tough to diagnose because symptoms vary from patient to patient the main symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome cfs include overwhelming fatigue memory loss muscle soreness sore throat swollen glands symptoms can coincide or come and go in individual cycles doctors usually diagnose cfs through a process of elimination they rule out other potential causes of long term fatigue lupus is an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks itself it may start with joint pains , which patients can confuse with the muscle pains of fibromyalgia diagnosed by blood tests that show a high level of certain antibodies , lupus can be progressive and cause serious illness throughout the body people with lupus appear more prone to develop fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue , although researchers don t know why why do more women than men get fibromyalgia syndrome ? the majority of people with fibromyalgia are women , as is the case with lupus and cfs no one knows why women are affected more often than men is it age related ? fibromyalgia occurs most commonly in people between and years old , although it may arrive at any age , including childhood is it an autoimmune disease or a form of arthritis ? neither in fact , unlike inflammatory arthritis and autoimmune disease , which cause joint destruction and inflammation , fibromyalgia causes neither , despite symptoms of joint and muscle pain what are warning signs or symptoms of fibromyalgia ? alas , the symptoms of fibromyalgia arrive without warning they can , as mentioned earlier , include muscle and joint soreness , fatigue , sleep problems , irritable bowel symptoms , morning stiffness , depression and brain fog how is it diagnosed ? unfortunately , it s not uncommon to be misdiagnosed or have to see several doctors before a diagnosis is made your best bet is to see a rheumatologist , a doctor who specializes in conditions affecting muscles and joints he or she will look for symptoms and physical findings that meet a specific definition of fibromyalgia established by the american college of rheumatology for instance , a patient must have out of specific tender points on her body neck , shoulders , back , hips , and upper and lower extremities , and she must have had widespread pain in her muscles and joints lasting for three months or more without explanation the doctor will also work to rule out other diseases that have similar symptoms , such as lupus and polymyalgia rheumatica another autoimmune disease what lifestyle changes can i make to help alleviate the symptoms ? get plenty of gentle aerobic exercise like swimming or walking briskly , working up to at least minutes most days of the week weight gain commonly accompanies fibromyalgia thanks to the fatigue , muscle pain and poor sleep regular exercise will give you more energy , boost your mood , lower your weight and help you sleep better eating a healthy diet with lots of vegetables , fruits , whole grains , lean meats and dairy also will energize you , lower your weight and improve your overall health as you battle fibromyalgia you can also try eliminating the following foods , which appear to bother some people with fibromyalgia food additives like msg and nitrates the preservative in hot dogs and bacon aspartame nutrasweet sugar caffeine drinks but remember , what works for one person may not work for another what are the latest fibromyalgia treatments ? pregabalin lyrica , a fairly new medication , is the first to be approved by the food and drug administration fda for fibromyalgia studies suggest that it prevents pain and improves sleep by slowing the release of chemicals associated with pain older standbys can help too anti inflammatories such as ibuprofen and muscle relaxers can relieve pain antidepressants especially tricyclics amitriptyline or elavil boost mood as well as lessen pain and improve sleep supplements such as htp and sam e s adenosylmethionine may also be useful an amino acid , htp , converts to serotonin , a feel good neurotransmitter that helps boost mood and sleep sam e is an enzyme already present in the body that affects mood and lessens pain d ribose , a simple sugar in powder form , may lessen pain and fatigue when dissolved in water and taken times daily cognitive behavioral therapy , acupuncture , hypnotherapy and biofeedback may also be worth trying what is the long term outlook for a woman with fibromyalgia ? the good news is that fibromyalgia does not cause damage to muscles and joints that can lead to debilitation , immobility or joint replacement the bad news is that the symptoms typically don t resolve many women simply must learn to live with fibromyalgia the key is finding individual or combination therapies that help not all treatments help all patients with fibromyalgia discovering which help you is a matter of trial and error but scientists continue to work on finding the cause of fibromyalgia and , ultimately , a cure or effective treatment want to learn more ?
