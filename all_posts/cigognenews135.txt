and how is this possible ? luckily , each new harmful experience that remains un integrated at lower levels is later re represented in a higher level of the nervous system , where it is coded as the outsider or enemy lower level imprints send references higher up in the nervous system these higher level memories are wired together with their origins down below they form a neural circuit , a pathway and when circuits are wired together they tend to fire together hence resonance when a trauma exists later on , it may resonate with earlier imprints and set off the whole memory intact it is here that there may be inordinate responses to the most banal of events we are winding down again to the originating sources , the base of the feeling that is how we relive purely physiologic brainstem responses without ever acknowledging them it is how we get to preverbal events automatically when the primal imprint sends its message higher up , feelings are added to the impulse , and then later ideas and comprehension are included together these form a complete feeling all are necessary , eventually , in reliving that is how something in the present , a rejection , can set off such catastrophic feelings it is an organic process and needs to happen in a precise order , with the original feelings preserved it may be that specific brain frequencies tie these events together figuratively , what is going on is much like the stone thrown into the pond a ripple effect in the way the neurons connect to each other in mirrored progression when there are certain kinds of triggers , the brain conjures up its related history , intact , kindling like minded feelings and their physiology together recent research , both with primal patients and in neuroscience labs , is showing that being unconscious of pain is a survival mechanism , a protection against overwhelming input but the imprinted memory stays and continues to do its damage over a lifetime in short , it is not inert it has a force that threatens our ability to adapt , as i explain in detail shortly the deeper we go down in the brain the more powerful the force of memory hence the more unconscious it has to be for protection when the trauma is too great or too prolonged , the ability to adapt becomes more feeble and less flexible this is especially true of long term neglect and abuse here the memories seem to dig in and solidify , impervious to change and as conscious awareness lessens , the harm begins , both mental and physical we are then partially unconscious and are unaware of the damage fear memories are joined by multiple pathways and then are engraved what the new research shows is what i ve been saying all along that one needs to go back to the mood when the memory was imprinted but doing so artificially can make matters worse far better to arrive there slowly on an evolutionary time scale in their studies with mice , the northwestern researchers made an important observation which applies to our human patients it is difficult for therapists to access these memories because the patients themselves cannot remember the traumatic experiences that are the root cause of their symptoms which is exactly why we need to go slowly down the chain of pain , and let the patient decide how fast he can go the team noted that the brain functions in different states like a radio , switching from am to fm it s as if the brain is normally tuned to fm stations to access memories , but needs to be tuned to am stations to access subconscious memories , stated the lead investigator , dr jelena radulovic , dunbar professor in bipolar disease at northwestern s feinberg school of medicine in short , certain kinds of severe memories need to be tuned properly to receive painful messages i would put it differently , but we agree that traumatic memories are stored in the brain , where they remain and cause damage what the research team and i agree on is that we need to turn on the exact frequency of the feeling in other words , we need to go back in time to the imprinted pain , and no byways allowed we cannot skirt around the feeling the safeguard here is that we allow the patient to go back there in a precise manner so that any detours , the byways of feeling , are avoided and in our own research we found that there were specific frequencies that align with feelings they were never fast , which meant being over the primal zone we watched as we slowed the frequency with lights when feelings began to intrude they insist , as do i , that the brain needs to go back to the proper frequency and target a specific feeling my observation now for almost fifty years is that the natural evolutionary way is the proper path to follow nature is the sine qua non paul , m , august news retrieved from http www northwestern edu newscenter stories traumatic memories hide retrieve them html
