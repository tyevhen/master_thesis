i always get excited when my foundation runs out because it 's the perfect excuse to try a new one so far , i 've yet to find the perfect foundation , i 've tried everything from mac and laura mercier to maybelline and rimmel before my bottle ran out , i did in fact swear by rimmel 's wake me up foundation , it was light , with buildable coverage and did n't clog my skin but being a beauty junkie , i ca n't just stick to one product all my life so as i was nearing the end of the bottle , i was itching to try a new one ! after hours scrolling through beauty blogs , and youtubing reviews of drug store foundations , one product kept popping up , which is the one that i ended up purchasing bourjous healthy mix serum bourjous have various versions of this foundation the original healthy mix , the new healthy mix , and the healthy mix serum i went for the serum because it intrigued me , made from a vitamin rich fruit therapy formula , bourjous claims that imperfections are erased , signs of fatigued are smoothed and skin 's radiance is boosted for up to hrs the fact that it is also described as a gel foundation intrigued me further so off i went to boots to pick up a bottle the foundation itself is lovely it glides on easily leaving the skin with a beautiful glow , however , if you have oily prone skin , it may make you look shiny but nothing a little powder ca n't fix the coverage is very light , but buildable so if you prefer a thick , heavy duty foundation , this product wo n't be for you i like it because i hate feeling like i'm wearing a mask when i put my foundation on and i hate products that make my face look caked the dewy finish of this foundation makes my skin look awake and wonderfully healthy however it lasts no where near hours and i do have to keep touching it up during the day overall , i 'd give this product a it gives my skin a beautiful finish but can sometimes make me look shiny , and it 's staying power is n't as good as it makes out to be but its still a good product and i 'll definitely continue using it has anyone tried any of the other versions of the healthy mix foundation ? do they differ from the serum ? let me know until next time , stay classy suz x related posts fotd mini tutorial kylie jenner suzyblue things i 've learned in years suzyblue i want what she's wearing croatian inspiration suzyblue a year in pictures suzyblue my evening skincare routine suzyblue
