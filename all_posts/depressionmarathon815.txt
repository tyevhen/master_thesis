things are tough with my psyche i 've been back to the local beach to swim in open water twice since i last wrote things were not much better than they were originally on thursday night , i swam back and forth in the shallow water with a few forays over my head i still felt panicky once the water got deep i still could n't swim more than about yards without stopping to stand up if i got tired , and i was over my head , my body physically freaked i think this is bordering on a phobia , and i do n't consider myself a phobic type person at all ! needless to say , i left feeling very disappointed and frustrated and near tears again yesterday began with a very difficult race it was a mile trail run i 'd never run that particular race before , and i'm pretty sure i wo n't do it again wow , it was tough i was having one of those off days when running is difficult being off combined with hills , hills , and more hills was not a good combination i wanted to walk off the course at miles , but i had no idea where i was so i could n't ! by six miles i was walking up most of the hills by seven i was walking up all of them and then some i 've only collapsed to the ground once in my life after finishing a race yesterday changed that to twice perhaps i should n't have run the race , as the triathlon if i do it is only two weeks away but i thought a good race would help take my mind off my swimming distress unfortunately , it was n't a good race today , i returned to the lake with my brand new wetsuit it did n't help i still had trouble swimming i brought my friends bill and cindy along to watch cindy was helpful with some technique tips , and just having her there helped me relax a tiny bit but it seems it 's no use i could n't make it around approximately yards of buoys the swim for my triathlon is close to yards ! i made multiple attempts , and i made it about of the way around once but that 's not going to cut it even in a shorter triathlon worse , each effort ended with me swimming , panicky , back to shore cindy was patient and helpful , but in the end i was again frustrated and tearful this feels like a huge challenge to me part of me wants to go back out right now and work to conquer this but a large part of me is screaming , it 's time to quit ! i do n't know is this worth all the angst it 's causing ? my mood has dipped i'm having trouble focusing at work my house is a mess swimming trouble has got me overwhelmed , and it 's wreaking havoc in other areas of my life i do n't like that , but i do n't like not being able to do something either especially when i know i should be able to do it ! so i'm not sure it 's worth it , but i do n't think i'm ready to give up yet i 've got two weeks before the triathlon i'm not exactly hopeful , but i'm willing to keep trying
