dear a b i love the idea of moving the depression train off the brain track thank you so much for this discussion a dear a you are welcome i have another image for you that you might like my daughter gave me a good visualization the other day for curing the remorses the remorses are those negatives nagging at you when something has gone wrong , either socially or otherwise sometimes you make a dumb comment and embarrass yourself and wake up at o'clock in the morning with oh no , how could i ? or you just missed out on something wonderful due to someone else 's sabotage or fate simply gave you a big hit and you are suffering i had mentioned to my daughter that my way of handling these setbacks was to invest them this is a magical thinking exercise wherein you go to the positive returns cosmic bank and invest your failures because the cosmic bank returns to you in postive terms double whatever you invest in negative terms it 's just a way of getting things off your mind that bother you , and who knows ? maybe in the cosmic scheme of things you are doing yourself some great good my daughter says that a friend of hers does something similar she learned this from her dad who was a minister my daughter says it works wonders for her what does she do ? i offer it up wow powerful just offer it up works for me too
