if you follow a lot of people on twitter , but some of them do n't follow you back , and you 'd like to know who , exactly , those insensitive , churlish dolts are that do n't find your tweets amusing , i have a couple of practical tips for you with a quick javascript lesson thrown in for good measure ready ? first tip go to http friendorfollow com and enter your twitter name in the box when you click the magic button , you 'll see a new page appear , with the little thumbnail headshots of all your non followers lined up in a grid a veritable wall of infamy how do you harvest the usernames of these folks ? unfortunately , friendorfollow com does n't seem to have an export button unless i'm missing something there does n't seem to be any easy way to capture those names not to worry , though you know javascript if you 're running firefox , flip open the firebug console install firebug first , if you have n't done so already how can you live without it ? copy and paste the following code to the console convert dom to string markup new xmlserializer serializetostring document body root new xml markup convert string to xml users root a img alt magic ex expression for var i i users length i console log users i tostring when you run these lines of code , all the usernames of the folks whose thumbnails are shown on the page will be written to the output side of the firebug console let 's step through the code the first line of code creates an xmlserializer object mozilla api and uses it to serialize the dom starting with the 'body' node we need to use an xmlserializer here rather than just fetch the markup from innerhtml , because we do n't want to have gnarly ill formed html in the next step , lest we puke and die with our pristine , tidy if you will markup , we create a new ex xml object out of it via the xml constructor and assign the result to the cleverly named variable root in the highly magical third line of code , we use ex notation to suck out all the descendent a elements however many levels deep under root that also have an immediate child of img with an attribute of alt the information we want the username is in the alt attribute of the img note 'a' and 'img' are capitalized because the tidying process that occurs in step no results in capitalization of all html element names this is an important bit of canonicalization , since xml is case sensitive the for loop simply peels through our 'users' list and writes each name to the firebug console using firebug 's console log method note that the length of 'users' has to be obtained through a method call to length rather than via direct property lookup , because 'users' is not an ordinary javascript array it 's an ex node list you have to use the length method with not much extra work , you could wrap all the user data up in html tags and build a new page on the fly , and make firefox render it in the current window , if you wanted to or you can just print out the thumbnail images on a piece of paper , stick it to the wall , and find some darts the choice is yours
