be careful , my friend said , that 's a lot of work i had just relayed to her how incredibly busy i 'd been this week i worked of the last days , and i'm working tomorrow , too i usually work days per week my friend , wendy , knows i do n't tolerate working more than part time for very long in the past , lots of hours have led to depression relapses it sucks , but working part time is one of the compromises i 've had to make as a result of this illness i appreciated my friend 's quick concern she cares that 's nice but i hate that i have to be so vigilant when i work what , for most people , is just a normal work week after having this sunday off , i 'll be working monday through friday next week , too and i need to do that i need to work as of october st , i was only one month away from exhausting every spare penny i had just to pay my bills i wo n't feel comfortable or safe unless i replenish that money as soon as possible fortunately , we 're very busy , so i 've got plenty of opportunity to work i'm doing what i need to do to take care of myself , at least financially yes , i'm tired no , i'm not getting as much exercise as i 'd like yes , i'm spending more time solo no , i'm not eating as well as i 'd like those are all very important pieces to maintaining my mental health i know but feeling financially secure is just as important i know that , too so i 'll keep being vigilant about how i'm tolerating my increased work load i'm not going to put myself in jeopardy of creating a depression relapse i am paying attention actually , right now i'm celebrating , just a bit , that i'm able to do what i'm currently doing i 'll keep working on fitting in the other important pieces , and i 'll back off the work hours when needed i'm willing to do what 's needed to find that balance balance it 's vital to my mental health stability i'm hoping i can figure out a way to work as much as i can , while i have the opportunity to do so , while still finding time for the socialization , exercise , healthy food , and sleep i need i suppose that 's the goal of everyone , chronic illness or not
