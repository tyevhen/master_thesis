as high school counselors , we know that we are overworked and many school counseling positions are on the brink of extinction however , does our administration , colleagues , parents , and students get it ? typical day as a high school counselor my workday begins at am each day as i am walking in the door , i often have two or three students stop me to ask questions when i finally make it to my office door , someone is knocking on our main suite door to get in some mornings , we can have people stopping by , in a short period of minutes , to pick up a transcript , ask a question , complain about a class , or ask to talk to us because they got in an argument with their parent as my morning starts , i am expected to check and answer all my email immediately , answer my phone or return calls promptly , come to an administrator 's office to talk to an upset student , and address parent concerns when they walk through the door oh , do n't forget the emergency situations ! the suicidal student , the kid who is bullied on the bus , the kid who reveals that he or she was hit by a parent , or a student having a meltdown in the bathroom often by lunch , i have seen a minimum of students and parents , and made classroom calls me , most days as i enter the building forget a lunch break ! ! if i eat lunch at all , i eat while i am talking to a student i often beg his or her forgiveness or while i am running to a classroom to grab a student throughout the day , i am often working on spreadsheets of student failures , identifying who has not taken a standardized test , talking to a student who needs to take credit recovery in the evening , or encouraging a kid just to come to school by the end of the day , i can have up to three meetings sometimes all at the same time and then i have another emails to answer before i leave finally , my day ends at pm and i pour myself in my car and head to the gym for a little self care after the gym , i head home , grab a bite to eat , talk to my family , and then start making my plans for work the next day student to counselor ratio educating our stakeholders about our role as the school counselor is very important however , educating the public about the lack of school counselors is a matter of urgency ! ! in this post , i would like to share some information with high school counselors about why you should inform your staff , students , and parents about the shortage of high school counselors in our country and why our role is important although asca recommends a ratio of students per counselor , student to counselors ratios can range from to to , to in the united states and us territories see the counselor to student ratio per state chart yes , budgets are tight and everyone must make sacrifices in the school system however , educating everyone from your state legislator to future voters in your high school is critical for our existence in fact , as school counselors , we often do not market our services and benefits to students very effectively in fact , my student services director made a very profound comment at our monthly counselor meeting she said that all counselors need to do a better job at publicizing our successes every chance we get i could not agree more with her ! stop the bleeding why reduce the student to counselor ratio ? the ny times reported that a lower student to counselor ratio improves the college going culture of a school improves student success improves academic achievement so , with all the research on the effectiveness of the school counselor , why are school counselor positions being eliminated ? the answer is simply money at least that is why philadelphia let go all of its school counselors before the start of the school year however , we should never get so comfortable to think that our positions are recession proof as my high school 's counseling department chair , i am constantly watching our school enrollment for that magic enrollment number so that our school can keep all our counselors what can we do as professional school counselors to educate our stakeholders ?
