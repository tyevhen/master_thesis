here in b'more , it 's not uncommon for people to call each other hon , especially strangers so the checkout person at the grocery store may well say , have a good day , hon it 's kind of endearing so here at shrink rap we 've been discussing some difficult things going on in psychiatry major changes in the way we code appointments i 'll avoid the letter acronym we 've all come to dread and gun legislation that targets , and therefore stigmatizes , those with mental illnesses i , for one , have been among those ranting , and it 's for that reason that i have a blog i like to rant our commenters have joined me in kvetching about changes and possible changes i have to say , though , that i do n't think things are so bad , hon so i 've learned how to use the new codes and i 've learned to incorporate this into my practice so that i'm doing nothing different when i see patients , which is good , because i was worried that the new coding would force me to derail part of the session to ask questions or do things that are irrelevant to the individual patient 's care , and so far they have n't i 've computerized my progress notes , and the first couple of weeks were very painful i was in the office hours longer each day , but now i have a rhythm what still has n't been sorted out is how to code so that insurance companies will reimburse patients , and at this point it seems that some insurance companies are reimbursing significantly better , some are disallowing psychotherapy , and some do n't even have prices assigned to the codes and have all claims as pending through our state listserv , we 've engaged with the insurance commissioner 's office , and at least they know there are problems but i do think that in a few months it will just be what we do and psychiatry will move on , hopefully with sustained and improved reimbursements at this point , i still think it was a bad move to do this more paperwork with unclear gains but it is what it is and i do n't think this will be a devastating change for psychiatry if you 're still confused , my youtube tutorials have had over views , and when once it falls out as to what insurers will reimburse , i may do a quick and easy synopsis regarding upcoming legislation , i remain annoyed at the quick response of our legislators i 've rejoined our psychiatric society 's legislative committee , and i wrote an op ed piece in our local paper one commenter noted they did n't think it would do any good , but i remain optimistic that these efforts have some meaning of course , no one wins all the time in going against a system , but last year clink and i wrote a joint op ed piece opposing legislation to make marijuana legal , it was run the day the legislature voted , and it was defeated when my op ed piece ran last week discussing why it 's a bad idea to mandate that psychiatrists report patients , i got a lot of emails , including one from one of the governor 's appointees asking how i thought the firearms bill should be changed i may not win on my issues , but i'm planning to go down making a lot of noise , and i'm not at all hopeless and if you have a cause or an issue , please , please do something people who say you ca n't fight the system , do n't fight the system it 's not always fun and it 's not always gratifying , but at least you can say you tried and you might just make a difference at the end of the day , i still like my job , hon
