the mozilla labs crew continues to put a surprising amount of muscle behind jetpack i note with interest that mozilla is looking to hire an engineer http ly ic and a pm http ly uf specifically to work on jetpack the fact that mozilla is creating two new positions in this economy , especially tells me they 're committed to the jetpack project it 's not just a forgive me fly by night affair in addition , i think it 's interesting that mozilla labs recently announced a jetpack liftoff code contest , which ends october , the grand prize winner will receive an asus eee pc he black netbook computer arv the runner up prize winner will receive stickers and a t shirt arv version of jetpack is set to hit tomorrow night , with a labs blog about it the following morning more exciting to me personally is the fact that the api has expanded significantly i wo n't run through any of the new methods here even though i know you 're dying to hear about them in excruciating detail right this minute , but you can sneak a peek at the doc here it will be interesting to see what comes out of the contest jetpack is at a pivotal point in its career right now it badly needs a killer app it 's kill or be killed , in the browser world , and frankly the world does n't want for apis at this point so it behooves mozlabs to slam dunk this one if it were me , i would have upped the ante and made the grand prize for the code contest a little grander a real jetpack it does n't say much to give away a netbook , imho at the very least , give away a fully tricked out powerbook and maybe a claw hammer signed by icet but then , what do i know about running a contest ? i barely know which end of the claw hammer to pound the keyboard with
