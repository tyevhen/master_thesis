i often find myself thinking things are impossible , but that 's not always the case too often than not i find myself looking back on past events and wondering how it was even possible for such things to occur almost as if some these events were a blessing in disguise such as one of my idols turning up at my house randomly one day because a family member wrote a letter explaining what a big fan my mum was or meeting a person at university who i am so well matched with and whom has been through similar to me and is understanding or that i have survived serious episodes of depression there is no way that any ordinary person would argue these things to be possible , extremely unlikely at the very most it gives me a new perspective one which life is magical , where things are possible , and things do happen when you least expect it there are just some moments in life , where things cannot be comprehended and where it blows your mind even thinking about it things which make me think that perhaps some things could come true , which otherwise i would never believe in before i start becoming or philosophical , i better stop ! i just think it 's important to note that sometimes a weird twist of fate is all it takes to turn your life around one second too early , too late or a random event and it changes the view that things are just black as they are white keep it in mind amy xx
