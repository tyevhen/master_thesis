this morning my mind is dulled for reasons unknown , possibly by the new medication thus i did not compose a sonnet for sonnet sunday , for which i apologize in its stead i wrote my first snippet of free verse in two months here it is the missing tappeta tappeta , rain on the skylight mouthfuls of drops thread the forest like spores , pearl my windows no light but gray light no light but the sky painted in primer diffusing down to the roots of trunks in a mist of dull silver where are the birds ? despite my mood impairment i enjoyed thanksgiving immensely because all three of my daughters and my grandson were there writing the word grandson has a strange effect on me does n't it imply something about my age ? the love of my daughters lifted me up they alternately hung on my arm as we toured haight ashbery and fisherman 's wharf our bond is strong when i returned home yesterday i cried because i missed them already afterwards we watched rushmore , a movie my brother bought me for my birthday we did n't get the movie , though my brother and daughters are enamored of it i saw no change in character in the protagonist , no crises that changed his outlook , although near the end he accepts a more realistic goal in obtaining a girlfriend than trying to get laid by a teacher naturally the interruption in my blog was due to the holiday i can only wish that others had as sweet a thanksgiving as i i was surrounded by the people i most love , including my siblings kathleen said it was good to see me laugh i was skating on love i will try to hold on to that thanks for stopping by , ce
