i recently read almost a psychopath by ronald schouten , md , jd and james silver , jd both authors have extensive experience working with psychopaths and almost psychopaths according to schouten and silver , people who are almost psychopaths are individuals who do n't quite meet the full criteria for being a psychopath in their book , they discuss in details how we can distinguish between the two , and they give many examples of people who are almost psychopaths as a therapist who meets many different clients , it was fascinating to read about how common almost psychopaths are according to schouten and silver , they are all around us more importantly , they discuss what you can do if you are with someone who is almost a psychopath or if you recognize yourself to be in this category one important difference between a psychopath and someone who is almost a psychopath has to do with empathy someone who meets the full diagnostic criteria for being a psychopath lacks empathy for the people that he or she hurts if this is a topic that interests you , either because you 're with someone who displays psychopathic tendencies or you think you might be psychopathic yourself , i recommend that you read almost a psychopath , which is an informative and interesting read i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist who works with individual adults and couples my specialities include dynamic talk therapy , clinical hypnosis , emdr , and somatic experiencing to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at
