i had a really good weekend of workouts and relaxation my calf is still sore i had a painful deep massage thursday evening , but i felt better friday , so i guess the pain was worth it it feels like my calf is slowly improving yesterday i did n't even attempt to run i swam miles instead i was really proud of myself i planned to swim one mile , rest , and then swim another half mile i felt okay at the one mile mark , so i thought i 'd just do a few more laps before resting well , before i knew it , i had my sights set on finishing the whole distance , and i did ! it was tough , as i have n't swum that far in an awful long time , but i finished it it was a good substitute for the mile run i had scheduled today i spent the entire morning with friends bill and cindy they just returned from a coastal vacation , so i had n't seen them in over a week we hung out in the beautiful morning sunshine , drank coffee , chatted , laughed , and then went out for lunch it was lovely i so appreciate them , and i am so happy they are in my life after lunch i took a very restful nap then i headed out for today 's workout i rode miles on a local bike trail i rode hard it 's a relatively flat trail i averaged almost miles per hour , and i was happy with that it was gorgeous , perfect weather for a ride i'm pleasantly tired right now , but i still need to take my boy for a walk that will be a nice end to a very nice day my mood continues to be good the mental health stability certainly is nice physically , i think i will be okay for my marathon this weekend , as it feels like my calf is healing and of course i'm looking forward to seeing d again we will spend the weekend at his home , as the race is not far from where he lives i'm looking forward to another good weekend ahead have a great week everyone !
