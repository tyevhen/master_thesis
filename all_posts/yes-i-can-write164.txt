i 've wanted to have a blog button for a while now i mean , they 're just cool , are n't they ? so with the help of my sister emi who actually knows how to use photoshop i we made one , and with the help of this ehow article , i actually managed to put it in the sidebar with a nifty code box so that you can copy the html and stick it on your own blog site ! if you feel so inclined , of course here it is ! if you have a blogger blog , all you need to do is go to layout , then add gadget , choose the hmtl box , and paste the code below into the box provided voila ! i'm assuming other blog platforms have a similar gadget center a href http yes i can write blogspot com img border src http lh ggpht com menbunhi tkuajmunyi aaaaaaaachm jray xrjvk idzie s blog button small jpg a center p s notice how the pictures are supposed to represent unschooling , vegetarianism , animism , green anarchy , and hippie ism i figured that was a good way to do things ! also , if you notice any problems with it or if you think the size of the button should be changed , please let me know so i can fix it thanks a bunch ! ! you might also like happy st birthday to this blog ! a list of blogs by teenage and grown unschoolers emi 's new blog , and changes to this blog ! yet another new blog linkwithin
