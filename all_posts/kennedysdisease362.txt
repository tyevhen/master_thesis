it has been another good month my every other day exercise program averaged minutes my short program the light days averaged minutes i find myself having to cut back on the number of reps i am doing because they have become so easy that i could go on for another minutes without a problem i am sure muscle memory plays a part in this factor i keep on wondering if this is the placebo effect , but the longer i feel this way the more i tend to discount it because it has lasted eight months i continue to keep my dutasteride journal and hope to review it with my doctor in december he is most interested in how things are going when i woke up last thursday morning i noticed a weakness more than normal in my right arm all day the weakness was evident fortunately , when i woke up friday morning the arm was back to normal also , i noticed during my long exercise routine that the right arm was actually stronger than normal go figure ! the neck weakness i wrote about back in may has not reappeared the week of the weakness had me concerned , but fortunately it was just another kennedy s disease anomaly and , still no apparent side effects fall is in the air and my next challenge will be how i hold up this winter the cold is tough on me especially my four walks a day with fred , my beagle i already have the hand warmers out because morning temperatures will be in the high s by wednesday i ll take it one day at a time and hope that things continue to go well
