there is a story in today s paper about an alleged killer who murdered four police officers in seattle here is someone who is a career criminal and who should have been in jail for the rest of his life i ll skip the details , which can be found in all major newspapers this is a criminal with violent tendencies given freedom time after time , including being released by governor mike huckabee why did that happen ? ah , that is the question mostly because baptist preachers often demand clemency for those who say that they see the light and have gone straight and who have found god you cannot get out of jail if you haven t found that imaginary guy who sees all huckabee , who is so religious he doesn t believe in evolution , listens to those preachers so what is it about them ? well , first of all , they all believe in forgiveness and redemption and then they believe in what people say and worse , they don t believe in science i mean , after all , if you don t believe in one of the greatest scientific discoveries in history what are you doing on this planet ? recently scientists voted that evolution was one of the greatest discoveries in all of science but the governor doesn t listen to science he listens to the forgivers , which is nice if you are talking about your mother but not about a killer lacking access to good sense and feeling they believe the words of psychopaths who use those words to deceive and they deceive those self deceivers because it is easy and to be good christians they want to forgive and believe that psychopaths turn good , which they don t if you don t see how people evolve what do you see ? a static , unchanging world that is very predictable except when it isn t if you want to eschew forgiveness i have an idea i do not forgive governor huckabee for being gullible , stupid and in effect , criminal because he let loose a dangerous maniac onto us being forgiving makes us feel that we are so good but the result , as we see , is immoral and so why didn t huckabee listen to scientists and specialists in the field ? simple he doesn t believe in science he believes in religion , and how many crimes are committed in the name of religion besides psychologic science , as i see it , is a failure
