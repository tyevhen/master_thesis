can i give up looking for someone without giving up hope i will find someone and the dreams of a family ? i am gong to start looking for a flat to buy , i am gving my notice on the long term savings tomorrow i want to stay in the town i am in now , and still quite central i decided to sell my car a few weeks ago after it cost me another on sevicing it is worth about , this would really give a little more towards a flat i think having my own place with a small garden would allow me to make a home again i also like gardening and just sitting outside so two hobbies in one there living in rented accomodation just never feels the same not being able to customise the decor i think i will just concentrate on loving the friends i already have i just do n't think i have any really close friends the only person i have ever been close to is my ex i do have more aquaintence type friends to pass the time of day with ever before i chat to people on the bus and go for coffee with colleagues there just is n't really much outside work i love my job though and that is my life i ca n't imagine feeling so forfilled and stimulated outside work as i do at work work does tend to send me hypo a lot of the time though i need quiet time outside of work to reset my mood i think i could forget about looking for mr right if i had my own home to give my life outside work some meaning i could start to build a future and start imagining my future alone i really struggle to do this at the moment i could cncentrate on improving the quality of my home i also have my career where i love the people i work with not sure they would ever want to see me outside working hours though i have tried looking for mr right but i thinkit is time to start imagining a future alone i never used to be able to think about that but it is starting to get easier now buying a flat seems to be within my reach tomorrow i go to the bank to give notice on my savings , i am alsogoing to register with a few estate agents a part of me feels sad that i am commiting to a life alone for at least a few more years it feels like a big step
