i chose to write this blog anonymously because i did n't want my thesis adviser to read it and get mad i also do n't want any of the people who are in charge of keeping me on track i e the few friends who do n't try to tempt me with beer and good times to know how off track i just may be so i have taken the reasonable precautions of withholding my name and using a fake picture kudos to anybody who can tell who the picture is of thesis progress of pages written that 's only for chapter , the full thesis is much longer
