so i'm walking with max and we pass a little office with a little sign , a woman 's name , some initials , and below that body centered psychotherapy huh ? what does that mean ? it 's about the psyche , not the body , unless , i guess it 's a treatment for body dysmorphic disorder , or maybe something body related in the delusional realm ? somehow , i do n't think so seems it googles to it 's own flavor of mental healthdom , but no psychiatrists max was game
