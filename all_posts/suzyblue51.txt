soap and glory , is in my opinion , quite an underrated brand i 've tried out a few of their products over the past few months and have yet to be disappointed so when it was time to buy a new mascara , i was excited to see that this one was recommended to me by a few of you on twitter at , my first thought was that it was a bit pricey for a ml mascara , considering their show good face foundation primer is for a ml tube but none the less , i needed a new mascara so bought it anyway ! soap and glory boast that their sided fan flare brush with a v groove lays down volume intensity , and a network of combing curling surfaces give length , definition and drama to lashes furthermore , strength building collagen pre peptides and long stretch polymers wrap lashes in a flexible , lengthening film for no flake all day wear technology all sounds very exciting does n't it ? with all the hype , i was dying to give this product a try , however , i was left feeling disappointed the mascara does lengthen and lift my lashes and makes my eyes appear more open but thats about it ! it 's staying power is good , i was pleased to notice that the product stays put all day and does n't flake off but i was really expecting more from such a hyped up product i mean , the mascara is n't bad , but it does n't wow me and i definitely feel it 's not worth i did notice however , if i curl my lashes before and after applying this product , they do appear significantly longer and lifted all in all , this product is ok , but i'm unsure if i will be repurchasing if i had to rate it , i 'd give this mascara a maybe i should have just stuck to my beloved maybelline the falsies whats your favourite mascara , can anyone recommend a good one for when mine runs out ? until next time , stay classy suz x related posts fotd mini tutorial kylie jenner suzyblue a year in pictures suzyblue i want what she's wearing croatian inspiration suzyblue review rimmel stay matte foundation suzyblue things i 've learned in years suz
