this week i was as shocked as everyone else after learning about the plane being shot down over ukraine as a nervous person and someone with a history of a fear of flying , i responded to the tragedy perhaps more severely than many people my imagination was on fire , as we say in recovery i fly frequently , and i found myself wondering what it must have been like for those tragic souls onboard that flight i talked to several co workers about my fear of flying i was working myself up into a frenzy i soon realized that in order to protect my mental health , i would need to distance myself from the news coverage avoiding hearing more about the tragedy will be difficult in the coming weeks , but i ve decided to not focus on or obsess over the situation i acknowledged that talking about my fear of flying with my co workers did nothing but upset me i got goose bumps , my eyes became blurry , and my breathing became shallow these symptoms are average for me after an airline disaster and , to put the situation in perspective , i don t have them often , as such tragedies are quite rare i m also providing myself with secure thoughts , acknowledging how exponentially safer flying is than driving , for example i can t control my feelings and sensations , but i certainly can control my thoughts and impulses flying is part of my job there s no way to avoid it , and i wouldn t want to i enjoy seeing new places and meeting new people this rare tragedy is causing me discomfort , but through my recovery training i am able to put such feelings into perspective my heart goes out to the families of the victims , but obsessing over the situation will certainly not help anyone
