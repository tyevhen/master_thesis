a quick note to say thank you to everyone who commented on my last post i was feeling conflicted about continuing to write because i 've been doing so much better than when i started this blog a few years ago many of you said , much to my surprise , that 's exactly why you read because i'm doing better , and doing better offers you hope ! i had never thought of that ! my therapist would be proud of you for re framing my negative thought into a positive one really , she would ! so thank you all for your feedback i am humbled and amazed by your support it is certainly no coincidence , i think , that i 've gotten progressively better since i began this blog this blog proves when we help one another , we are helped ourselves since i need all the help i can get , i 'll keep writing
