i started to comment on dinah 's post , entitled that 's entertainment ? ? ? , about reality tv shows exploiting folks with mental illness , and my comment turned into this new post i have come to the following reasoned conclusion ahem i am quite certain that at some point , soon , there will be a reality therapy show more likely an internet video log , or vlog you know , a webcam in your office , for the world to see what happens in therapy bringing the couch into your living room every tuesday evening from , for example , melissa can be seen talking with her therapist live god forbid if she 's late , as the shrink would then look into the cam , telling why he thinks she 's acting out because of the interpretation he offered the previous week , and her troubles confronting authority figures maybe even with video snippets from prior sessions , driving home the point i'm sure if you miss a session , or show , you can download it to your ipod from itunes , and watch it when your patient no shows , all the while wishing that you could have a successful therapy vlog , like dr pheel has some patients will even develop their own following , like groupies , cheering their successes on , or jeering at the more narcissistic or annoying clients i suppose if there are advertising sponsors , then the therapy would be free for the patient , and the therapist would reap some financial benefit perhaps google ads popping up on either side of the screen , at the mere mention of a product or service by the doctor or patient sponsored links toxic waste weight cleanse the waste weight and lose more pounds and inches www puristat com doc , ever since i started taking the paxil , i 've gained so much weight and i 've been constipated it 's really depressing sponsored links constipation gone forever read about the natural remedy for constipation it works ! www drnatura com netizens would flock to the patients' blogs to see what they are really thinking between sessions , leaving comments about how insensitive the shrink is or how she should let go of the idea that her bitch of a mother will ever care about anyone but herself or about how she is such a misandrist or , he , a negative animus or that her iatrist is using the wrong otropic drug or that she could become a clear if she just joined the org or maybe even that , for the low price of just , in four easy installments , that she , too , could have her very own emotional support duck , thus , forever doing away with the perverse dependency on her work a day psychiatrist it would get people interested in therapy again , like in the 's , but only more tricked out and jazzed up for the plugged in generation who needs insurance ? if your problems are interesting enough , or bizarre enough , all you need is a therapy sponsor if you are willing to try out the latest pharmaceutical , the drug company may even sponsor your reality therapy vlog , though probably with a side contract stating that for a given sum of money you will not divulge any unpleasant reactions you might experience , such as a blue tint to your vision , spontaneous flatulence , or painful erections lasting longer than hours or inches some day soon , this year or next , web enabled therapeutic voyeurism dubbed psychotherapy will become the biggest thing to hit psychotherapy since managed care or prozac or even freud
