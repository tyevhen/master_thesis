it 's been several weeks since the zine came out , and i 've loved getting such great feedback on it ! but it 's occured to me that the info for it on this blog is very scattered and rather hard to find so , i gave it it 's own website ! go check it out here please do i 'd love to hear your opinions on the site , information you think i should add , and stuff like that this also gave me an excuse to play around with wordpress , something i 've been wanting to do for a while ! i 've considered moving this blog over to wordpress , since there are a lot of features missing from blogger that wordpress has , but so far i 've decided not to either way , i enjoyed setting up the site for diy life zine ! the link to that site can now be found permanently on this blog in the list at the top of the sidebar peace , idzie you might also like first ever issue of diy life zine now available ! ! diy life zine looking for submissions for issue ! diy life zine table of contents zine reminder linkwithin
