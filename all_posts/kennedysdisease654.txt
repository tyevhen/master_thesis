in , i posted an article on gratitude in the article , i mentioned using a gratitude journal to help recognize moments that you are grateful for since then , i mentioned the gratitude journal three other times i use the journal several times a day to recognize all the good in my life i have always felt i am a positive person , but there are still times when griping and venting is just too easy of an outlet today i read an article by david cain on radical gratitude it takes the notion of being grateful to a completely new level the idea sounds ridiculous , and even hopeless , but in practice it s quite easy , and immediately rewarding you just ask yourself , can i be grateful for this too ? in my short experience doing this , the brain has a way of coming up with good reasons why yes , you can this practice reveals a lot about our shortsightedness we have a rather ridiculous tendency to believe everything is either strictly good for us or bad for us , and that we can reliably determine which one it is , in the instant that thing happens i would encourage you to read the article by mr cain i plan to implement the idea and see what happens in fact , this afternoon , something happened that i wasn t too happy about the minute i noticed my feelings of this is bad , i commented , wow , i am grateful for this happening because just saying that changed my disposition , and , in turn , my outlook on the event i will probably fail several times a day trying to implement this new radical way of viewing my world , but failure isn t so bad it opens the door to a greater understanding of what works and what doesn t work yet , the idea is so contrarian as to how i currently operate , it will be interesting to see the results photo http everydaygyaan com
