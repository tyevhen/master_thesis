frank yeah , and to this day i ache to be touched just ache and they wouldn t touch me , they didn t want it to get infected of course they weren t touchy people anyway , so that was dr aj were they very religious ? frank no i was when i was a child boy , i used to pray every night now i lay me down to sleep , i pray the lord my soul to keep , please let me die before i wake , and please , dear god , my soul you ll take i used to pray to die every night dr aj gee , your life was miserable can you imagine a life like that ? david back to your point , coherence coherence was a problem organization was a problem time management is a problem dr aj ok , how about organization ? david again , pressure inside is just blowing the gates , and blowing cohesion blowing all neurological cohesion to shreds there s no cohesion of gating frank the pressure disorganizes you dr aj so the leaky gates don t allow you to co david come together dr aj so what does this have to do with leaky gates ? frank you are stopping the leaks from coming up ? david that is a good metaphor it s like the body it s whole function is going to stop the leaks the leaky gates and try to give it cohesion and it s failing right ? ken it s true , but there is another element for me a lot of times it s that i don t care i don t care enough to organize something i don t care about anything a lot of the time , except finding some kind of peace or connection to myself inside , you know , getting dr aj that s the whole story david i can understand that ken it s like i finally can cry and then it s all this is me , and now i finally feel right i was going to say that turning to david you were saying something about always being bad or something for me i ve always had this unconscious feeling that i m bad , or not right or something until it finally connects a connected feeling , and then it s , oh , yeah , this is me it finally feels right and it s very rare too dr aj it sounds like a nightmare david dr aj talks about having cohesion in therapy and having connected feelings i understand that , and i can see it in my patients when they have a connected feeling and see the difference but , i don t know how to explain it but there s a part of me that says , i don t give a damn about a connected feeling , as long as i m connected to the crying and the hurt it s almost like i don t care what it s about and it s not like an abreacted disconnected feeling , it s just that some of that pressure that gets put out from me it s like worth a million bucks , when you go through a lifetime of near crying and nobody gets it and you get pounded and pounded , and then they sit you down and say , what are your goals in life ? and you just sit there and part of you feels bad because you don t have any and you know that you should and you can t , but a secret part of you just wants to say fuck you ! go to hell ! don t talk to me about goals dr aj because ? david it s been hard enough to get here it s been hard enough to get through life up to this point dr aj no goals david goals , goals , what are goals ? frank wow , i ve always had goals but one of the things in my life was that when i got to a certain age well , everybody my age was supposed to do that so why don t you ? well , nobody ever taught me and each thing i remember the first the first primal i ever had about that not being able to do things that i m supposed to do it started out with my writing that i couldn t get published and the feeling went right down to when i was sitting on the toilet saying mama , mama , come and wipe me i m done and her saying , you re old enough to wipe yourself , now do it ! but nobody ever taught me how and now i m supposed to know how , because i m old enough to know how and it was the same way and the big thing that triggered it was when i was first married , my gramma called me up and said , uncle rex said you could buy his house , so you guys can have a nice house i m going to take you to the bank and get all the paperwork done and i went with her the next day to the bank , and i sat down there that was the first time i d ever been in an office in the bank and i sat down there , and just before the bank manager came in , gramma says , this is your loan , now you have to handle it yourself i didn t even know what an escrow was and the thing is that i was qualified to get the loan with the gi bill but i didn t know that shrugs dr aj so they don t educate you , either they don t talk to you frank they hung me out to dry dr aj when i tell my friends that when i was young my parents never said anything to me they sent me away for three years , well they never said you are going to so and so , they just packed my bags and i was off they don t talk to you motions to david is that true with you ? that s bizarre isn t it ? david i remember asking my dad , you said you were in the army , dad , what did you do ? none of your business dad , how old are you ? none of your business what s insurance dad ? none of your business dr aj so what should be the cure for this ? i m curious , you said the program helped you you saw the program ? david it didn t help me , help me it gave me a little bit like they understand what i go through that s about it but they don t really understand it frank how do you deal with add ? you go to primal therapy one of the biggest gains i made it was just so funny and i remember telling you about it motions to david you get this little feeling and it goes motions with finger tips together , and shifts them slightly click but it affects everything my inner core just went click a change in attitude , and that s when i stopped beating up on myself it had been a heavy session and david had just said i m not going to let you come in here and beat up on yourself anymore and i thought he was in his shit dr aj what david he thought when i said that , that i was in my shit frank cause he seemed harsh and that s the only time i d ever seen him harsh dr aj right frank but the next day it was just like god , i don t need to beat up on myself i don t deserve this david and i don t want to get too close to someone and i never can trust them and i remember this particular day just after a feeling , shrugs nothing ok , i just had a feeling , and walking out the door , and walking down the street , and walking among people and not feeling that fear , that anxiety and it was like oh , my god , this must be what my life could have been and i had to take pause it was like where s the fear ? it was quite an eye opener dr aj you too , ken ? ken oh , yeah , i mean i ll just have moments when i have a feeling and really feel connected it s just like a moment of grace it s like i m here and i m not scared , and i m not wrong or anything dr aj you live with it all your life and most of the time you re not aware of it that s just you ken yeah and then those moments are gone well , that was something but i can hardly talk about it then it s gone and it s like , i think there s something there i think there s something better dr aj it s funny , huh and primal principle you don t feel unloved until you get some love in the present , then you can go back and feel unloved otherwise , you carry it around with you until you die back to what you were saying , frank frank i was talking about the feelings i was having in that session when david told me i couldn t beat up on myself and as i remember it was a lot of feelings about my whole family beating up on me literally , my brother used to beat me until i was unconscious sometimes dr aj and the parents do nothing , right ? frank oh , they d say shaking his finger at dr aj now you d better stop doing that when i got my eye put out and the doctor said i couldn t have any jars to my head , they d say , now if you hit frank , you d better make sure you hit him on the arm and not in the face or the head anymore he can t take any jars to his head and my dad would say , so help me god , i ll tie your head down in brackets , so it doesn t move when i beat you dr aj it s amazing , isn t it ? well , listen guys , we ve got to have staff meeting ken let me say one quick thing , back to the outlet , and me not being add i don t think one other thing , when i was a kid it was all physical , like the sports , and i was one of those kids with a lot of tics i d just be going nuts with tics histrionics , i was all over the place so it came out physically for me dr aj yeah , it got channeled into his body frank yeah , i d have said that s an adhd thing david i never experienced tics like that , but i remember a session years and years ago that dr aj did for me in the middle of the feeling i was going towards the birthing , and my eye started to tic involuntarily , and it just kept ticking and ticking it was just the weirdest thing ken mine were voluntary , mine were voluntary it was just something that i had to do like i could make myself not do it but i felt like i had to do it frank like flexing your muscles ken i would make it happen david oh , you would ken yeah , i do it now even sometimes not as much though , and i try to hide it as much as i can when i was a kid it was a lot more exaggerated demonstrating david well , what does it do for you ? ken i don t know , it s just something i have to do it s some sort of tension outlet or something frank it s like an isometric thing you stretch the muscles so you can relax them ken yeah , they were all over the place david i have a similar thing dr aj you don t have that david oh , you ll see me in staff meeting sometimes and my eyes will go like that and my facial expressions i think it s similar to what you re talking about i think it s just a little discharge of that pressure or tension or something then talk of the business mechanics of the meetings finally dr aj turns to frank dr aj was it elucidating ? frank oh , yeah , it was particularly elucidating listening to david realizing he had real experience of what i go through dr aj he s a classic add , a classic it wasn t until he was with me that i encouraged him to go to school he didn t think he could learn he was sure he couldn t learn david yeah , that and i just didn t want to go through the nightmare of it and go put myself back into that frank i was really afraid when i started and when i found myself competing with these young girls there were of us in the class and of them were girls they were young girls , and a lot of them already had their masters in something else and they were all the scholars of the school and how the hell did i get chosen to be in this group ? of course , thank you , and i also got a lift from joseph wambaugh dr aj of course i was also a severe add and i could barely make it out of high school and couldn t concentrate much and what happened was , when i joined the navy they gave you intelligence tests and i forgot about it because i had no intention of going to college but one day when we were on our way to okinawa and saipan we were on a ship we d had seven battles already and were on to our th battle then a destroyer pulls up and says we re taking janov off the battleship and taking him back to officers preflight school , because my iq which i had taken years before was very high so on the way to a battle , which is serious shit lot of kamikazes then when i went to school , i got straight a s and i thought you know what ? i can do this i could feel my brain change the end
