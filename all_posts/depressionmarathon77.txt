it 's hard to imagine feeling much lower than i do right now i just survived the longest weekend i 've endured in quite some time , and today did n't get much better i do n't know how otherwise to explain it i'm just low i'm tearful , tired , and unmotivated i ca n't shake my lethargy and gloom i'm not sure being cooped up in the hospital is helping , as i think i 'd at least be able to get out for a short walk if i was home but all my friends and my doctor think the hospital is where i need to be right now they 're probably right i do n't like it , but it 's safe i tried biking gently last night , but i only survived minutes my energy is as low as my mood i began a new medication last night which is intended to augment the ect i hope it works i'm not sure how much deeper i can sink i'm getting nervous i'm getting anxious about how long this depression relapse is going to last i'm worried about my job , especially i do n't know that my current position is at all guaranteed being a non benefited employee , i do n't believe my employer is under any obligation to hold my position i know they are scrambling to find someone to fulfill my duties hopefully , i 'll have a job to return to when i start feeling better i feel awful about leaving my coworkers short handed and scrambling i work in rural communities , and it 's difficult to find coverage i called my boss to check in today , but she was n't available , and she never returned my call i'm not sure that 's a good sign ! of course , everyday i miss work is another day of missed earnings that 's beginning to get more and more stressful , too i'm really not sure how i'm going to pay my bills i had hoped to be feeling better and back to earning a living by now instead , it looks like it will be quite some time before i collect another paycheck and there you have it my many tales of woe this is a tough one i pray something changes soon i would give my right arm to feel just a tiny bit of improvement i appreciate your prayers and words of encouragement i 'll keep putting one foot in front of the other as best i can
