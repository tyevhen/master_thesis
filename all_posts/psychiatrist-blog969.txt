people see shrinks for a variety of reasons these days , i think people come mostly for treatment of psychiatric disorders also called mental illnesses like depression , bipolar disorder , anxiety , schizophrenia but people come for other reasons sometimes they have personality styles that are n't working for them , or they have behaviors that they troublesome , like drinking too much or using drugs or gambling some people want to understand themselves better and use therapy for this purpose others need help coping with major losses or stresses most of these issues do fall under the categories of psychiatric disorders so someone with a maladaptive personality disorder or a behavioral problem will fit into a diagnostic category , but with respect to the types of treatments offer , there are n't medicines for all of these , and in some cases , therapy gets a bigger role so if you 've seen a psychiatrist , i 'll ask why i 'll have more questions later thank you for participating why do or did you see a shrink ? for treatment of a mood , anxiety , or psychotic disorder for trouble controlling specific behaviors for problems with personality for being stuck in an uncomfortable place in life for insight or education for help dealing with a loss or big stress to better relate to the shrink rappers other vote view results polldaddy com
