i was talking to my med school roommate last night she 's a regular doctor , and she was talking about how they need more psychiatrists where she works they 're getting a new one soon , but he scratches his chin and he sounds a little twitchy someone said something about psychiatrists being weird my friend said , i know a normal psychiatrist i asked her who , and she said you meaning me i'm normal ? roy likes that people say we sound like normal people when they listen to our my three shrinks podcast roy actually looks like a normal person clinkshrink looks like a nun i do n't want to know what i look like there are moments when i think i'm normal when patients ask me if they 're normal , i generally respond what 's normal ? actually , i think i equate normal with boring maybe normal people equate normal with sane ? most days , i'm pretty sure i'm sane , i'm positive that clinkshrink is sane , and roy oh , roy is sane and he even looks like a normal person so does psychiatry make people abnormal or are abnormal people attracted to psychiatry ? let 's try a few , feel free to add some of your own thoughts people are often attracted to fields relevant to their own lives , so they are more likely to be interested in psychiatry if they have a mental illness or know someone with a mental illness with the lifetime incidence of mental illness above , i'm not sure this accounts for weird and many of my patients easily meet criteria for normal person this is the obvious response to why shrinks are weird , so it 's where i started one gets a little bonkers listening to people 's problems all day maybe i still enjoy it everyone knows shrinks are weird , so weird people join the club i'm not sure how this explains the nun amongst us psychiatrists analyze everything and all that introspection makes you relate strangely to other people there are probably some variants on this theme it may account for unusual interpersonal styles , but not for chin scratching and twitchy ness twitchy people ca n't hold scalpels steadily so they have to be psychiatrists good point so do 'normal people' have blogs ? and i still have to comment on clinkshrink 's last post coming soon
