i have a pretty exciting , scary , and overwhelming project i 've just recently decided to take on for a while now , i 've thought it would be great to have a freedom based education unschooling and freeschooling , basically conference here , and so i 've decided to go past the thinking about stage and onto the actually doing it stage ! so i 've been brainstorming with a couple of people , have sent a call out for people interested in helping organize and run this event , and am just generally getting the ball rolling ! in some ways , it seems a pretty strange decision to make , seeing as the slump i was in for a couple weeks after getting back from smug was caused largely by my feeling overwhelmed but i know it 's the right thing to do , because as soon as i decided i was going to go through with it , my mood lifted and i just felt so free and happy ! i feel like i'm exactly where i'm supposed to be write now so it 's exciting but yes , still most definitely scary ! i do n't have much to add to that , though i do want to apologize for having neglected this blog a lot lately inspiration will hit again soon , i hope , and until then you have a few updates on my goings on as well as a couple more exciting guest posts to look forward to ! peace , idzie p s if you 're local and want to help out with this conference , or at the very least find out more , please send me an email at open eyed slave gmail com and if you 're further away but have ideas or experience to share , i 'd also be very happy to hear from you ! you might also like freedom based education conference outline the summer montreal unschoolers gathering a lovely outing and more info on smug unschooling , blogging , visions of the future some clarifications linkwithin
