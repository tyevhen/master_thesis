i 've been home for hours , and i wish i could say everything was cruising along without a hitch , but i ca n't the truth is i 've been struggling within a few hours of getting home last night , i was struggling anxious , down , hopeless i could n't believe it the feelings were intense , and the screwed up thinking soon chimed in i had to call on several people for support i was so disappointed and deflated by how i was feeling i knew i was n't one hundred percent better when i left the hospital , but i was n't expecting to feel so bad so soon like i said , i was incredibly disappointed the disillusionment continued today i had a long list of things to do in order to get ready for boston one by one , i crossed them off , but i struggled with my mood throughout using some of the techniques i learned in the hospital , i kept putting one foot in front of the other during a phone call with my psychologist , she commended me for moving forward despite how i was feeling yes , i moved but why , i wondered , did the path have to be so cluttered with crap ? ! i 'd like to say everything is great i 'd like to report i 've handled my struggles perfectly i ca n't , and i wo n't i'm frustrated with the intensity of my emotions i'm discouraged by my thoughts i'm worried about continuing to handle the crap this illness dumps on me but i'm moving forward one step at a time as difficult as this is as frustrating and useless as it feels i 've got to go on i'm afraid , again , of being worn down by the demon depression , but i'm trying not to think about that after all , i'm having enough trouble just dealing with today but i will i will
