in all the hand wringing discussions about xml 's verbosity that i 've read over the years , i have yet to hear anyone suggest simply truncating all closing tags to in other words , if you 've got data item something item data why not just shorten it to data item something verbose closing tags are a pure waste of space albeit required by xml spec abbreviated closing tags do n't make the file any less parsable when the parser encounters it knows that the closure is at the nesting level of the previous opening tag if not , the xml was not well formed to begin with verbose closing tags are just that unneeded verbosity
