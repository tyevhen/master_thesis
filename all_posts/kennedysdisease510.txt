this is another article from abc news concerning the ekso bionic suit i have written about the ekso before april and september the reason i continue to write about these new technologies in personal mobility is the advancements that are being made at a significant rate none of these robotic bionic assists are perfect yet , but they are getting closer and prices will come down until these assists become affordable one of the key features that i have not seen before is that the weight of the actual bionic suit is transferred to the ground so the user doesn t have to carry the additional weight yes , we aren t there yet , but we are getting a lot closer something like this will make living with kennedy 's disease a little easier until there is a treatment or cure patients paralyzed by spinal cord injuries are taking their precious first steps at a southern california hospital with the help of a battery powered bionic suit that was first designed to help soldiers carry heavy loads mentally it s a wonderful feeling to be upright and moving , said aaron bloom , who was paralyzed two years ago in an accident the year old was told he would never walk again , but with each step in the ekso bionic suit at huntington memorial hospital , he s defying the odds right now , i don t really need anybody holding me i can lift my hands up and put a little weight on these crutches and feel pretty comfortable , he said the suit , which costs , , is strapped on over a person s clothes foot plate sensors help locate the center of gravity so the person wearing the suit can maintain their balance as they take each step a computer is worn on the back to help drive the hip and knee motors the entire suit weighs pounds , but the load is transferred to the ground so the patient does not bear the weight , according to ekso bionics , the company behind the breakthrough technology it took bloom weeks of practice to feel comfortable using the suit he knows it s not a perfect solution , but for now , it is hope i have no doubt in my lifetime that there will be some sort of solution for spinal cord injuries , he said i firmly believe that i will be able to walk in the future it s just a matter of time
