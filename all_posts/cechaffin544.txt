yesterday was a tearful day , tears without reference , just a chemical sadness knowing that it 's chemical does n't make it any better , although it does help with intellectual hope i had made up my mind that when kathleen got home from work i would go fishing i am the world 's unluckiest fisherman , and i never catch anything , but i like the process so there i was , above a beautiful blue cove on a bluff , tossing my bait and i teared up and started crying i 've never cried while fishing before it 's some kind of a low mark , i think i recall the thought i had before i started to weep i had thought of god briefly , and began to offer a limp prayer when the idea of contact with god made me unutterably sad given the christian conception i 've inherited , it makes sense , because often the most painful thing in a serious depression is contact with those closest to you there are no words to express the depths of worthlessness one feels when confronted by love , because one can neither appreciate love nor reciprocate i did n't cry when i woke today i attribute this to the increased dose of zyprexa i took last night the bad thing is that i did n't move in my sleep because of the dosage , so i woke with pain in my left hip and the capsulitis in my right shoulder was intensely aggravated but i would much rather endure physical pain than emotional pain in my deepest depressions i have always been grateful for any physical pain able to distract me from myself since i suffer from chronic pain , my back can actually be a blessing in this dreadful state the self absorption of depression is definitely narcissistic , but constitutes a very unhealthy , regressive narcissism the narcissism of abandonment , of being abandoned to oneself , encased , enbalmed , encorpsed in an awkward body with all its fluids and needs one feels as vulnerable as a white grub on asphalt the birds are sure to come , all the birds are looking and the fear of the predator extends to all i am literally more afraid than glad when kathleen gets home , the person who most loves me tears streamed down my face when i told her i was going fishing still , i went it was a good outing because i only lost one lure i 'll close with a link to another great poem on depression i 've already posted coleridge 's dejection an ode , and jane kenyon 's having it out with melancholy today 's link is to gerard manley hopkins' no worst , there is none who am i to put a kilorat value on my condition ? in the belly of the beast , ce
