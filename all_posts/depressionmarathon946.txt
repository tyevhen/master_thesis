my knee hurts i worked today , and i walk all day at work walking actually hurts worse than running , so i was pretty sore when i got home i just looked at my training schedule for this week , and as i suspected , miles is on tap this saturday i 've decided to take an extra day of rest tomorrow , although i was able to run my mile recovery run today without much difficulty like i said , walking causes more discomfort than running this sucks , and i'm really worried it 's just itb tendinitis , but tendinitis can sometimes be a bugger to conquer ! i'm icing , icing , icing , and i 'll continue treating myself with ultrasound at work tomorrow one benefit of being a pt but i am worried things were going so well i resent this distraction ! i 've worked so hard already i really do n't want this to get in my way i have a feeling i 'll be repeating multiple serenity prayers over the next several days god , grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change honestly , i 'd rather pray for things to change !
