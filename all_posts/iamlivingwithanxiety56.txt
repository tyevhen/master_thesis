this week i had to travel for work , and both my outgoing and incoming flights were delayed when i was returning home , the plane had to return to the gate twice before we boarded another plane ! before recovery , i certainly would have worked up these situations , lamenting the injustice and unfairness of them i did have a brief flare of temper , but i recognized and spotted this as average i didn t work it up i acknowledged that disappointments are part of everyday life , and that flight delays are really trivialities i did not let my angry or fearful temper to develop into symptoms i forgot to endorse myself for handling these situations so well , so i m endorsing myself now while other passengers were obviously irritated , i remained cool , calm , and collected i am so thankful for my recovery training !
