photo by navarta last night was horrible in sooo many ways first off , i was doing laundry and i am not used to where some new furniture has been placed so i ran right into a nightstand with my knee because the laundry i was carrying blocked my view i dropped everything and hit the floor it hurt so bad it started bruising immediately and i have a nice muscle bruise about the size of a golf ball on my leg that shoots pain anytime i move i then successfully stubbed my toes on one of my barstools granted i am a bit of a clutz and am always covered in bruises that i have no idea how i got them no , ty doesn t beat me that night was full of nightmares first i dreamed about a woman that got kidnapped and she was tortured and they put it all on television very weird than i dreamt that tyler and i were trying to save her and we got shot , and no one was helping us paramedics came and gave me an oxygen mask and then left again and never returned the mask wasn t helping and i couldn t breathe i could feel myself blacking out as if i was dying and i couldn t figure out why the paramedics weren t coming back it woke me up gasping for breath and crying plus when i woke up my sore throat was the worst it has been so far after a few minutes of recovery , i fell back asleep to dream about my brother in law dying unexpectedly and i spent the rest of the night crying and grieving in my dream and trying to console his wife , my sister in law it was so horrible i woke up with my neck stiff and exhausted and anxious then i realized i had never turned my alarm clock on so i was an hour late so i had to get up and hurry to get ready for work it was the first time i woke up feeling anxious in a few weeks tyler thinks maybe my nightmares are from watching too much court tv it s my favorite channel and i love a good murder mystery just not when i m in it ! i do watch a lot of crime shows i admit and its possible that may play a role somehow today is the day i have been dreading all month i have a bridal luncheon and a wedding reception tonight i m leaving in about minutes so i hope my luck will turn around i ll let you know how it turns out if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety you might also like the power of nightmares safety first ? how dreaming about positivity actually boosts my confidence rejecting rejection linkwithin
