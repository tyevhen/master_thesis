most people enjoy a tipple or two , you may enjoy catching up with colleagues in the pub after work on thursday your friday night curry just would n't be the same without a couple of beers the pub lunch with the girls on saturday is crying out for a glass or two of chardonnay and no sunday roast would be complete without a nice rioja ! it is far too easy to include alcohol into our lives and before we know it we are drinking above the government recommendations i do enjoy a drink or three and not wanting to come across as a raving alcoholic i decided to do a spot of research for my alcohol free resolution the results were shocking so what are the government guidelines ? the government advises that we do not regularly drink more than the daily unit guidelines , for men this would be units a day this is the equivalent of a pint and a half of beer a day for women it 's less , units which is the equivalent of a ml glass of wine if , like me , you have fabricated the number of units you consume when asked by your doctor go on , admit it then you need to log on to the drinkaware website this site is a wonderful resource for all your alcohol related questions they have a simple calculator where you can work out your units per day or week it calculates the total number of units , total number of calories and shows you just how much damage you are doing to your health i was shocked to discover that after a 'jolly' easter sunday spent with my family , i was classified as a 'binge level drinker' okay , i admit we did consume a fair amount over our easter buffet and i was a peculiar shade of green on bank holiday monday but binge level ! maybe this no alcohol resolution would n't be such a bad idea after all my april resolution is therefore under way , days alcohol free , no alcohol , ou est le vin ? this is going to be a tough one i could have chosen february to tackle this resolution as it would have been a shorter month but i'm here now , the challenge has been set and i am ready and raring to go luckily for me i am a bit of a tea face so when i look at my wine free fridge at least i know i can put the kettle on and have a nice cup of teltey instead please stick with me throughout april , i have a week away with my children , my dad 's birthday party and a girl 's night out , all without so much as a sip of alcohol , so moral support would be gratefully received if you have any top tips for alcohol free survival tactics then i would love to hear them , maybe you have a 'mocktail' recipe i could try out i look forward to hearing your ideas , until next week let 's get the kettle on ! tetley teafolk
