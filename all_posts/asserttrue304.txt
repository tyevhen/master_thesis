everybody knows viruses are n't alive or at least , virions extracellular viral particles are n't alive a virus needs a host in which to multiply once inside the host , the virus hijacks host processes to its own ends so typically , a virus 's genome contains genes for capsid proteins , replication enzymes , nucleases for breaking down the host 's nucleic acids , proteases for breaking down proteins , and so on the last thing in the world you 'd expect to find in a viral genome is a bonafide metabolic gene but guess what ? that 's exactly what you find in the dna of certain marine viruses that attack some of the world 's smallest algae cells , namely algae of the ostreococcus and micromonas varieties electronic microscopy of infected ostreococcus tauri cells the bar represents nanometers , in photos a through d in e and f , the bar is nm virus particles are shown with arrows chl chloroplast cyt cytoplasm , n nucleus , m mitochondrion , sg starch grain b c show viruses accumulating in the cytoplasm before cell lysis occurs in d , virus particles clump together around a lysed cell in e , a full virus particle is stuck to the cell f shows an empty particle left on the cell surface after injection of its contents into the cell from derelle et al , life cycle and genome of otv , a large dna virus of the pelagic marine unicellular green alga ostreococcus tauri , plos , ostreococcus is unusual in being a full blown marine eukaryote that 's smaller , physically , than some bacteria at less than a micron in diameter , ostreococcus has room for exactly one mitochondrion , one chloroplast , a nucleus containing around million base pairs of dna , a starch grain , and an overnight bag containing some cytoplasm it 's crowded in there it turns out , ostreococcus is vulnerable to attack by a number of viruses the viruses are surprisingly large with around k base pairs of dna , but the real surprise is what 's in the viral genome a true metabolic gene , pfka , which encodes the enzyme phosphofructokinase pfk pfk is a key enzyme of glycolysis , the anaerobic energy pathway that converts glucose to pyruvate and atp if you ask a biochemist to name an enzyme that 's stereotypically metabolic , chances are pretty good she 'll name pfk it 's the poster child of metabolic enzymes if you go to http www uniprot org uniprot ewm and click the blast tab , then click the blast button , you 'll run a search against millions of protein sequences at uniprot org using the o tauri virus pfk protein sequence as a query what you 'll get back is something like this top hits against o tauri virus phosphofructokinase organism length id score e value gene identifier ostreococcus tauri virus , otv ostreococcus lucimarinus virus olv , olog ostreococcus lucimarinus virus olv , olv ostreococcus lucimarinus virus olv , omvg ostreococcus lucimarinus virus olv , olvg ostreococcus lucimarinus virus olv , olng ostreococcus tauri virus , otv ostreococcus virus osv , osv f ostreococcus tauri virus rt otv micromonas sp rcc virus mpv mpv micromonas pusilla virus sp mpv sp mpxg micromonas pusilla virus pl mpwg actinoplanes friuliensis dsm afr actinoplanes sp n l paraprevotella clara cag bn all of these hits except the last are viral pfk proteins the last organisms in the table representing the best non viral hits are bacteria notice that the id percentage of identical amino acids in the protein sequence quickly drops off as you go from micromonas pusilla virus to bacteria also notice , the viral host organisms are nowhere in sight the viral pfk does not match the host pfk meaning , perhaps , that one does not derive from the other , or that they do derive from each other but have diverged so far apart , over the millennia , that they 're no longer similar there are no other glycolysis enzymes as far as i know in the viral genomes so what on earth is pfk doing there ? interesting you should ask first , it 's been known for some time that fructose , biphosphate the end product of the reaction catalyzed by pfk has the effect of delaying cell death in animal tissues in the cell nucleus , fructose , biphosphate is n't just a metabolic intermediate , but an important signalling molecule when university of louisville scientists overexpressed pfk in hela cells , they observed increased cell proliferation hela cells , like most eukaryotic cells , have several forms of the pfk enzyme , and one is localized to the nucleus when the nuclear enzyme is overexpressed , it leads to increased expression of several key cell cycle proteins , including cyclin dependent kinases proteins that control the mitosis cycle when i read about the university of louisville work , i decided to run a blast search against viral genomes using the cdka cyclin dependent kinase gene of arabidopsis thaliana a commonly studied plant as a query , to see if any viruses come with their own cdk enzymes i got hits all viral , albeit mostly of low quality identities , best e value , for proteins variously identified as uncharacterized protein , putative serine threonine protein kinase , cyclin domain fused to serine threonine kinase , and so on ordinarily i 'd dismiss hits of this low quality level as being spurious but experience has shown that viral enzymes are pretty much always weak signal hits when probed with a non viral query in plain english viral proteins rarely show much homology with their supposed host orthologs in this case , i'm willing to believe that a good many of the arabidopsis cdka hits do , in fact , represent cyclin dependent kinases encoded by viruses it 's the kind of dastardly thing large dna viruses are capable of let 's put it this way if no large dna virus encodes a cyclin dependent kinase , i 'd be very surprised viruses are good at figuring out how to prolong the life of a cell that does n't even know it 's dead yet phosphofructokinase proves it
