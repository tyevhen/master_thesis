i 've been having a bit of a difficult time writing lately it 's not that stuff is n't happening , it always is i am kind of in autism mommy burn out i am feeling discouraged , exhausted , and kind of lost i am not sure what steps to take next jack 's study drug has n't really done much yet he continues to be more emotional oh joy ! , but that 's about it he is still sleeping pretty well it has n't even been a month yet so i am waiting nate has been regressing again not using many words at all right now , except more , and a couple others he is very stimmy , always very stimmy as i continue on this journey with my beautiful boys it becomes more and more obvious why the puzzle piece was chosen as a symbol for autism the problem is so complex , and the answer is not the same for any two children i have watched so many kiddos pass mine by , kids who were born way after nate asking me why he 's not talking kids starting a gluten free diet and waking up it 's hard , it 's just really hard we have been gluten and dairy free for almost years i have been giving nate shots for a year and a half that 's a miracle thing for many not us curcumin ? a year not much yeast treatments many temporary results at best am i supposed to keep nate on nystatin for the rest of his life ? i just feel like i am missing some huge piece of this puzzle and i do n't know what it is he did n't show any toxicity re heavy metals when we tested , chelation is n't going to really help the therapies have been consistent so it 's not that i want to be that mom who sees her little boys start to thrive i want to have an aha moment and know that things are going to improve and i feel like it 's my fault that it 's not happening
