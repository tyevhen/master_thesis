photo by brittney bush yesterday was a really good day i started off by taking all my pills zoloft , a little clonozapam to help with my initial anxiety , vitamin b and then a one a day women s vitamin pill i was able to eat breakfast with only a minor bit of anxiety on the scale and then surprisingly at noon i was hungry i ate lunch until i felt full and then surprisingly again i wanted to eat more later , so i had a few snacks then when i got home i was hungry for dinner and ate right away i was so excited that i had an appetite and i was able to eat it was a good day this morning was not so good i think that subconsciously i wanted it to be as good a day as yesterday i started off by taking my pills and started to eat a banana i could feel the anxiety growing past to , to maybe even see anxiety scale post for more info i tried listening to my positive affirmations and that seemed to only make me think about it more so i stopped i tried breathing but i couldn t get a deep breath from my stomach i was breathing pretty fast and high in my chest i retreated to the bathroom where i tried to think through my situation i thought to myself what am i saying to make me feel this way ? i returned to my desk and got out my journal to help me figure it out and i responded , i have to eat breakfast , i have to improve , i have to have a good day like yesterday i have to stop feeling this way the perfectionist was shining through all mean and demanding and ugly photo by myrtepeert so i questioned the worst case scenario what if i got sick ? what if i couldn t eat breakfast or lunch or had no appetite ? what if i stopped improving ? i responded with , so what ! so i get sick so i skip breakfast so i wait until my body tells me it s hungry instead of forcing food down it so what if the day isn t perfect life will go on , i will go on then i focused on one of my positive counterstatements , there s no need to push myself i read them over and over from my journal but my mind was still racing and it really wasn t doing anything so i got a scrap piece of paper and started writing the affirmation out in cursive there s no need to push myself i can take as small a step forward as i choose still , the cursive was to fast and the word forward was bothering me because it was making me feel bad that i wasn t necessarily moving forward so i took that one out and i made myself print each letter and read it as i went there is no need to push myself until i had written it out ten times on the piece of paper then i could feel my heart slowing down and i started to believe it it also might have something to do with the fact that its pizza day that s when the whole company gets pizza for lunch it always makes me anxious just going up and assembling around the pizza and having to pile my plate i usually bring it back down to my desk to eat it which is what i will do today but i think there is some anticipatory anxiety there as well so i have about an hour before the pizza comes while i am in a calmer state right now i am going to prepare myself for the event what am i telling myself that is making me a little anxious about getting pizza ? what if someone comments that i am not taking enough food ? what if someone wants me to eat with them ? what if i can t eat it because i feel sick ? what if ? photo by cam ahh so it s the worrier now , making me so upset over something that hasn t even happened photo by son of groucho ok so now i will respond to these worries if someone comments that i am not eating enough or taking enough food , so what ! i can tell them that i am not very hungry and not worry about what their reaction might be if they pass judgment on me what s the worst that could happen ? people are going to not like me or think ill of me no matter how perfect i might try to be so i should stop trying to please them and do what i want , because i m the one that has to eat it if someone wants me to eat with them i will if i am calm , but if i feel anxious i will politely say , i have a lot of work to do so i need to get back to my desk , or i can be honest like my therapist said and say something like , you know , its weird but i tend to lose my appetite when i am eating around others , so i can come and sit with you but i might not eat very much and it might sound awkward but what s the worst that could happen ? they could again pass judgment on me but i have to learn that it s their problem if they think ill of me , not mine and that i am being me which is the most important thing ! if i feel sick and i don t want to eat , than don t eat my body will tell me when it is hungry and there is no need to push myself i can take pizza down to my desk and put it in the fridge for later when i am feeling better in going along with this theme i have stopped counting calories and weighing myself until i am more comfortable with eating in general so it wo n't aggravate the perfectionist ! its been tough , i pass the scale a couple times and want to but i tell myself no , no good will come of that now , i am not ready for that step yet the important thing to remember right now is that i am already worthy as a person and i don t have to prove my worth to people i am already ok just the way i am and the counter statement i want to focus on the most today is there is no need to push myself i think i might make it somehow visible in my cube where i can see it as a daily reminder to myself the exciting thing about today is that i successfully managed an anxiety attack before i let it get out of control i was able to use the coping skills i have been learning about in the book anxiety and phobia workbook by bourne which is a sign of hope and progress in itself a different kind of progress from yesterday
