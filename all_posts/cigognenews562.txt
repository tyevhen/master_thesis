i think where conventional therapy and i part company is on the notion of the imprint , although there is ample evidence for it i am reminded about the imprint today in the press where there is an article on stem cells scientists had found a way to avoid using embryonic stem cells by using current skin cells , and through a complicated procedure managed to wind back the clock and make those cells the equivalent of embryonic again except ! it cannot happen in some cases that is , the adult cells , no matter what they do to them , cannot be rewound to their naked , primal selves they still retain the memory of their experienced selves and therefore cannot be used for stem cell therapy they retain their identity , their real selves no matter what in short , they cannot shake off their imprint memory is so strong and unchangeable that even after a drastic procedure it remains the same in general , embryonic usually means within weeks of conception embryonic , primitive cells can be used because they are as not yet dedicated called pluripotential they have not become what they are destined to bones , blood , kidneys , etc so they are uncommitted and have no special identity researchers can then make them into anything they want they are malleable because they lack experience and they have not as yet evolved in a way , it is what happens to infants who are short on experience they can be made into what the parents need and want once cells become what they were destined to be and have an identity that is imprinted , they often cannot be changed their identity george , the skin cell remains unshakeable so in these skin cells , that were rewound back to their primitive selves , some of them could not be used to rebuild a different organ bone , for example they retained the memory of who they were and the danger of all this is that you start using these cells for therapy and suddenly and i exaggerate you grow teeth in the throat more likely you get what is called a teratoma , growing tumors instead of the desired organ the point being that the imprint is rock solid and is engraved even into microscopic cells and they do not shed their identity easily our human imprint , i propose , is found in every fiber and cell of our being and retains a precise memory of its past so of course it rules our lives and of course , it cannot be pinpointed anywhere in the system since it is everywhere the imprint says , this is what happened to me and this is who i am our memory and our identity become one because the imprint is everywhere , when we relive it there are changes throughout the system and that is why we need to relive to produce profound change in medicine and psychiatry there is more to this story for early , gestational stress leaves a mark on the genes it then hard codes that mark which becomes part of us an epigenetic memory the way this happens is through a process of methylation , adding or sub tracting aspects of the methyl group to the cells stress or primal pain is encoded into the most basic aspects of our cells and endures it can mark the hippocampal cells and so affect later memory the way this evolves helps to define the critical window the time in which the needs must be fulfilled or there is pain imprinted and it defines where the patient must go for resolution the assumption by some researchers is that the process of methylation may be altered and that possibly can be done when the patient goes back to the neurophysiologic state when the imprint occurred it can mean changing the imprint and perhaps normalization of the cell in other words , once that mark is made on the cell we are stressed for life until , and only until , that mark event is revisit and relived and it can be relived unconsciously it can be re experienced without a specific awareness of it once we are locked into the memory circuit but wait a minute the process of methylation can be temporarily reversed with medications such as prozac so tranquilizers can helps us momentarily find surcease now we see how we can confuse genetics with epigenetics because it all seems to be involved with heredity after all , if both parents and grandparents have blue eyes it is not a mystery if the children have blue eyes , but when it comes to behavior and feelings it is another matter because they can be changed through experience those genes undergo and those experiences then decide when those genes are expressed or repressed and it is here that some of the mystery of cancer can be uncovered because it may be that the cells would evolve normally except that stress has provoked repression where it should not be and the cells are now crushed or deviated as they surge forward only to be blocked the cells can no longer be themselves they lose their identity they are changed we are changed
