i am here , and so far feeling okay actually , today was a good day the sun came out from behind the clouds and my mood seemed to follow the sun it 's helped that i 've been extremely busy since arriving late last night my friend kate and i went to the expo at hynes convention center , which was easily the largest , most crowded pre race event i 've ever attended after milling about with tens of thousands of others for a couple of hours we made our way to the finish line , snapped some pictures , shopped a bit in filene 's basement , and then headed to harvard square for lunch and coffee you probably do n't know this , but i used to live here with my ex , and i have n't been back in at least ten years the memories were a bit overwhelming at first , but now i'm just enjoying being back after lunch , we came back to our room i 've now taken my nap , organized me gear , and plan to head out for dinner shortly after that , it will be time for lounging and bed the weather tomorrow is supposed to be just about perfect , except for the wind , so it should be a good day thank you all for your continued support it 's been really nice to have a reprieve from the desperation today really nice
