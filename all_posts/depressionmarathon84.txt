i do n't want to talk about it anymore talking is becoming more harmful than good i sent a note to my psychiatrist yesterday , a note which included the deplorable thoughts running through my fucked up brain it scared her and now i feel bad i did n't mean to scare her that was not at all my intent ! but i guess my thoughts are scary i guess living with these deplorable thoughts desensitizes me to how despicable and abnormal they actually are rereading what i wrote today , it makes sense to me that she may have been alarmed , but i did n't mean to alarm her i am not a fan of crying wolf that 's not my style i was just trying to get the thoughts out of my head she 's read and heard many of my violent , deplorable thoughts before i'm embarrassed to say it never crossed my mind these particular thoughts would alarm her so but they did and now i feel so bad so sorry and so worried i will lose this safe haven for my monstrous thoughts monstrous thoughts in my head are infinitely more powerful than monstrous thoughts written and read phone calls and text messages this morning are annoying me am i okay ? no i'm not but i do n't want to talk about it anymore i do n't want to scare you , alarm you , or force you to run the other way i do n't want the police summoned i do n't need an ambulance i need something , yes , but i do n't want any of it right now i want to scream , leave me alone ! but i also know alone is no good either now i'm afraid but i'm less afraid of the thoughts with which my brain is bombarding me than i am of communicating those thoughts aloud to you where does that leave me ? annoyed scared and tired of talking that 's where
