dear a b again , thank you for individually replying to me i continue to incorporate much pilates to my exercise program which i started ages ago yes , it has helped a lot with my back pain i cut out dairy and gluten long ago also i took a supplement , tremadone that is supposed to help but not sure it does also recent improvement with probiotics and citracel which i used before all not sure if helping , but i keep trying anyway this morning my mantra was you are blessed by god , you need not be afraid for i am afraid of every move i make whether it is the right wrong my history involves a lot of the same things but i have not been able to put my faith in chinese medicine or supplements either food is a big thing but because of trying so much on that score i 've become afraid of eating i know you are trying to help me with all your suggestions but in truth it just adds to my confusion of right and wrong to do what i take from all this is there are people trying to help people but we are all like the blind leading the blind r dear r , yes , nobody knows the answer we all try to help each other based on what has worked for us sometimes some small thing will click , and make a difference seems like you are going in the right direction have faith in the way you have taken authority over your life a b curtiss
