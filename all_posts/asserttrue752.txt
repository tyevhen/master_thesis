in recent weeks , i 've been accused of something no one has even accused me of before creating a meme the charge seems weak to me , though , based on my understanding of meme but let 's review on february , i wrote a blog for cms watch called a reality checklist for vendors in which i enumerated things that a cms software vendor but really , any software vendor needs to do these days in order to stay relevant things like posting a free downloadable eval version of your software on your company web site eating your own dogfood the vendor should use its own software to create its website and having one pricesheet for all customers we do n't quote ten different prices to ten different customers simple things , basic sanity check items for the full list , go here not long thereafter , on march , michael marth wrote a blog at dev day com introducing the cms vendor meme giving day software 's answers to all checklist items in my reality checklist not only that , michael created a scoring system , assigned scores to day 's answers , and challenged tagged several other vendors to respond in like manner this set off a flood of responses from vendors including many vendors who were n't tagged by anyone , and the results are still coming in the situation is well captured by jon marks in his excellent series of blog posts here , where incidentally he calls it a celebrity cms deathmatch as a result of all this , i 've been accused of starting a meme , which makes me want to understand meme better so i 've done a little digging and found the internet definitions of meme rather unsatisfying they seem sloppy , semantically speaking maybe that 's just in the nature of memes some definitions equate meme with slang but in that case , why not just stick with slang ? other definitions point in the direction of slang with a pop culture theme or anything on the internet that has a catchy phrase associated with it it gets even sloppier if you go to http knowyourmeme com , you find things like yo dawg , advice dog , and i like turtles but oddly , not wtf ? some people feel that meme gives memetics a bad name what i 've decided is that it 's easier for me to understand meme in terms of its characteristics rather than a declarative definition from what i can tell , a meme has characteristics of theme a meme captures a theme originality in a new way , with new nuancing compositionality new nuance is achieved by combining other terms and themes emergent lexical cohesion tm through suitable juxtaposition of imagery , slang , conceptual archetypes , etc , it becomes apparent to the first time listener that a familiar notion is encapsulated in the meme that is , a person hearing it for the first time can synthesize the intended meaning , even if the meaning is unexpected transmissibility the meme is easily communicated from one person to another contagion a meme usually spreads if it did n't , it would n't enter the common lexicon that 's still not a satisfying definition of meme , to me , but it captures a lot more of it than the definitions i 've seen floating around on the web so i guess maybe i am guilty of creating a meme , if we get it combined with checklist combined with cms vendors produces a meme but it seems weakly reachable somehow things about x seems to qualify as a meme , though tagging someone to get them to participate in a meme off seems not a meme but a pattern but then again , maybe patterns are memes and so , to finish off this post , i invite commenters to answer the following queston how many memes you can find in this blog post ? i see quite a few but i am interested in knowing what others see in terms of memes also , a challenge extra points , and attribution , to anyone who answers this correctly explain the following meme it 's one of my favorites
