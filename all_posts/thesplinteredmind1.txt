comorbid is an icky word say it with me ko mor bid it means people with mental health issues usually have to carry more than one condition on their backs i lug around adhd , major depressive disorder , and adult tourette s it s a lot of fun , and you should see the muscles on my legs atlas would be jealous last saturday , tourette s was the issue that ruled my day i had so much work to be done , including posting an article on this blog , but instead i was in slow motion everything was harder to do than usual as it usually is when my brain feels as if popcorn was leaping to life underneath it tourette s triggers boredom and frustration , which my adhd self has a low tolerance for , and i wasn t accomplishing what i needed to accomplish , so depression was starting to press in by the beginning of the evening , i knew my day was doomed unless i did something about it i had boosted my protein intake to help reduce the ticking , but my depression was still strong distraction was in order in moderation , distraction can be a very effective coping strategy for fighting depression here s what i did i posted a creative photo of utah s recent snowfall creativity helps offset depression it was a small step , but it felt like an enormous wall then i added new commentary on an old facebook memory i considered it a warmup exercise it is also creative , which helps boosts endorphins this was another small step forward , but it came easier than the first step next , i wrote a critique of facebook s recent news filtering initiative by pointing out how ludicrous their friend algorithms are now i was cooking and thoroughly distracted that post earned a negative comment from a reader for it s randomness inspired by the rebuttal , i also posted a wacky star wars fangirl video by a local mayor taking office now that was random and weird wow what a strange video lastly , throwing caution to the wind , i opened a discussion on how facebook would decide which political side of the government shutdown was fake news then i got to work the depression was abated my ticking had faded none of my friends showed up as planned that evening , so i suddenly had time for more productivity we can leave discussions of how pathetic i must be to be happy to work on a saturday night with no romantic prospects for another time the one regret i had for the evening was tearing apart on twitter an article about gender dominance in picture books the journalist of the article from england engaged me which proved to be a very informative conversation but because it takes so much effort to mentally function when ticking , diplomacy often falls by the wayside i usually try to avoid polemic discussions , but didn t that evening i didn t post anything that was irate or hateful , but i wonder if the journalist was as excited to read my glib insights as i was in typing them what i didn t do that evening was clear out my brand new paper pile monstrosity , or write a book , or finish research for my pok mon book i didn t even watch tv or read a book for entertainment social media and freelance work took up my time if i were to do the evening again , assuming i can have precense of mind when ticking , i would set a timer for each event , and limit my social media to one platform facebook would have been enough i , also , read far too much news , so that distraction needed to be reined in as well however , i did successfully fight off depression , which would have robbed me of several days of productivity if i had let it take root that was my focus sometimes our solutions aren t perfect , which is why i m sharing this with you i don t have a solid grip on my mental health issues i can t snap my fingers and make them go away it is a constant battle , and it consumes so much time however , by experimenting and analyzing , we can hone in on the solutions that work best for us don t let yourself get discouraged , and take the small victories where you can comorbidity can be very difficult to deal with you need a positive attitude to keep up the fight d if you need some ideas on coping strategies , you should read my book on fighting suicidal depression
