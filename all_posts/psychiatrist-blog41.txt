so often i write blog posts about topics i read about in the paper i take a few quotes and expand upon them today i want to look at book review by dr damon tweedy , a psychiatrist at duke university and author of black man in a white coat a doctor 's reflection on race and medicine only this is a little different dr tweedy is reviewing a book that we wrote ! and a fine job he did , if i do say so myself so from the washington post , to appear in print tomorrow , tweedy writes about committed the battle over involuntary psychiatric care here , they explore forced psychiatric care , perhaps the most polarizing aspect of a controversial profession the result is a highly informative and surprisingly balanced book that should be read by anyone with a personal or professional stake in how the mental health system provides care to those with chronic severe illnesses and those in acute crisis miller and hanson take us on a journey across america , where we witness significant variability in how states approach the issue of forced care in some states , patients must be deemed imminently dangerous to themselves or others i e high risk for suicide or homicide for forced treatment , while in other states an inability to provide for basic needs due to mental illness is sufficient the process of commitment also differs california , for instance , does not require a formal psychiatric evaluation before patients can be involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital , while in maryland an evaluation must be done before admission and requires the input of two physicians or psychologists until recently , doctors in virginia could not use the input of family members in assessing a person s potential dangerousness and finally although committed explores a complex subject , miller and hanson make a great effort to humanize this discussion in each section , they introduce us to individuals patients , family members , advocates , lawmakers , emergency room doctors , psychiatrists , police officers and judges involved in some aspect of forced treatment thank you , dr tweedy !
