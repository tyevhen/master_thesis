my head is full of noise today not sure what 's going on could be stress , i suppose i had my first day of splitting time between two facilities today , and i saw more patients than there was realistically time to see ! new environment , unfamiliar patients , and too busy it all added up to stress on top of stress today that could be what 's causing the noise , i guess the noise actually started yesterday , or maybe it was the day before that i ca n't remember my brain 's been too noisy to allow for new memory my thoughts are racing i'm having flashbacks to years ago distress , flashbacks of a long ago suicide attempt there 's so much noise i had to turn off my radio on the way home from work the competing external noise was just too much my head is full of noise maybe this does n't make sense to some of you maybe it 's one of those things a person has to experience to fully understand so some of you may think i'm nuts , and some of you may understand i understand this , noise is uncomfortable , disconcerting , distracting , frustrating , and irritating it 's also quite tiring , and i do n't need anything else dragging me down
