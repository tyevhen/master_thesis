the surprises just keep coming when you start doing comparative genomics on the desktop which is so easy with all the great tools at genomevolution org and elsewhere , it 's amazing how quickly you run into things that make you slap yourself on the side of the head and go whaaaa ? ? ? ? if you know anything about dna or even if you do n't , this one will set you back i 've written before about chargaff 's second parity rule , which peculiarly states that a t and g c not just for double stranded dna that 's the first parity rule but for bases in a single strand of dna the first parity rule is basic it 's what allows one strand of dna to be complementary to another the second parity rule is not so intuitive why should the amount of adenine have to equal the amount of thymine or guanine equal cytosine in a single strand of dna ? the conventional argument is that nature does n't play favorites with purines and pyrimidines there 's no reason in theory why a single strand of dna should have an excess of purines over pyrimidines or vice versa , all things being equal but it turns out , strand asymmetry vis a vis purines and pyrimidines is not only not uncommon , it 's the rule some call it szybalski 's rule , in fact you can prove it to yourself very easily if you obtain a codon usage chart for a particular organism , then add the frequencies of occurrence of each base in each codon , you can get the relative abundances of the four bases a , g , t , c for the coding regions on which the codon chart was based let 's take a simple example that requires no calculation clostridium botulinum just by eyeballing the chart below , you can quickly see that for c botulinum codons using purines a and g are way more often used than codons containing pyrimidines t and c note the green highlighted codons if you do the math , you 'll find that in c botulinum , g and a combined outnumber t and c by a factor of that 's a pretty extreme purine pyrimidine ratio remember that we 're dealing with a single strand of dna here codon frequencies are derived from the so called message strand of dna in coding regions i 've done this calculation for , different bacterial species do n't worry , it 's all automated , and the bottom line is , the greater the dna 's a t content or , equivalently , the less its g c content , the greater the purine imbalance see this post for a nice graph if you inspect enough codon charts you 'll quickly realize that chargaff 's second parity rule never holds true except now and then by chance it 's a bogus rule , at least in coding regions dna that actually gets transcribed in vivo it may have applicability to pseudogenes or junk dna but then again , i have n't checked it may well not apply there either if chargaff 's second rule were true , we would expect to find that g c and a t , because that 's what the rule says i went through the codon frequency data for , different bacterial species and then plotted the ratio of g to c which chargaff says should equal for each species against the a t content which is a kind of phylogenetic signature for each species i was shocked by what i found using base abundances derived from codon frequency data , i calculated g c for , bacterial species and plotted it against total a t content each dot represents a genome for a particular organism chargaff 's second parity rule predicts a horizontal line at y clearly , that rule does n't hold i was n't so much shocked by the fact that chargaff 's rule does n't hold i already knew that what 's shocking is that the ratio of g to c goes up as a t increases , which means g c is going up even as g c is going down by definition , g c goes down as a t goes up chargaff says g c should always equal in reality , it never does except by chance what we find is , the less g or c the dna has , the greater the ratio of g to c to put it differently at the high at end of the phylogenetic scale , cytosine is decreasing faster much faster than guanine , as overall g c content goes down when i first plotted this graph , i used a linear regression to get a line that minimizes the sum of squared absolute error that line turned out to be given by a t then i saw that the data looked exponential , not linear so i refitted the data with a power curve the red curve shown above given by g c a t a t which fit the data even better minimum summed error instead of what struck me as strange is that the golden ratio shows up in the power curve formula above , but also , the linear form of the regression has g c equaliing when a t goes to which is almost the golden ratio in a previous post , i mentioned finding that the ratio a t tends to approximate the golden ratio as a t approaches if this were to hold true , it could mean that a t and g c both approach the golden ratio as a t approaches , which would be weird indeed for now , i'm not going to make the claim that the golden ratio figures into any of this , because it reeks too much of numerology and intelligent design and i'm a fan of neither i do think it 's mildly interesting that a t and g c both approach a similar number as a t approaches unity comments , as usual , are welcome
