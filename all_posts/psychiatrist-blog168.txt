open a newspaper or read a medical journal or look at your twitter feed and you 'll learn a sad fact something you 're doing and probably something rather fun puts you at increased risk of some bad disease it sounds very ominous and you should stop doing those fun things sometimes , i have to scratch my head and say 'really ? what does that actually mean ? and while i 've decided that my diet coke habit probably is n't particularly healthy and have mostly , sort of , cut way back , it caught my attention when i saw that one diet soda a day increases the risk of stroke by actually , it caught my attention because it was in my social media feeds about a zillion times tweeted by the cleveland clinic then retweeted by countless others really ? how can anyone know that ? so the first thing i wondered was how common is stroke ? i mean , a increase is not huge , it 's not like it makes you times a increase likely to have a stroke , and i did n't know how common stroke is a small increase for an unlikely event stroke , for any given person for any given year caused by a common habit diet soda ingestion or actually any soda ingestion as i would soon learn would seem like a difficult thing to quantify and measure and then you might wonder if diet drinks day increase the risk by and if diet drinks day double it , and what about adding artificial sweeteners to coffee or tea ? so i went to look for the prevalence of stroke and what i discovered was for adults over age have had a stroke but what surprised me was how the data was collected , per the cdc website brfss is a state based , random digit dialed telephone survey of the noninstitutionalized , u s civilian population aged years and is administered by state health departments in collaboration with cdc in , the median response rate among states , based on council of american survey and research organizations guidelines , was range this rate accounts for the efficiency of the telephone sampling method used and participation rates among eligible respondents who were contacted a total of , respondents from all states , dc , puerto rico , and usvi participated in the survey state including dc and territory sample sizes ranged from , usvi to , washington the racial ethnic national sample sizes ranged from , ai ans to , whites all prevalence estimates in this report have a numerator and a relative standard error are ensure estimates stable sup that to survey respondents answered the question , has a doctor or other health professional ever told you that you had a stroke ? differences in prevalence were assessed by age group , sex , race ethnicity , education level , and state or territory of residence data were weighted to reflect the population aged years in each state and territory and were age adjusted to the u s standard population to allow for more meaningful comparisons between states and between demographic groups the weighted state prevalence values were used to estimate the number of persons with a history of stroke in various demographic groups and in each state or territory respondents provided racial ethnic identification those who identified themselves as multiracial were included in a separate category ok , so first off , half the people do n't answer are those who refuse to participate more or less likely to have had strokes ? the survey requires that someone answer the phone , so all the people who were too disabled to answer the phone are excluded from the survey results people with lower educational levels were more likely to have had strokes could it be that people with lower educational levels were less likely to understand the question , or to confuse a doctor 's warning you could have a stroke with you have had a stroke ? and could it be that people who have had strokes do n't understand the question or have anosognosia so they do n't know they 've had a stroke ? i'm so confused in the study below , the incidence of stroke was also self reported but the report of a stroke was then verified by review of medical records i suppose they still might not capture those who have fatal strokes or those who do n't know they 've had a stroke and back to the cleveland clinic study actually it 's diet soda and sugar containing soda that increases risk switching to skim milk apparently decreases risk by go figure in this study , the participants were asked for a self report with forced choice responses none , up to one week , one per week up to one day , more than one per day , etc coffee consumption , by the way , lowered risk , but i could n't figure out if drinking coffee and skim milk would counteract the risk of drinking soda before i wash away
