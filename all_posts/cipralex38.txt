hello my friends , i 've been asked lately what really piss me off , because some people that know many more and some less said i keep a constant poker face all the time , and they do n't see me angry or too upset or too happy i wonder why ? maybe its just the way i always been or maybe its cipralex , honestly ? i could n't care less inside i'm happy and everything is under control , i have no panic attacks , no anxiety and no depression from months now so i'm feeling good i have n't told my girlfriend about cipralex yet , i'm meeting my doctor in couple of days and i 'll ask him again when can i stop taking the pills , not that i mind i have no side effects at all , its just that i hate the fact that i'm hiding this from everyone around me so many things have changed and i like being numb because my numb state is everyone 's else normal state i 've read some comments asking about caffeine and cipralex , i can tell you that i drink a lot of coffeei love coffee and i had no problems with it , but than again , in the first months you should lower your coffee consumption ok , just wanted to update you guys about how i'm doing take care and we 'll talk soon oh , and happy holidays ! email this blogthis ! share to twitter share to facebook reactions
