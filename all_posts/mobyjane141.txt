i'm not great at blogging yet this second paragraph showed up in my drafts folder so i do n't know if i already published it or not it 's worth saying again , anyway i wrote a middle school book about bullies called hanner and the bullies which again takes up this simple idea when we do n't take up our rightful space we create a kind of social and psychological vacuum in the world which is immediately filled up by something that should n't be there bullies for one some of us feel entitled to take our space in life and some of us must somehow earn that entitlement for ourselves my husband , for instance , has always pushed right ahead just as if everybody liked him i suspect he cares somewhat whether or not people like him , but it is not necessary for him to push ahead i think he expects people to like him , for he is pretty satisfied with himself whereas i , like you , felt unsure to push ahead as if i was feeling already accepted for most of my life i needed to prove myself somehow some of us have mild social anxiety until we risk ourselves often enough and see that it does n't kill us it is possible to get to the point of hey we 're all just people here , are n't we , and i'm a people , too , so there ! !
