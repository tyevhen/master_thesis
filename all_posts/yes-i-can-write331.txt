is n't it strange how small sounds , sights , smells can trigger a memory , just like that ? a flash of something in the past , so strong it almost feels like , for a moment , you 're actually there again i was just sitting by my computer , window open wide , warm air blowing and sunlight streaming in , when i heard a crow caw , and a memory flashed in that memory , i'm looking out of the window of my great grandmother , nan 's , house in gaspe crows wheel in the air , cawing they also cluster on the ground , talking and squabbling while they hurry to grab the best bits of food nan would always keep a large , once white , bucket in the kitchen for table scraps the evidence of thousands of meals was forever immortalized on that bucket in a variety of colors , mostly those of rotting food ! then , periodically , she 'd toss the scraps out onto the wide expanse of mowed grass that stretched out from the side door and i 'd watch the crows i 've always loved crows ! it 's been many years since i'm been to gaspe now , but i still remember it as one of the most beautiful places on earth it 's right near where the great st laurent river meets the atlantic ocean , and as it 's too far north for it to be fashionable as anything but a tourist destination , it 's not overly populated vast tracts of forest lie virtually untouched , except for where the ski slopes cut abruptly through the mountainsides , scarring a place that i wish i could have seen several hundred years ago you can pick cranberries in the meadows , or buckets full of wild blueberries , sweet and sun warmed , right off the plants , clustered in the edges of the forest where grass turns to trees you see both deer and moose tracks regularly , and the area is also home to a host of other wildlife by the seashore , you can play in the waves , as long as you 're careful of the occasionally deadly undertows , and i 've watched seals playing in the water a mere few dozen feet from the shore as you walk along certain beaches , on one side is the water , and on the other side , cliffs , crumbling slowly and surely down onto the beach , old summer houses sitting precariously close to the ever retreating edge i 've sat in an unoccupied life guards chair , and looked out onto a glittery , ever moving expanse of water that stretches on forever i 've walked the beach at night , when the cool white gray blue light of the moon stretches out from the shore to a perfectly full disk , a pathway to the moon some places you go , you can watch the whales lifting themselves out of the water for a perfect photographic moment , or , more likely , simply see the flash of fin , and feel a thrill of excitement at getting even a glimpse of one of the most amazing creatures on earth in the harsh rocks near the waters edge , you can go searching for fossils , imprints of old sea life on broken rocks , creatures that have been dead for millions of years , and trace their spiral shells with your fingertips , cool and hard to the touch i love that place so much , even though i have n't been there since i was , and i have n't been there for more than two days since i was ! nan , my great grandmother , is still alive , and turning i can hardly believe it ! next month however , she 's not really up to taking care of herself anymore , and lives with her son , although he brings her back to gaspe every single summer the house where they stay , the house i remember so well , is right next to the very same house that my nan grew up in , almost a century ago , a house that was built by her father in the late 's in the old cemetery , now hidden behind someones house and almost inaccessible , you can find the names of my family carved in stone , or so i 've been told so much of my ancestral history lives on there , and so , so many memories from my childhood so much beauty and life , far away from the city lights , and far enough north that you can watch the northern lights flicker , ethereal and unearthly , across the night sky i have to go back there soon because i miss it peace , idzie you might also like a trip to gaspe going to gasp thoughts , memories , emotions building life on a foundation of untamed learning linkwithin
