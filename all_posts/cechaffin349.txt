god , what a nuisance ! i 've been trying to sort my publications , some indexed by the names of journals , some by the titles of individual pieces , and some by other titles for the same pieces using google and other sources , i have managed to discover , so far , the following journals either without a website or without archives apples and oranges a writer s choice adirondack review artemis avalon beauty for ashes blue moon review brownflower burn conspire disclosures dust on my palms ez books free cuisenart gravity horsethief s journal lid mefisto muse apprentice guild olympus poetry cafe poetry magazine online journal , not the big one poetry now poetry tonight recursive angel samsara savoy serpentine shallow end slumgullion spoken word susquehanna review tintern abbey wired heart world poetry writer s hood ze books zuzu s petals if i am in error about any of these , i would appreciate a note from readers or their scattered connections on the literary internet there are also those journals who list me in their archives as a contributor , but strangely , have no record of or links to my poems often right next to another poet whose links are still good i assume this is random and not personal , though i have made some enemies in my faux career anyway , my back hurts terribly from sitting despite the new pain medication , even though i did go easy at the gym yesterday since my recent cold i 've put at least ten pounds back on from not exercising regularly , then kathleen and i also became derelict re our low carb high protein diet three steps forward and four steps back is it discouraging to find so much of your work erased from the net forever ? here 's an advantage when there is no record of a work i consider it unpublished and open for submission again , a liberty i do n't take with print which may appear inconsistent until you realize that with print publications i can still hold the evidence in my greedy little narcissistic hand where all evidence is erased , can anything have happened ? speaking of narcissism , kathleen and i watched the original sunset boulevard last night , and kathleen threatened to fall asleep before the end , whereupon i threatened her with this you can never call me narcissistic again if you do n't finish this movie i mean , c'mon compared to norma desmond even poets are normal such a comparison does stretch the marvin bell curve ah , so little to say , so much to write we 'll be house sitting for my sister this weekend in the lovely sf suburb of burlingame , while she goes south to check out the alma mater of my middle daughter and myself , ucla my sister 's only daughter is making the college tour now , and from what i understand , likely has her choice of most , and money is no object thanks to the prudent planning of her parents i had to put myself through college and medical school , which includes loans , of course and i could n't help my one college graduate daughter much monetarily , though some mostly i provided emotional support and medical expertise i'm still very proud that she , a bipolar i , got through ucla in four years a miracle she has guts and determination , which can sometimes appear as an extreme and brittle stubbornness enough about family like photos from a wallet , all that patter is a bore , is n't it ? here 's a photo of my grandson i'm in a mixed state fragile and sort of and at the same time cried on the treadmill yesterday , have been anxious but while i'm working i naturally feel better as i am not thinking about myself even if i'm writing about myself , which writers understand what 's a kilorat and a kilobunny at the same time ? put me at two kilobats thine , ce
