we bought a new camera ! i 've been wanting a digital slr camera for ages , but i 've been hemming and hawing about the price , and whether i'm a 'good enough photographer' and whether the price will go down significantly so i should wait but costco had a really good deal on the camera i wanted , and my dad offered to pay a huge chunk if he gets to borrow it sometimes , and i do really want it so last night my mother , father , and i piled into the car , excitedly poked at the floor model or at least i did that , and waited anxiously while they dug around in the storeroom to find it erm , wait a second , that was just me as well so , even though i'm not using it until christmas , and we only opened the box up long enough to make sure everything was there , i now own a brand new canon eos digital rebel xs with a mm lens and a mm lens , and a nice camera bag to keep it all in so i am very happy about that ! even though , having just spent , i'm also very worried that prices will drop significantly after christmas oh , and yes that 's the exact type of camera i got featured below , only mine is in silver peace , idzie you might also like amazingly this year in life including dogs , trips , zines and a day well spent christmas celebrations linkwithin
