i had a wonderful time at my cake night saturday night my friend cindy really spoke from her heart and introduced me with very kind words i was quite humbled when i took the podium , i had three pages of notes from which to choose appropriate comments i told you i was fretting about this ! in the end , i have no idea what i said i know i thanked all of my guests for their roles in my recovery , but i'm not sure it was eloquent nor even coherent ! i did have a great night i was so humbled and honored by the presence of so many of those on my treatment team it really was special i hope it was nice for them to see me outside of an office , as the person i am today is a direct result of their efforts overall , it was a fun , funny , festive evening with lots of smiles , laughter , and hugs i ran my last long run before austin on saturday as well i did n't feel very well throughout the run , but i finished the miles anyway my friend , renee , joined me for miles that was nice i have a couple of fast workouts this week and then it 's all downhill until race day i think i'm ready i hope it 's warm and sunny in texas by then ! i interviewed and hired a dog sitter for puck tonight i'm such a nervous mom when it comes to leaving my boy the young guy i hired is an experienced dog sitter , and puck seemed very comfortable with him i feel better about leaving puck and my house knowing someone will be here taking care of both but i still do n't like leaving puck like i said , i'm a bit of a nervous nelly when it comes to my boy and now it 's time for me to give my boy some attention , so i must go until we meet again , consider this quote it certainly speaks to me gratitude unlocks the fullness of life it turns what we have into enough , and more it turns denial into acceptance , chaos to order , confusion to clarity it can turn a meal into a feast , a house into a home , a stranger into a friend gratitude makes sense of our past , brings peace for today , and creates a vision for tomorrow melody beattie
