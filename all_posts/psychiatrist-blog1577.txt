good morning it 's sunday have you set your clocks back ? i'm on my second cup of coffee with the new york times , max is up and barking at the neighbors , clink has already emailed me about her chocolate consumption , roy is working diligently on the podcast so on today 's front page there is an article about the popularity of illegal cell phone jammers press a button and everyone in certain radius loses their calls gary , a therapist in ohio who also declined to give his last name , citing the illegality of the devices , says jamming is necessary to do his job effectively he runs group therapy sessions for sufferers of eating disorders in one session , a woman s confession was rudely interrupted she was talking about sexual abuse , gary said someone s cellphone went off and they carried on a conversation there s no etiquette , he said it s a pandemic gary said phone calls interrupted therapy all the time , despite a no phones policy four months ago , he paid for a jammer , which he placed surreptitiously on one side of the room he tells patients that if they are expecting an emergency call , they should give out the front desk s number he has not told them about the jammer i 'll be thankful i have n't had to resort to this i do n't run groups , and most people seem to get that they 're paying for my time people mostly parents do take calls during session , but they tend to keep them very brief i ca n't talk right now , i 'll call you back in a few minutes and i have to admit that sometimes i forget to turn my own phone off it rings and i silence it immediately i 've never actually answered a call during someone 's session once in a great while , someone has an extended cell phone conversation during their psychotherapy session always a little weird for me to be trapped listening to the one sided nature of a private communication , but hey i 'll be glad it 's a rare event and extend my sympathy to gary and his eating disorder group perhaps they should just do a group turnoff at the beginning of the sessions ?
