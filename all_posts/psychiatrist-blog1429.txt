i received the following e mail from a friend copied without permission i get some of the craziest emails but this one is short and pretty good i mean , we 're all a bit nutty but really psychopath test read this question , come up with an answer and then scroll down to the bottom for the result this is not a trick question it is as it reads no one i know has got it right a woman , while at the funeral of her own mother , met a guy whom she did not know she thought this guy was amazing she believed him to be her dream guy so much , that she fell in love with him right there , but never asked for his number and could not find him a few days later she killed her sister question what is her motive for killing her sister ? give this some thought before you answer answer she was hoping the guy would appear at the funeral again if you answered this correctly , you think like a psychopath this was a test by a famous american psychologist used to test if one has the same mentality as a killer many arrested serial killers took part in the test and answered the question correctly if you did n't answer the question correctly , good for you if you got the answer correct , please let me know so i can take you off my email list ha so i got it right i promise i have n't killed anyone , but apparently i'm off harry 's e mail list the picture , by the way , was stolen off fat doctor 's blog psychopathic cows for sure clink , any thoughts here ?
