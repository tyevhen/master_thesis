dear friends , for my th post imagine ! i will attempt to explain my meditation technique , one arrived at by long experience here it is blankness merging soundlessly with your immediate environment recognition opening your eyes to your environment and seeing it anew acceptance the accepting of all things , inhaling the known universe thanksgiving thanks should erupt for a world greater than our imaginings intercession thanksgiving gives rise to concerns for others , and sometimes concerns for ourselves here i concentrate in prayer towards action action being the fulfillment of prayer praise we praise thee for thy great glory an overflow of praise for the creator the acronym is bra tip or nipple for short we milk the cow of the world and as we do we whisper in her ear , 'you are not true ' richard wilbur it is extremely important in the first three phases to try to avoid any verbal formulations at all , to simply merge , recognize and accept this puts one in the proper frame of mind for the rest you can practice this anytime if you 're tired , embrace blankness and shut your eyes for a few after adequate rest if you do n't fall asleep , which is ok your mind opens to the world again and then appropriates it in acceptance that one does n't expect the world to be any other way than the way it is the first three steps , again , are crucial to the process unless we first get out of our heads we cannot concentrate properly on thanksgiving , intercession and praise if any of you try out this method , please get back to me i do n't know if it only works for me or has wider applications in any case it might help make you more aware and at peace thine at kilobunnies , craig erick
