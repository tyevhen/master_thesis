over the last five years , i have seen an increase in the number of students sending scandalous images of themselves and or others via social media one of the most disturbing incidences that came to our office was of a student and her boyfriend who was living together in a basement apartment while the girl was in the shower , the neighbor upstairs videotaped her and posted her images on the internet shortly after that situation , one of my students sent a video of herself topless to a guy friend months later , the video was posted to a website where she was publically exposed to her classmates and family members in another incident , a video was taken and sent of two students performing a sexual act after the video was sent , a huge blowup occurred in the classroom then there was a huge incident where nude photos of female students from several schools in our area were posted on instagram with derogatory comments the posts were so disgusting that several police agencies were called in to dismantle the posts i could continue to list situation after situation , but you get the picture in all these situations , the students and families became victims of self and peer extortion and our school and law enforcement had to find quick answers peer self extortion aka sexting the act of sexting has become part of the american teen culture within the last three years beyond borders defines sexting as youth creating , sending or sharing sexual images and or videos with peers via the internet and or electronic devices teens are willing to send nude pictures of themselves as a precursor to having sex in fact , law enforcement officer , eric buehler , refers to sexting as the new first base ! although the mean age of sexting is years old , it is middle school age students who are very willing to share with others on social media why would a student expose him herself there are several reasons for sending out risqu images and messages wanting to experiment sexually seeking attention and acceptance from peers feeling pressured or coerced by peers even if a student does not actively engage in sending explicit pictures or texts , he she may be exploited without his her knowledge for instance , photos or videos can be recorded at a sleepover or party , a webcam may be hacked and images sent out to their contacts someone steals the device of a student and sends them out to their contacts , or a person pretends to be someone he or she is not to entice another person to send photos to him or her catfishing the act of sending images of a person without their knowledge is called sextortion and is a type of sexual bullying there are many examples of sextortion cases that have gained national attention since christopher patrick gunn christopher gunn , , either posed as justin beiber or a new boy at school to entice girls to send explicit pictures to him in his ruse as a new student , he would often threaten to send the intimate conversations to the girls' principal if they refused to send photos jonathan vance jonathan vance , , was able to hack into the facebook , email , and myspace accounts of over females in three states by pretending to be a friend or relative he would persuade the girls to give him access to their passwords and log into their accounts anthony stancl anthony stancl , , posed as young girl on facebook and persuaded male classmates in sending him nude photos consequences of sextortion because victims of sextortion are often embarrassed about their involvement , they often fail to report any information about the perp teens who experience this type of exposure tend to socially withdraw , become anxious , use drugs and alcohol , suffer from depression , and some even commit suicide one of the saddest cases i have come across regarding sextortion was the story of canadian teen , amanda todd amanda todd experienced sexual bullying after she met a stranger online who convinced her to flash him a year later , a man on facebook threatened to send her topless photo to others if she did not put on a show even though she complied with his demands , the nude photo was sent to her peers at her school amanda began to become anxious , used drugs to numb her sadness , and even moved schools after several incidents of bullying at her new school , amanda died of suicide how can school counselors make an impact ?
