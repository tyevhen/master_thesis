many people who come to talk therapy with problems find relief and healing by talking to a licensed psychotherapist in either psychodynamic psychotherapy , cognitive behavioral treatment cbt and other forms of regular talk therapy they gain insight into their problems and learn to change their thinking and behavior so that they lead happier lives emdr when talk therapy is n't enough however , for many clients in psychotherapy , regular talk therapy only goes so far and it does n't alleviate their problems these clients might gain an intellectual understanding of their problems and maybe , if they 're in psychodynamic psychotherapy , they even learn to understand the underlying issues that caused the problems in the first place under the best of circumstances , they might even be able to make some changes , but the underlying problems remain and continue to get triggered in new situations in other words , these clients are not really healed often this is not a reflection on the psychotherapist 's skills or the client 's willingness to change it often has more to do with the limitations of talk therapy with certain problems , especially if there is trauma involved what is trauma ? when we talk about trauma , it 's important to know that not all trauma is the same like most emotional problems , it 's a matter of degree the various types of trauma are on a large spectrum from smaller trauma to bigger trauma trauma does n't have to be posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd , like when a soldier is traumatized at war or when a client has been raped or sexually abused , to be considered traumatic trauma also includes less severe problems like getting into a car accident where you are not hurt physically but afterwards you 're too afraid to drive again or , maybe you were in an airplane where there was a lot of turbulence and , even though you were not physically injured , you now have a fear of flying another example of a form of trauma that does n't involve ptsd but which can adversely affect you is if you 're too afraid to get involved in romantic relationships because you were so humiliated as a child that you have low self esteem what all of these examples of trauma have in common is that they have had a negative impact and have caused impairment to everyday functioning when regular talk therapy is not enough , emdr eye movement , desensitization and reprocessing as well as clinical hypnosis also known as hypnotherapy are often much more effective in healing both small and big trauma in this post i 'll focus on emdr what is emdr ? in one of my earlier posts , i defined emdr see the may , post to understand emdr , it 's important to know that our experiences are stored in memory networks in our brains these memory networks are made up of thoughts , images , emotions and body sensations related to each particular experience as we form new memories , they are organized in related memory networks around the earliest memories so , for instance , if a child is bitten by a dog , a memory is formed in his memory network around this experience that would include the bodily sensations of being bitten , the emotional fear , the sound of the dog barking , the image of the dog lunging at him , the image of blood on his leg , the image of his mother yelling at the dog to get away as she came running towards him , and even the scents that were around him as he gets older , he might not have a conscious awareness of this memory , especially if he was too young to talk when he was bitten by the dog , but that first memory is still stored in his memory network when he 's older , if he hears a dog barking , it would probably trigger the emotions and sensations associated with that earlier memory , and he would be afraid or if he sees a dog , even a friendly one , that earlier memory will be triggered with all of the associated fears he might not have a conscious memory of that first experience , but as an adult , when he gets triggered by new situations , he would feel an inexplicable fear why am i so afraid of this dog ? he 's not doing anything to me so , even though there might not be an explicit memory of that ealier experience that he can recall , what 's actually happening is that the earlier experience gets triggered in his brain and he experiences all of the same fears that he experienced when he was bitten in the example above , since the earliest experience has not been processed , it forms a blockage in the memory network so that the traumatic experience remains in the network waiting to be triggered under certain circumstances how does emdr help ?
