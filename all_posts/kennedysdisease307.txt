my neck has been giving me fits this last week i have been one of the fortunate ones that has not experienced any neck problems until now it was so bad three nights this week that i was having neck spasms while brushing my teethe i do not remember ever having a neck spasm in years perhaps it is because i have been working a lot more hours on the computer kda stuff and some fiction writing i probably need to take more breaks if i am going to work hours at the keyboard i know my brother , who is older than me , has had neck weakness for several years at times , he has to hold up his head by resting it on his hand for that reason alone i started performing neck exercises three or more times a week it could also be caused by two new neck exercises that i starting performing last week or a combination of both computer work and the exercises of course it doesn t help that i have turned into a pencil neck these last few years i need to back off on my story writing and mind mapping for a couple of days and see if things improve if that doesn t work , then perhaps try a week without the new exercises has anyone found any neck exercises that has helped you ? i would appreciate your input so i can try them out thanks
