burning midnight , by will mcintosh disclaimer i received this book from the publisher via netgalley in exchange for a fair and honest review this book takes place in the not so distant future a future in which magical spheres have inexplicably appeared all over the world these spheres can be burned by one person , and that person receives an extraordinary gift in order to make enough money to help his mother pay the rent , sully sells spheres at a flea market when an edgy girl with an attitude and great spheres walks in , they make a deal to start hunting together this is by far the best ya science fiction fantasy novel i 've read in years i knew it would be as soon as i started reading the story pretty much starts out as a near future mystery who is this girl hunter and what 's her story ? where 'd the spheres come from , and why ? the action starts out slow and then steadily rises throughout the book until an adrenaline pumped end and the end is where this book went up from stars to stars mcintosh has achieved the unthinkable he 's wrapped up all of his loose threads in one book it 's so nice to read a reasonably non violent , non sexual standalone book once in a while and this one was exceptional , with its mixture of mystery , adventure , and action i 'd recommend this book to people anywhere from about th grade on up , and it 's appropriate for all ages
