i'm writing this post because the new york times has been writing about how thyroid disorders and vitamin b deficiency can be responsible for neuropsychiatric symptoms read the article about vitamin b here read the article about thyroid function here this is news ? when i was in medical school , the knee jerk response to memory complaints was to order labs to rule out the reversible causes of dementia cbc , chemistry panel , vdrl syphilis , thyroid function tests , folate and b levels , urinalysis , and then perhaps a brain ct so let me tell you how a physician thinks about dementia first let me tell you what dementia is the decline in cognitive function from a prior baseline , often seen by the patient as memory problems , beyond what would be expected with normal aging a patient presents with complaints of memory problems the physician usually an internist or primary care doc takes a history when did this start , did anything precede it , are things stable or getting worse ? what exactly is happening and is the patient actually having memory problems ? sometimes people think they are having memory problems , but really what is happening is that they are anxious or distracted , so the information never makes it into their brain to be retrieved or remembered later i told my husband to take out the trash during the super bowl and he did n't remember to do it a quick measurement of memory may be done , such as the mini mental status exam , which tests a variety of components of cognition such as orientation , the ability to immediately recall , memory , concentration , the ability to follow directions , and the ability to copy a diagram , write a sentence , and follow a written command it 's a simple test , and most people get perfect scores , and it 's a quick way to follow progress over time a physical exam is done , including a neuro exam , and if there are focal findings like the absence of reflexes or weakness , or loss of sensation , or a history of loss of consciousness , seizures , or a head injury these are noted the only way to be certain of the type of dementia is to biopsy the brain we do n't generally do that instead , we rule out the reversible causes of cognitive decline infections , thyroid disorders , neurosyphilis , folate orvitamin b deficiency , or metabolic problems such as confusion with markedly elevated blood glucose or neuropsychiatric symptoms with hyperparathyroidism some of these illnesses are discovered with blood tests , others require a scan to look for anatomical lesions , like hydrocephalus , stroke , subdural hematoma if a reversible cause of dementia is found , it can be treated and it will often get better oh , and i should add that major depression can mimic mild dementia , and this too can be treated , it 's called pseudo dementia and when the depression gets better , the dementia gets better if a patient has dementia , and the reversible causes are ruled out , then the diagnosis of depression is based on the features of the disorder and the course it takes alzheimers' disease is the most common type of dementia , and it has a progressive course with some predictability patients with alzheimer 's disease will have a good recall for past events , but they may forget more recent events personality and social appropriateness are preserved until well into the illness , and the early stages are often rather subtle decline can take place over a few years or many years , but the course is always progressive medicines , such as namenda or aricept may be prescribed in the hopes of slowing the course , and patients with vascular dementia may be told to take aspirin to prevent future episodes while patients have good days and bad days , these illnesses do not remit vascular dementias progress in a more step wise course patients will have a sudden onset of impairment , but things stay at that level for a while , until another event happens and there is another sudden decline the course is less predictable with regard to what faculties are compromised when some patients have both forms of dementia , or a mixed etiology other forms of dementia include pick 's disease fronto temporal dementia , lewy body dementia , and dementias associated with huntington 's disease , parkinson 's disease , and hiv , and dementia due to repeated brain trauma okay , this is my quicky discussion of dementia please do n't use this as a comprehensive resource , it 's mostly off the top of my head roy can pipe in with all the things i missed , i'm sure there are plenty
