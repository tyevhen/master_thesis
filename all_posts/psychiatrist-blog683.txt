just thought i 'd put up a quick post to plug a program that looks useful for my patients the prison book program sends books to prisoners who request them from many states i appreciate this because one of the frequent questions i get in my clinic after can i have some of that coffee ? is got anything to read ? boredom is the common denominator of most prisoners , and having something positive or useful to read is a good thing check out the youtube video about the program too
