my friend susan , who has been attending a cardiac support group after her heart valve surgery a few years ago , called recently to catch up she began to tell me about her support group and then stopped , suddenly exasperated there is a woman in the group who is years old and still complaining about how her parents limited her life and caused her so much pain , she said can you imagine ? have you ever heard anything like that ? yes , actually , as a psychotherapist , i 've heard stories like this many times while we are all affected by a variety of life circumstances and events , there are some who find themselves haunted by past pain , by present toxic relationships and by negative thought patterns that prevent them from living life fully and joyfully it occurred to me that , even as we complete annual spring cleaning rituals , read best selling books about the virtues of de cluttering and think more seriously , as our birthdays fly by , about parting with cherished belongings , heirlooms and just plain junk , that we might also think about some emotional de cluttering what is emotional clutter ? it 's the stuff you hold onto that makes living in the present less enjoyable emotional clutter can be grudges and old hurts that weigh you down with remembered pain that stretches to the present and that separates you from those once loved think about it as time goes by , does it really matter who offended whom ? does the apology you felt was due feel so urgent now ? would it feel worse to be the first to say i'm sorry ! or to continue an emotional estrangement ? when you think of the energy it takes to hold onto righteous anger and , over time , the toll this takes on you , do you really want to continue to carry a grudge or nurse old wounds ? or would it feel better to open your mind and your heart , to reach out with love whether or not the other person responds in kind and begin to release those old ghosts from the past ? emotional clutter can be echoes from a distant , painful childhood where the remembered voices of those who caused you to suffer still resonate there are those , like the woman in my friend susan 's therapy group , who cling to pain from the past and preclude any possibilities of growth and change and joyous living there are those whose lives become about victimhood , those whose lives become a string of excuses for not reaching their true potential because of what happened in the past clearing the hurt may mean looking at the situation a new way your parents were n't experts on the person you were or the person you 've grown to be so their hurtful predictions or observations are n't valid anymore it can help lighten a lifelong load of pain to tell yourself that your parents did the best they could , that they loved you as much as they were able and that any hurt that they inflicted , whether intentional or not , came from their own dark place of remembered pain emotional clutter can be toxic relationships and the feelings of resentment and inadequacy these inspire this may be a friendship that has always been problematic or one that has changed over time while healing estrangements can be life affirming , there are times when distance from someone who causes us pain makes perfect sense when i was in my twenties , i had a friend i admired and enjoyed , someone who was quite different from me but , for a time , we celebrated our differences then i began to notice that who i was and what i needed were beyond her consideration and , that as much as i wanted to talk this over , she would never listen she would call me at a m to cry over a broken relationship or simply to read me a poem she had just written , unmindful of my need to sleep because i had to get up and go to work in a few hours as the financial gulf widened between us when her more highly compensated career took off , she made fun of my modest circumstances and asked if i 'd like to live in her maid 's room and jettison my career in journalism to become her secretary maid she was astounded when i turned her offer down and called me ungrateful we drifted apart , both of us finding life perfectly fine without the other in all the years since , i have found freedom , not only in our distance , but also in getting to the point emotionally where i could wish her well and quietly cheer her continuing success without lingering anger or resentments emotional clutter can be agitation over people and events over which you have little , if any , control is it really worth your emotional energy to get upset over something that is unlikely to affect your life like who wins or does n't win the superbowl or dancing with the stars or , more recently , the transition of bruce into caitlin ? the fact that , people actually signed an online petition the other day to urge the ioc to rescind bruce caitlin jenner 's olympic medal is astounding most of these people may disapprove of this sports icon embarking on a gender change in the latter years of his life or find the concept and reality of transgender individuals bewildering but the fact remains that he won his olympic gold medal fairly , with incredible hard work , and as a man , back in nothing will ever change that and the gender switch , after all the publicity dies down , is her and her family 's business , not ours we can hope that caitlin and the kardashian clan will go live happily ever after off the media radar but there is n't anything we can do about it so why get upset ? if you find yourself riled by the denizens of reality television or sports or , for that matter , by the evening news , stop watching emotional clutter can be old prejudices and beliefs that color your attitudes in a rapidly changing world , weighing you down with anger and fear and resentment i 've heard vitriol flying in our community clubhouse about gay marriage , all things obama and racial resentments of all varieties tempers and blood pressures rise but this is a very different world from the one in which we grew up it is a world , albeit still imperfect and evolving , where one 's sexual orientation or the color of one 's skin does n't automatically preclude the possibility of living a life with full rights as a citizen and while one certainly can take issue with our current president over any number of policies , so much of what pulses through the internet and impassioned community coffee klatches seems based on pure hatred with a sprinkling of fear because he is different this is a world where you can certainly hold religious , political and personal beliefs of value to you and that enhance your ability to live your life with love there is room for constructive debate and a variety of opinions but standing firm with a stubborn that 's the way i was raised can be hazardous to your own health and well being carrying so much fury as the world changes around you can hurt you most of all perhaps a question about the free floating anger and hostility online and otherwise is what purpose does it serve ? is there anything you can do to change a situation or actively embrace a cause ? does it increase your peace of mind ? your happiness ? presidents come and go there are causes where we can make a difference and ones that are truly futile and frustrating knowing the difference between these and acting accordingly can be critical to one 's emotional well being emotional clutter can also mean habits like negative thinking and self talk that is hazardous to your emotional health there is a lot of truth to the saying most of us are about as happy as we make up our minds to be whatever our external circumstances , we have a choice to greet each day or each challenge with hope and optimism or with grim self pity my lifelong friend sister ramona , who will be in october , was showing troubling signs of frailty when i visited her two weeks ago in northern california for her th jubilee the celebration of her th anniversary of taking her vows as a nun i could n't help but notice how thin she was , how her walk has slowed , how her voice as she renewed her vows at the altar was barely a whisper and yet , her eyes lit up and she embraced me with joy when she spotted me in the crowd and when i asked her how she was really she smiled and said oh , i'm okay we 'll talk but i can do everything i was meant to do right now she is still a healer of souls , counseling stanford university students , and a formidable life force getting an award late last year from the unitarian universalist community in the bay area for her leadership in organizing women for peace she has made the decision to live fully every day of her life that is in stark contrast with a woman in our community i 'll call luella luella has a loving husband , a beautiful home and a reasonable amount of financial security she has raised three successful adult children but , instead of counting her blessings , she ruminates on what is n't right in her life her arm hurts she hates her son 's latest girlfriend her cat died four years ago and the memory of that loss is too great to ever consider adopting another and , most of all , she hates arizona it 's ugly and hot and disgusting ! she complains to anyone who will listen i hate it here ! it 's so beige it 's so full of stupid people we moved here to be closer to our kids and now , with their work and such , we 're lucky to see them maybe once a week and everyone here is so stuck up this just sucks big time ! it 's no accident that others in the community keep their contacts and conversations with luella brief and only occasional stopping negative thinking and self talk is n't necessarily easy for many , it 's a well ingrained habit but it can help to listen to yourself , to be aware , when it starts once again listen for patterns and old catch phrases that speak of your disinclination to make positive changes using cognitive behavioral techniques with some of my patients , i used to recommend a rubber band around the wrist , to be snapped at the first sign of a negative thought to signal the need for a change of thoughts in order to stop the downward spiral i remember one patient named ron who laughed softly and looked at me in total disbelief when i suggested this method of thought stopping he did n't say he 'd try it but , over the next few weeks and months , his outlook began to shift it was a slow change , but a steady one he began to lose the fear , anxiety and lack of confidence that had stalled his life and career as we talked one day , he unbuttoned the cuff of his shirt sleeve and showed me his wrist he was wearing a rubber band i thought this was a crazy idea when you first mentioned it , he said , smiling but i decided to try it and it has made me much more aware of my negative thoughts and increased my ability to stop getting into a spiral of pessimism , depression and despair i can probably do all this without the rubber band now but i still wear it to remind myself that i have power over my thoughts i have a choice we all have choices we can choose to keep our emotional lives cluttered with grudges , resentments , pain from the past and negative beliefs about ourselves and others emotional de cluttering is n't necessarily quick or easy it can be a slow process but choosing to do so can be critical to our life satisfaction little by little , we can choose to let go of past hurts and to embrace growth we can choose to limit our exposure to toxic people and ideas we can choose to clear the air , let go of resentment and make peace we can create more space in our emotional lives for loving experiences , for giving to others , for making a difference , for greeting each day with joy
