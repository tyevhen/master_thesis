when i saw my psychiatrist for my regularly scheduled appointment yesterday , she with my collaboration , of course decided it was time to go back to the hospital i was absolutely not functioning well at home i reluctantly agreed to go , knowing it was the safest , wisest decision and here i am inpatient , round two i knew when i left prior to the marathon that this may be a possibility i knew we were all in a hurry up and get better mode so i could cross boston off my bucket list and i'm so glad i was able to go , to run , to have that experience it was the right decision at the time now this is the right decision i need to pursue further interventions to break this cycle of depression i 've not felt well for over weeks now i 've been very lucky i have n't had an episode like this since the spring of that 's six years of relative stability i 've had tough spots , rough spots , and short spins into the hole , but nothing like this and i ca n't continue to be non functional it 's time to do something more something more will likely be ect for those of you unfamiliar , i'm just going to tell you to look it up look on the mayo clinic website for information i do n't have the energy to explain it nor defend it right now i know many of you are probably horrified by the thought images of one flew over the cuckoo 's nest in your head it is , fortunately , nothing like that anymore and the last time i had ect , in the spring of , it obviously worked there are risks to my memory , which is why i will spend the rest of today journaling about the boston experience and writing down every password i have but at this point , the risk is worth the reward my health so that 's where i'm at inpatient i'm staring ect in the face , and ready to do whatever it takes to get to the other side of this depression episode as usual , i appreciate your thoughts and prayers , and i'm grateful for your support
