yesterday was a strange day i awoke feeling low , but i went to my aa meeting anyway perhaps that was a mistake , as i felt incredibly alone in that room full of people on top of that , i had a discussion focused on how i used to use alcohol to fill the emptiness i used to feel , and how sobriety filled that hole , only to realize , as i walked out of the building , that i felt familiarly empty i felt an aching hole in my heart , and i entered my vehicle in tears i drove home , even though i knew it was probably going to be very difficult , and perhaps unsafe , to be alone a better decision would have been to turn right instead of left and drive to my friend wendy 's house alas , i made the decision to return home , and it was tough the ache inside did not abate there was a hole in my heart that incessant ache , usually a knock out punch whenever i feel it , yesterday got me moving instead i found a music station on my directtv , called reality bites , which appropriately plays some head banging , angry music i could not have turned it up much louder ! with that as my background , i set about to clean my house it had n't been really cleaned since i first entered the hospital almost weeks ago and i got it done i thought i would take a nap after cleaning for hours , but the combination of beautiful , sunny weather and heart pounding music motivated me to put on my running clothes rather than my bed clothes i was tired , my mood was low , my motivation to actually run even lower , but out the door i went anyway i ran after miles , my legs were complaining , and i wanted to stop i kept going instead negative depression related thoughts randomly bounced around my sick brain , but i kept running labored breathing and breathlessness made me want to give up i'm not used to breathlessness but i kept running instead at miles , i had the option of turning for home , about miles away , or continuing around a small lake initially , i turned toward home , but i changed my mind and ran around the lake instead tired , breathless , and pleased , i arrived home with miles under my belt like i said , it was a strange day , filled with wildly divergent feelings and a variety of distracting activities , and i did end up driving to my friend wendy 's home after my run , as my brain quickly resumed it 's sickness , but in the end , that aching , empty , hole was filled i'm grateful for that
