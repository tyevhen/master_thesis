so i am getting pretty desperate here i want to have a clone or two of myself , but not of now , of when i was or so this move is going to happen but it will kill me well kill may be an overstatement i ca n't wait until we are in the new house and nothing is left to do in the old house i e february i know a lot will be lost like the stuff outside that is frozen to the ground , it is very cold in canada right now but at least it will be over ok not quite as unpacking , cleaning and painting will still need to be done , but there will not be an urgency for that part , i can take years to complete it if necessary now there is an urgency and all my possessions have to be removed from the old house by a certain date cleaning and possibly painting also has to be done by that date trust me the magnitude of the necessary work is massively daunting for a person with fibromyalgia who has a sprained yes still ankle the reason the ankle is still sprained is that full recovery keeps getting post poned by mini sprains which keep occurring now i think i have developed something called anterior ankle impingement well maybe not , but the pain is similar makes negotiating stairs very difficult this is further complicated by the fact that the stress is making my heart rate go a bazillion miles per minute and i am always out of breath , this need to keep going up and down the stairs is totally exhausting me now i think i am in what is termed as a crash in fibroworld crash is where you fall apart maybe it happens just as the last guest is leaving maybe it happens just as the turkey gets carved you crash and loose all sense of reason sometimes it 's a long crash , like sliding your face ft across a gravel road before you come to a complete stop then you burn , or flare sometimes for days you feel like you 're coming down with the flu , your muscles ache beyond reason and you are completely unfit for company lock the door and throw away the key but in my situation i ca n't stop , i ca n't rest , there is too much to do , too little time i have to keep going to work , i have to keep packing and cleaning i do n't know what i will do on moving day i just do carloads with help , not even having to carry things up and down stairs and i can barely handle it as i write this i am so tired , in so much pain , but only of my day is done my hands and feet are swollen i still have minutes before going home i feel like i am in the middle of a serious flu i am freezing , then sweating , i sneeze , my throat is sore i know this sounds like a whine fest yes i am whining maybe tonight i will take a long hot bath then go to bed rather than do what i am supposed to do maybe taking tonight off will mean i can do move on moving day this saturday maybe i will go take the bath in the new extra deep bathtub for full effect soak the aches and pains away then rest maybe i will take off work early tomorrow to catch up on the missed last minute packing maybe , we 'll see thanks for reading
