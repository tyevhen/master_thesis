i 've always thought that mother 's day should be celebrated by all women ! for all who have n't had children whether by choice or circumstances this one 's for you even if she has never birthed a child , even if she never comes to do so every woman is a mother ! first , of her dolls then , of her little siblings getting married , she 's her husband 's mother before mothering their children if childless , she will become an adoptive mother and will give someone else 's spawn all her love nieces and nephews , children of friends , students , animals , a good cause how many women were n't chosen to mother their own children but ended up mothering their own mothers ? or fathers ? grandparents ? motherhood cannot be suppressed just like a water flow that gets blocked by a stone , it will surely find its way out during war , they care for the injured , even if they wave a different flag or wear a different uniform motherhood has no borders , colors or preferences it 's one of those few things that are sufficient in themselves every woman is a mother !
