thank you so much for your reply and encouragement i know it may take time and that it will get easier i pray that it will soon , and i m committed as i want to choose happiness , i do choose happiness over this hell but right now it 's so painful that my head feels like it 's exploding i keep telling myself , at least i got out of bed this am , went to th gym and trying to occupy my day and keep my focus elsewhere but it really really is painful today for some reason y deary i suggested before that you read viktor frankl 's book man 's search for meaning taylor caldwell 's book growing up tough is also a good one you need to start thinking about other people , even if you do n't know them or , you might start writing your own book a journal or even some fiction of your own you need to discover what is your talent , your craft maybe you are a painter have you ever tried to do oil painting ? many people read detective stories for a distraction , or biographies , and find them good company you are limiting yourself to keeping company with very little other than your depression you are still not convinced that you do n't have to suffer the pain that your brain is digging up for you you can refuse to suffer by turning your brain onto some other line of thinking no matter what you do , yoga , volunteer work , reading , or whatever , nothing works if you are not thinking about what you are doing and , instead , are constantly turning to self focus in a deadly fascination with what you are feeling it is not necessary to be so fascinated by what you are feeling it is a terribly destructive bad habit you should start ignoring what you are feeling the pain is all self generated even though it feels like an overwhelming force it is not an overwhelming force you are more than your brain you are you and your brain is your brain and your brain is supposed to be your obedient servant , not your master you are continuing to give your brain the wrong directions but do n't get discouraged , either you have made a stand and sooner or later , if you are earnest about it , you will prevail a b curtiss dear a b i feel like i 've been slapped in the face by you i am really giving all my effort at this the past few days i'm just not there yet , and have n't been successful at snapping out like some have and i have started to look at distractions and good company activities ive read vf s book before but will reread it and the other book you suggest i will prevail , for sure ! y dear y i'm sorry if i was too rough i do n't want to discourage you by pushing too hard i am on your side and want the best for you i do know how painful it is and i want you out of it as fast as possible if you stick to it you will be successful i remember someone saying once , it does n't matter how long it takes you to learn a song , it matters how beautifully you sing it a b dear a b i knew your intentions are only to help but i was just about to write that i felt you were being too harsh thank you for this last email , it deeply touches me that you want the best for me and am on my side , and know the pain i will prevail and get out if this ! thank you for all your advise and wisdom always with gratitude and love , y dear y i must not forget that i have a very small expertise to help people out of depression i do not know everything about them so the best i can do since my expertise is limited , is to accompany you on your journey which i have already taken and point out the small obstacles , rather than rudely drag you over to my path we each have our own unique journey to take and we all must be careful how we come to one another 's aid but your letter did remind me of something that happened in graduate school many years ago i fellow classmate said she went in to talk to her professor when she went in for her conference , the first thing he said to her was someone has hurt you very badly and you better get over it quick she said she was totally shocked so i guess i was kind prepared for my own conference with the same professor he said to me you are a very afraid person my answer was yes , i know and he responded very kindly , and that can change now , after all these years , i wonder if my classmate felt a little bit like you did after my last email a b
