over on clinical psychiatry news , roy is writing about using the color lime for mental illness awareness do check it out apparently it works for lyme disease , lymphoma , and muscular dystrophy , too , but here in psych we like to be inclusive and co morbidity is always an issue if you took my poll on patient searches or helped with comments i can use for quotes , thank you so much the survey results are here , please remember these are not science , not even a little , and i left it to the reader to define strip search so it 's really just a snapshot were you strip searched upon admission ? yes no if you answered yes were you a voluntary patient at the time of admission ? yes no if you answered yes what type of hospital were you in ? private psychiatric hospital a psychiatric unit of a community hospital a state psychiatric hospital a state hospital specificially for forensic court ordered patients if you answered yes , did you find the experience of being strip searched to be very distressing ? i hope no one is offended that i discussed two things in one post i know people were offended in the past , but late on a friday , you only get two posts when my salary for this goes up if i'm not back , have a great weekend
