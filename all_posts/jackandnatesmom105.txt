as a mom , it s always upsetting when you feel sick or for some reason unable to care for your little guys my migraines really reached a breaking point for me this week , and it was time to take action or more action last week , i went to the eye doctor check , and the dentist check all was well there i started doing yoga yes , me yoga ! that time of the month thing that makes my migraines take flight was over i felt like i should be in the clear so why did i wake up at am on wednesday morning with searing pain on the left side of my head again ? no amount of imitrex aleve cold hot deep breathing was going to help this one there have been very few times since jack was born that i have waved the white flag and said honey i am out of commission this was one of these times i even called my doctor , accepted her prescription of hydrocodone which i haven t taken yet and made an appointment with the neurologist luckily , i was able to see him quickly as in am thursday he asked a bit about my stressors and triggers and looked at me like duh lady , of course you have migraines well , i know , but i can t live like this anymore i just don t have time for it he suggested going off birth control are ya crazy ? ? ? and anyway , these started before that did the only abnormal on my exam was a slightly decreased deep tendon reflex in the l arm he didn t seem concerned he gave me a daily script for migraine prophylaxis , told me to follow up in two weeks and if things aren t improved then it will be mri time fair enough he prescribed amitriptyline it s a tricyclic antidepressant and for that usage it s usually dosed at mg day , but apparently in low doses it has been very effective for migraine prophylaxis along with a slew of other chronic pain issues have i mentioned that i am pretty drug na ve ? he prescribed mg i took it at about midnight , as it is supposed to cause drowsiness umm , yep , try hours of drowsiness and dizziness not very easy to focus on a computer screen when you re dizzy the upside is that despite these side effects , one important thing was missing a headache ! so that is really good news i think i will try taking a half tonight to see if maybe that would be a better middle of the road type dose for me i am grateful for the relief , that s for sure , but if i m asleep all the time or half way there , it s not really making me more productive now is it ? thank you to my hubby he handled the duties on thursday quite nicely , getting people ready for and off to school , and getting them to ot at night he did admit that he was exhausted last night ha sometimes role reversal can be very good for a relationship i know that after he walks a day in my shoes john usually has an increased level of respect for what i do hmmm maybe i should try going to the office sometime ?
