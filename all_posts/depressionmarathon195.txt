i do n't have depression as a result of a character defect it is not because i am weak , ineffectual , or not participating appropriately in life i do n't have depression because i do n't know how to manage my free time i do n't have depression because i am working too little or too much i do n't have depression because i do n't know every cognitive behavioral therapy technique in the book i do n't have depression because i am not using my skills effectively enough to combat it i do n't have depression because i'm not attending enough meetings it is not because i'm too smart or not smart enough i do n't have depression because i'm not attending the right therapeutic group i can be doing all of these things correctly and still have depression it is not the result of a character defect i have depression specifically , i have major depression , recurrent , severe without psychotic features the icd billing code is it is an illness of my brain it comes and goes , varies in severity , but basically remains a chronic condition i do my best to deal with on a regular basis right now my depression is particularly virulent and treatment resistant that does n't mean i'm at fault sometimes treatment simply does n't work this is true for many chronic conditions cancer patients sometimes fill their bodies with pure poison , yet the cancer persists people with diabetes sometimes eat exactly the right food and still require insulin to maintain healthy stability despite rest and medications , those with ms still have days where they find it difficult to move and my treatment resistant depression can wage battle with ect treatments , hospitalizations , and multiple medication changes yet leave me sad , depleted , and debilitated that does n't mean i 've done something wrong , or not well enough , or that i need to attend more groups i'm tired i'm tired of this illness and it 's debilitating impact on my life of course i want to be well again ! but i'm not not yet and therein lies the problem i'm especially tired of the judgments and stigma which surround me when i do n't feel better as quickly as those around me think i should i'm tired of attending groups others think i should attend simply because they have no other solution i'm frustrated with remedial group instruction to do this and do that , as if that 's not something i 've already considered or tried ! for example , obviously if ect treatments did n't work then keeping a written schedule in a day planner is certainly the solution ! i do n't blame the group leaders perhaps they 're frustrated , too they 're doing the best they can with what they know , but a day planner ? really ? would you suggest the same as a cure to a cancer patient ? would you tell a fatigued ms patient to just get up and get going ? acting opposite to your emotion is always the way to go ! maybe i do my best forcing myself to move , but to be told to do so by a smiley faced group leader with no clue as to what depression feels like is more than a bit invalidating i'm tired of being invalidated i'm tired of the dismissive messages that i'm not doing enough , not trying hard enough , not acting in a way which will cure my depression do n't get me wrong i'm willing to put in the effort i'm daily doing what i can do but i have depression it is an illness i hate it it totally fucks up my life , and i 'd do anything to get rid of it but please understand my resistance to another happy , remedial group i'm tired of happy , remedial groups which suggest i'm just not doing enough i'm doing enough , and i'm still sick i'm willing to do my part i'm willing to continue working to mitigate this damn illness more than anything i want my life back forgive me if i do n't agree my way back must necessarily go through your time management group
