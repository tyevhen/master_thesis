sticking with the hate theme from yesterday , today is the perfect day to discuss borderline personality disorder the national alliance on mental illness nami sent me an e news alert today requesting support for a bill which would recognize bpd awareness month follow the link below to check it out for yourself borderline awareness month and with that simple alert , i have now experienced in just a few months three things i never thought i 'd see in my lifetime ! are you kidding me , borderline personality disorder awareness month nationwide ? in case you are wondering , the first two things i never thought i 'd see have to do with a woman , a black man and the u s presidency my shock is justified bpd is not only one of the most misunderstood psychological diagnosis , but it is also one of the most dreaded and hated ! in my time as a mental health professional and patient , i have seen this diagnosis used like a garbage can it was routinely slapped on patients who spoke up too much , disagreed too often , were difficult to deal with or simply rubbed the practitioner myself included the wrong way it was , and still is used almost as a punishment the thinking seems to go something like this you wo n't do what we want you to do you keep coming back to the hospital you are not getting better , and i do n't enjoy working with you ! therefore , you must be borderline ouch ! i often question whether the diagnose er even understands the actual dsm criteria on which the diagnosis is actually based as a patient , and those of you who read my earliest posts know about my own diagnosis with bpd , this label essentially assures professional maltreatment at least once in your future i , unfortunately , have several juicy , disgusting examples i could provide entering an emergency room for mental illness is fascinating when bpd is on your chart without actually having a clue , i immediately knew when the person who was treating me gained the knowledge of my past medical history the change from concerned healthcare professional to scolding , you 're wasting my time parent was hard to miss despite psychological testing , psychiatric documentation , and even personal phone calls from several of my providers , i had a social worker who never believed i had depression at all as far as she was concerned , i was a spoiled brat with a serious personality disorder that last statement was made to my tearful mother who could not understand how her despondent , almost lifeless daughter got taken to court and then stuck in a horrid state mental hospital think one flew over the cuckoo 's nest miles from home after a serious suicide attempt it was the ultimate punishment the social worker could reign , and my mother and i believe she was quite proud of her accomplishment it was a small county with no other options , and ultimately i had to move out of the county , at great personal and emotional expense , just to receive fair and compassionate care fair and compassionate care is not typical for people branded with borderline but , when i spoke up and demanded better services , i was being difficult and reinforcing the diagnosis when i could no longer fight for what i needed , i felt like the shamed puppy who piddled on the carpet , and my depression worsened it does n't have to be like that , but it is even today , after dialectical behavior training and lots of practice , i still carry this diagnosis although i no longer officially qualify perhaps that is one of the biggest misconceptions about bpd it feels like a death sentence stamped on your forehead , but it 's not ! it is totally treatable and changeable ! and it is totally within the power of the afflicted individual to cure it ! i did n't know that ! and unfortunately , i do n't think most doctors , therapists , social workers , etc know that ! if i could get rid of my depression by learning some new skills , perfecting them with practice , and integrating them into my daily life , i would have been cured a long time ago ! ! that 's what i did with bpd , and i no longer suffer yes , people with this diagnosis are suffering from it because of dbt and some hard work my life is easier today until i have to go to the hospital , that is , where i am still branded with bpd they do n't know me they do n't know i 've changed , and it 's easier to keep writing down that diagnosis and treating me as if than to actually sit down and properly evaluate and diagnose me of course they could take my psychiatrist 's word for it , or my psychologist 's word for it , or my social worker 's word for it ahhh , but that 's a discussion for another time congrats nami on making borderline personality disorder awareness a priority at some point the hating has to stop and the understanding must begin related post it all started when
