it 's summer the sky is sunny i have a lot of yard projects and every weekend there 's a party somewhere so finding time to read my recovery books has been a challenge yet , as my group leader often says , it does n't matter if you read an entire chapter or just a paragraph as long as you stay in the daily habit i do become a little stressed about not finishing a chapter , but really that is quite silly the stranger in the brain talking nonsense to make my mental health a business , as dr low said , i really need to find some time to read mental health through will training more often ! hmm , maybe outside
