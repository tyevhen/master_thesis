i ve been asked some variation on are you going to college ? more times than i can count , and i don t generally give a more elaborate answer than no occasionally , when pressed , i say that what i want to be doing cooking ! doesn t require a degree or that i m doing more interesting things to me than going to school but when i was asked that question online recently , i finally wrote a response that explains in more detail why i m not going to university , and that response has been re worked into this post you can also find this article posted over at cooperative catalyst so , am i ever going to go to university ? i don t like to say never , because lots of things change , but i definitely can t see myself going to university full time or for a degree in the foreseeable future i m sort of vaguely considering just taking a class or two sometime in the next year , or maybe , possibly , going to culinary school at some point , but i haven t really made any decisions on either of those possibilities yet why don t i want to go ? as for why i don t plan on going to university full time , i have many reasons a list of bullet point reasons , even there is nothing i want to be doing right now as a job or career or whatever that would require a degree , so the only reason and this is a good reason to go to university for many people ! would be for pure enjoyment learning purposes , which leads me to i m not very into more academic subjects , as a rule most of the things i enjoy doing tend to be really tactile and immediate i like cooking and gardening and having one on one conversations sure , i like reading about feminism and social justice and radical education hell , a major focus of my life for a few years was reading and talking and writing about unschooling ! but i sort of feel that what i really want and need to be doing in my life right now is just that doing , not studying i don t enjoy learning for the sake of learning and having said that i swear i can almost hear a horrified gasp from lots of people in my unschooling community for me to enjoy and take in information or learn a skill well , it has to feel genuinely important and relevant in my life and or the lives of the people close to me , my community , etc i m very happily reading through a large book on fermentation sandor ellix katz is awesome because i want to be fermenting more foods and beverages i m going to pick up a really awesome looking book the forager s harvest by samuel thayer on wild edibles soon , because i want to be foraging a lot more with my sister come spring social justice issues , radical politics , and radical sustainability are important because i want to be a good person , act in as kind and non oppressive a way as possible , live in a genuinely sustainable way , etc university has always seemed to me to be so incredibly removed from the rest of the world , and i really don t want that , or think that that removal is generally a healthy thing i hate how inaccessible academia is both the price , though that is at least less of an issue where i am than many other places , but also the very language and culture of universities and academia though i ve seen and been bothered by this on multiple occasions , a specific instance that stands out to me was one time when i was at a talk , and this one dude just started bringing up objections and questions in the most ridiculously academic language you can imagine , and referencing books and authors i d never heard of as the conversation between the speaker an academic herself and the audience member continued , i had absolutely no clue what they were talking about and i say this as someone who is generally read as well educated by people unaware of my being an unschooler , since then of course folks start to think otherwise , a native english speaker , and someone usually considered skilled with words it just hit me very profoundly that if this seemed inaccessible to me , how much more inaccessible is it to so very many other people ? it just doesn t sit right with me also , when i think of being in classrooms for some four years or more , i feel like i d be trapped i m literally mildly horrified at the idea it does not sound appealing at all there are more personal reasons , and there are far more nuanced critiques of the institution of university to be found out there but from my perspective , those things are a very good overview of why i have no plans or desire to go to university really , there are so many more interesting to me things i want to be doing right now in my life , things that are relevant and exciting and hands on no classrooms needed i say university not college because here in quebec , college also known as cegep is a between high school and university thing , and is not synonymous with university in quebec the average tuition per year is , source http www statcan gc ca tables tableaux sum som l cst educf eng htm you might also like so you want to leave college now what ?
