a longstanding open problem in biology is why the g c guanine plus cytosine content of dna varies so much across taxonomic groups in theory , the amounts of the four bases in dna adenine , guanine , cytosine , and thymine should be roughly equal , and regression to the mean should drive all organisms to a genomic g c content of that 's not what we find in some organisms , like mycobacterium tuberculosis , the g c content is , whereas in others , like clostridium botulinum the botulism organism the g c content is only we know that , in general , g c content correlates not perfectly , though with large genome size , in bacteria very low g c content usually means a smaller genome size , and in fact tiny intracellular parasites and symbionts like buchnera aphidicola the aphid endosymbiont have some of the lowest g c contents of all at it 's not hard to understand the presence of low gc organisms , since it 's well known that most transition mutations are gc to at transitions the high prevalence of mutations in the direction of a t has often been called at drift but some organisms go the other way , developing unusually high g c content in their genomes , indicating that something must be counteracting at drift in those organisms recently , a group of chinese scientists see wu et al , on the molecular mechanism of gc content variation among eubacterial genomes , biology direct , , has advanced the notion that high g c content is due , specifically , to the presence of the dnae gene , which codes for a low fidelity dna repair polymerase this gene , they say , drives a t pairs to become g c pairs during the low fidelity dna repair that goes on in certain bacteria in times of stress not all bacteria contain the dnae polymerase wu et al discuss their theory in some detail in a january article in the isme journal in earlier genomic studies of my own , i curated a list of eubacterial species in which no species occurs twice , spanning a wide range of g c values when i learned of the dnae hypothesis of wu et al , i decided to check it against my own curated collection of organisms the first thing i did was go to uniprot org and do a search on dnae some hits came back in the search , but many hits were for proteins inferred to be dna polymerase iii alpha subunits , not necessarily of the dnae variety in order to eliminate false positives , i decided to restrict my search to just bonafide dnae entries that have been reviewed that immediately cut the number of hits down to but among the hits , some species were listed more than once due to entries for multiple strains of the organism i unduplicated the list at the species level and ended up with unique species at this point , i wrote a little javascript code to check each of the organisms in my curated list against the known dnae containing organisms obtained from uniprot there were matches the matches are plotted in red in the graph below click image to enlarge in this plot , genome a t content a taxonomic metric is on the x axis and coding region purine content is on the y axis n the points in red represent organisms that possess a dnae error prone polyerase see text for discussion this graph plots a t content which of course is just one minus the g c content on the horizontal axis , against coding region purine content a g on the vertical axis for more information on the significance of coding region purine content , see my previous posts here and here it 's not important , though , for the present discussion notice that the red points tend to occur on the left side of the graph , in the area of high g c low a t content the red dot furthest to the right represents the genome of saccharophagus degradans only out of dnae positive organisms have g c content below a t above the rest have genomes rich in g c this is , of course , just a quick , informal test a sanity check , if you will of the wu hypothesis regarding dnae which is a repair polymerase not needed for normal dna replication , nor possessed by all bacteria various types of sampling errors could invalidate these results also , the wu hypothesis itself is open to criticism on the grounds that correlation does not prove causation nevertheless , it 's an interesting hypothesis and a random check of dnae positive species in my collection of organisms tends to provide at least anecdotal verification of the wu theory that dnae causes drift toward high g c content of course , wu 's theory does not explain the wide range of g c contents observed in organisms other than bacteria there is no dnae in eukaryotes , for example the general notion , however , that genomic g c content tends to be a reflection of the components of a cell 's repairosome the enzyme systems used in repairing dna has substantial merit , i think on that score , be sure to see my earlier analysis of how the presence or absence of an ogg gene influences coding region purine content here , by the way , are the dnae containing organisms that show up as red dots in the graph above agrobacterium tumefaciens agrobacterium vitis alkalilimnicola ehrlichii anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans
