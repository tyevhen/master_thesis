just to share an interesting piece from this morning 's new york times magazine in the moral instinct , steven pinker writes about the factors that influence our thoughts and feelings about what we find admirable , despicable , acceptable , and moral in the context of our society he asks some tantalizing questions , though it 's a long piece and near the end he lost me for a bit before he found me again always fun , pinker talks about a college professor i did a work study project with about a zillion years ago dr paul rozin studies cultural influences in food tastes and he was quoted in the article in a discussion about moral issues related to vegetarianism given clinkshrink 's recent post about prison food and cannibals , i wondered why she was n't interviewed just a couple paragraphs that i found interesting dozens of things that past generations treated as practical matters are now ethical battlegrounds , including disposable diapers , i q tests , poultry farms , barbie dolls and research on breast cancer food alone has become a minefield , with critics sermonizing about the size of sodas , the chemistry of fat , the freedom of chickens , the price of coffee beans , the species of fish and now the distance the food has traveled from farm to plate many of these moralizations , like the assault on smoking , may be understood as practical tactics to reduce some recently identified harm but whether an activity flips our mental switches to the moral setting isn t just a matter of how much harm it does we don t show contempt to the man who fails to change the batteries in his smoke alarms or takes his family on a driving vacation , both of which multiply the risk they will die in an accident driving a gas guzzling hummer is reprehensible , but driving a gas guzzling old volvo is not eating a big mac is unconscionable , but not imported cheese or cr me br l e the reason for these double standards is obvious people tend to align their moralization with their own lifestyles i will say , though , when pinker talks about research on ethical behavior in monkeys the impulse to avoid harm , which gives trolley ponderers the willies when they consider throwing a man off a bridge , can also be found in rhesus monkeys , who go hungry rather than pull a chain that delivers food to them and a shock to another monkey i had to wonder about the morals of a scientist who could even design such a study
