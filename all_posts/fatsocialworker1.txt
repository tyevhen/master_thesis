so , i used to be the queen of long winded facebook arguments , especially when it came to weight issues these days i mostly ignore facebook , and i choose to unfriend or hide people who say ridiculous things about weight issues mostly because emotionally , it 's frustrating recently , my roomie bff has been drawn in to a facebook argument on someone else 's wall i 've tried to shy away from it , buuuut it did n't work she sent me access to the status , and i 've been reading through it , giving her ideas for responses , and even tried to write my own response the response became so big i decided i may as well just write something here it all started over those deplorable anti obesity ads which feature children front and center , and say shit like , it 's hard to be a little girl when you 're not or whatever first of all , there 's lots of reasons why being a kid sucked , and let me tell you , as a big little girl , the only problem my weight caused me was the way other people treated me because of it , and that sure as shit was n't my mother 's fault but anyway , these arguments are usually the same when these issues come up , especially when you begin discussing children having a fat child means you are abusing your child no , it does n't i was a fat kid i can speak from first hand experience that being a fat kid does not mean your parents are feeding you badly , let alone abusing you i was always fat , my younger brother was always rail thin i was probably fatter than most of those kids in the ads , and my mom made me eat fresh vegetables yuck and all that crap i had three meals a day , generally solid , good food but i was still fat was my mom secretly stuffing twinkies down my throat when i was n't looking ? to my dismay , she was not this will actually convince parents to feed their children better one , this is assuming that parents who want to feed their children are n't already trying , but their kid is still fat because they have a metabolism of fluffernutter like i did do this also assumes that parents who do n't give a shit will all of a sudden give a shit let 's face it if they did n't give a shit with the fat child in front of them , it 's going to take a lot more than a billboard to change that years of therapy , maybe , but we have n't really achieved the kind of mental health parity it will take to make change in all shitty parents these kids have eating disorders being fat is not an eating disorder most leading experts in eating disorders agree on this you cannot assume an eating disorder by looking at a person just as you cannot assume a skinny person is anorexic , you ca n't assume a fat person overeats weight science is way more complicated than you overeat you 're fat however , weight based bullying can lead to eating disorders later in life a look at the literature will show that there is a correlation between weight based bullying and the on set of eating disorders as in the diagnosable kind from the dsm later in life i 'd consider these billboards to be a type of bullying , personally all people have the same opportunities to raise their child in the same way i often hear from people oh my family was poor and i still got x , y and z so there is no excuse why everyone ca n't do that this is usually a bunch of shit from someone who refuses to acknowledge that they have any privilege look , i hear that your family was on welfare or food stamps , but welfare and food stamps in an area such as , oh i do n't know , tonawanda , ny is not the same as welfare or food stamps somewhere like east new york , brooklyn in tonawanda , you do n't really have to go very far to find fresh food to spend those food stamps on in east new york , you may not be able to find fresh food for a few subway stops i 've had to carry fresh food for myself on a subway , and that is without kids hanging off of me it 's difficult this also assumes being able to afford a metrocard , and i 've worked with many people who ca n't afford those things and so , it 's a little easier to walk to the bodaga and get a box of mac and cheese that is just reality , and trying to argue with that because your experience was different is stupid it 's stupid to make assumptions about how everyone on welfare or food stamps has the same opportunities because your experience was ideal if you have the urge to respond with , oh but really , my experience was that bad , check yourself because it 's always worse somewhere else for serious everyone knows what good nutrition is nope they do n't for one , they may not have been taught good nutrition , but they turned out okay , so they 're feeding their child the way they were fed two , many americans lack a basic education some people ca n't read , let alone understand the food pyramid and yet you think this mean campaign is going to teach them something ? it 's not i'm glad that you were raised in a nurturing environment where doing things like attending school and paying attention in school were possible , but having spent some time in a inner city public school , i can tell you that is not the case everywhere again y'all , do not assume people 's experiences other methods are not working , so we need to take more extreme measures dude , how quickly do you expect , even if you assume it is possible which i really do n't for reasons that are n't that fat people are lazy and fat kids have terrible parents , for the obesity epidemic to disappear ? it 's not like you have a few let 's move psas and kids shrink the next day there has n't been nearly enough time for anything else to work , so why do we have to so quickly resort to name calling and being assholes ? the term obesity epidemic has really only been in our vernacular a few years have some patience shame does not yield results it never does scientificially , it will actually lead to a lot of the icky stuff we all supposedly hate about obesity like heart disease and diabetes a good place to read about that is in an article titled the stigma of obesity , published in a peer review journal you know what those are , right ? because the health at every size movement is just pandering to fat people who are too lazy to change and is not based in science i do n't know what people consider science these days , but i consider studies that have lived up to the process of being peer reviewed for revered journals to be close enough to science you know , that whole evidence based practice thing ? yeah here 's a bunch of citations bacon , l , aphramor , l weight science evaluating the evidence for a paradigm shift , nutrition journal , , bacon , l , vanloan m , stern js , keim n size acceptance and intuitive eating improve health for obese female chronic dieters journal of american dietetic association bacon , l , keim , n l , van loan , m d , derricote , m , gale , b , kazaks , a , and stern , j s , evaluating a non diet wellness intervention for improvement of metabolic fitness , psychological well being and eating and activity behaviors international journal of obesity , , other relevant reading weight based victimization toward overweight adolescents observations and reactions of peers http www yaleruddcenter org resources upload docs what bias victiminationpeerobservations jsh pdf weight stigmatization toward youth a significant problem in need of societal solutions http www yaleruddcenter org resources upload docs what bias weightstigmayouth childhoodobesity pdf you know , just to start the thing is , i do n't think anyone disagrees that movement and good foods are good for kids pretty sure no one disagrees on that i think we all just disagree about the best way to go about getting those results shaming children and parents , based on my experience and what i 've learned , does not work most parents are fully aware of the fact that they are not feeding their children as well as they would like , and face barriers to deny that parents have barriers is to be ignorant if you want to be ignorant , i allow you the right , but i will not engage in civil discussion with you also , some parents just do n't care and you will not make these parents care with these ads you will just hurt the kids who look a lot like those kids in the advertisement not to mention the actual kids depicted in the ads they will identify with these images and see themselves as a burden and a problem i can only speculate as to what this will lead to , but based on what i know about developmental psychology , it probably is n't good and that 's about it agree to disagree , world , if we must , but i really wish we could just agree that being fucking mean really does n't work , and we should probably just stop with that nonsense
