the trouble with the literature on nicotine , tobacco , vaping , and smoking cessation is that you ca n't trust any of it , basically sponsor bias taints the vast majority of reports , and the whole subject of smoking is so politicized , so rife with agendas , sacred cows , etc , that it 's almost impossible to tell up from down an aspire kit with usb charger , replacement igniters , and everything else you need , is only about you 'll often read , for example , that there are hidden dangers to vaping which is nonsense , as far as i can tell a japanese report from famously said e cigs can put out ten times more formaldehyde than regular cigarettes , for example which turns out to be false read about it here and here i 've been unable to find any credible evidence whatsoever that vaping is harmful certainly , it will be a long time before anyone shows it to be anywhere near as harmful as cigarette smoking the main ingredient of vape juice is propylene glycol , which is not to be confused with the much more toxic ethylene glycol although frankly , ethylene glycol 's toxicity is not as great as most people imagine in poisoning cases , children and animals typically drink many ounces of the stuff , because it tastes so sweet propylene glycol is used in asthma inhalers , so the idea that it 's going to damage your lungs is somewhat fanciful , to put it mildly you 'll sometimes hear it said that e cigs are not proven effective in helping people quit smoking not true one recent literature review found that of e cig users quit smoking , which is a lot by comparison , the success rate for nicotine gum is about barely better than cold turkey cessation , at , versus the patch at around the literature on wellbutrin and chantix is tainted and thoroughly unreliable , imho read it if you want wellbutrin gave me heart palpitations , and chantix which has been implicated in hundreds of suicide attempts made me go psychotic i ca n't recommend the drugs the bottom line , as i said in an earlier post , is that a vapor pen or e cig , if you must is not a direct replacement for a cigarette your body wo n't be fooled if you try to use it that way , you 'll be disappointed if you treat the vape pen as its own special beast , you may very well find it satisfying i do my strong advice is to stay away from the cigalike products that look like a cigaret invest instead to in a decent pen with a rechargeable battery and replaceable heating element i happen to like the aspire products , replacement parts for which can be obtained online quite inexpensively if you decide to invest in a pen , here 's what you need to know you 'll need e juice juices come in thousands of flavors , and several nicotine grades if you are or were a serious smoker , do n't waste time on low dosage juices go for the strongest grade of juice , and if it 's too strong which it wo n't be , work your way down if you 're a smoker , you 'll probably want to choose an e juice with lots of brown notes sample a few flavors tobacco , butterscotch , caramel , etc most vape shops are happy to let you sample as many flavors as you want take home a couple of dark flavors and a couple of fruity flavors you 'll know in a day or two which ones you like expect to pay no more than per ml vial if you 're paying more than that , shop around in l a , i can buy vape juice on any street corner , often for as little as or one ml vial lasts me a week the sweet , caramelly flavors and some of the menthols , too tend to gum up , carbonize , and burn out wicks coils , igniters quickly , so be sure to ask your juice dealer what the best flavors are for long igniter life they 'll know feel free to mix flavors i was a menthol smoker , so i often mix menthol e juice with another flavor if it turns out you like one of the heavy flavors that burns out coils fast , cut it back with a plain vanilla flavor of some kind mix it up mix peach and menthol add cherry to rad bull a red bull taste alike add chocolate chip cookie dough flavor yes , you can buy it to butterscotch find the flavor and nicotine combo that works for you most heating elements coils , igniters have some cotton in them some have a fiber wick i do n't like wicks i use the aspire bvc style coil , which lasts longer after installing a new igniter which you 'll do about once every to days , or whenever the vapor starts to taste skunky , let the juice soak in for a minute or two before drawing your first puff otherwise you could burn out the dry igniter prematurely makes sense , right ? you can get a usb battery charger very inexpensively under , so by all means get a charger and get two batteries , and keep one battery charging on your computer while you use the other one nowadays , you can buy a fancy milliampere hour battery for that 'll last two days or more between charges , but i still prefer to have a pair of less expensive mah batteries that last about six hours , each , for me and switch off between them that way i can misplace one , use the other , puff until i find the first one , then lose the second one repeat until insane vape shops charge a hefty markup on everything , which is why they 're oh so happy to see you when you walk through the door my advice ? get used to buying replacement parts online you 'll save or more vape juice feels greasy , but actually contains no oils it 's just glycerine and glycol , which means it 'll wash out of fabrics if your pen ever gets sticky , it 'll clean right up with a wet paper towel i budget a week for e juice , a week for igniters a pack costs online , and every two months for a new battery my former habit marlboro menthols and the occasional clove used to set me back to a day and made my clothes stink , my teeth yellow , etc , so you do the math anti vapers can say what they want about vaping to me , there 's no question that vape pens are better for you than cigarettes , and the whole argument about whether vaping is a proven effective way to quit smoking is a bit moot , because consumers have voted with their wallets and purses , and the verdict is in vaping is here to stay , in a big way also see to vape or not to vape , and nicotine is not the enemy a big thank you to all the great people who retweeted me yesterday buy my books or click to find out more , at least have you added your name to our mailing list ?
