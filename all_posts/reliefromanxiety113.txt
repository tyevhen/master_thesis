comparison and competition on a daily basis can be hard enough without the influence of social media however , social media is such a huge and normal part of our lives that sometimes i do n't think we can see the damage it is doing throughout the years of my mental illness journey , i have noticed that i have't always been at the same stage as my peers and this can be another mental battle to add to the list using social media on a regular basis has given me the information to feed this comparison culture that many of us have engrained this not to say that social media is bad , because i find it very useful i am constantly using it and it 's a great way to keep up to date , share photos and meet other like minded people i think it 's great ! but , as reminder , we have to look at the issues it can create the main point here is that people pick and choose what goes on social media and generally speaking it is the best bits you do n't see the bad days , the things that did n't go too well or the break ups you see the good bits the holidays , the passing of driving tests , the academic success and the closeness that they have with friends of course , even this can be fa ade they may hardly speak to their 'facebook' friends for example social media to an extent must be taken with a pinch of salt and with an understanding that this person 's life that looks so perfect , is only a snippet and on a lot of occasions may only be for the show of virtual friends in this way , the comparisons we make with another may not be accurate nor fair it 's also important to remind yourself that you are on your own journey , and the 'race is only with yourself ' do n't get me wrong , we can all get caught in this trap however , when social media starts to do damage with comparisons and competition to our mental health , it 's time to take a break and remember that no one 's life is perfect and social media can be fake what do you think ? amy xx
