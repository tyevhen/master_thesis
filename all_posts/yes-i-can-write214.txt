i forget how much i love writing poetry when i do n't do it for too long forget how satisfying , frustrating , joy bringing , and difficult it is to simply get a few lines out of my head and on to a sheet of paper , or a computer screen i find poetry far more difficult than prose , and i find i'm far more insecure with what i come up with probably because i consider myself much better at prose than poetry ! but either way , i love writing poetry it satisfies something in me , that no other art form does so , i wanted to share a few poems i 've written in the last few months as spring is now here , i think this poem , written on february st , is seasonally appropriate do you remember when we used to catch tadpoles ? their bodies slimy smooth and soft tails strong remember when we 'd let them go , after a little while ? they 'd dart away quickly into the murky shadows and we 'd go home spattered in mud smelling of pond scum and fresh air and happiness do you remember , now ? on march th , angry and frustrated with the state of the world as i often am , i wrote this poem , entitled broken pavement to find the secret way beside the voices whispering of heretics traitors mother culture holds us close we must walk the winding paths away from the highways , sidewalks , sticky hot asphalt where blueberries grow and you can eat the cattails waving in the passing breezes avoid the institutions , corporate long grey hallways i ll find the old buildings reclaimed by love life life and camp , by a stream that fish still follow while i watch beauty escape in ruins finally , truly free the stars will find me and finally , i 've been having trouble writing any poetry whatsoever lately , so though i do n't even like the finished product much at all , i was very proud of myself for managing to get over that block and write this poem yesterday ! why ? i ask watching from behind the blinds as someone rides by blocking out the world with two small earbuds i know the certainty of holding back like the boy on the bicycle staying hidden content in containment of self risk gets forgotten pushed carefully to the back of the closet where i do n't have to look at it and can almost almost forget it 's existence dancing in confinement starts to feel like freedom after a while but risk is always there even when i close my eyes tightly thinking of warm places and sweet darkness i feel the pull longing for something spicy dangerous sparkling eyes and bitten lips strange streets and breathless laughter distant dreamlike reality seems so mundane , sometimes life something that happens on the other side of the glass not for me but yesterday , i opened the door just for a moment the sunshine smelled like adventure thank you for reading ! peace , idzie
