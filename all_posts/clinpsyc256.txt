i ll open this post with some context i really think john mack has done great work at the pharma blogosphere and pharma marketing blog sites however , that does not mean i always agree with his arguments i m not putting up this post in an attempt to start a cat fight with the good mr mack i just have to express my dissent many bloggers linked to peter rost s blog last week , and with damn good reason he posted an excellent three part series regarding a pfizer whistleblower and , making it yet more interesting , voodoo was allegedly involved mack took issue with bloggers linking to rost , pointing out accurately that most who linked to rost had little to add i linked to rost and admit that i added nothing to rost s story mack then stated that the reason fellow bloggers linked to rost was because they wanted to increase their visibility , as rost was nice enough to link back to sites that posted links to his site well , allow me to differ do i like getting a little added traffic from rost ? you bet i ll take all the traffic i can get but that is not the main reason i linked the story i linked it because it is interesting and because i thought my readers should be exposed to it the more exposure such a story gets , the better after all , it appears that one thing that many pharma related sites have in common is to shine light on dubious industry practices thus , i see linking to a blogger who is doing good investigative work as a large part of my blogging duties am i missing something ?
