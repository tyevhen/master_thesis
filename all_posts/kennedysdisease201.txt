i pulled the trigger this week and bought a van with the vmi northstar system i have been looking , comparing , and procrastinating for over six months now and the right deal finally came along about two weeks ago a honda odyssey ex became available for sale by owner the can only had , miles on it since i am a honda fan , the vehicle appealed to me immediately i drove it , kicked the tires , asked a bunch of questions , negotiated a price , and bought it i must say that my initial impression of the vmi system is very positive it appears to be well thought out and user friendly i am having an ez lock system installed on monday this will allow me to ride up the ramp and into the driver s position , lock the chair in , and drive away it also allows me to use the original six way power seat if i am so inclined yesterday i did something that i normally would never do i read the manual both honda and vmi i am glad i did because the ex has a lot of bells and whistles similar to my town and country limited the braun joey has served me well and i recommend it as a good system to haul around a chair that the back can fold down however , it no longer allowed me the freedom i need nor is a fit for my new wheelchair the vmi system is the next step up for me that allows me to retire my jazzy i will let you know how i like the vmi system in the months ahead if you have any experience with that system , i would appreciate any tips on maintenance or any other suggestions that might help a novice like me
