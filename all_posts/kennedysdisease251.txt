as i mention in my blog introduction the right column , acceptance is what i am working on today the interesting aspect of acceptance of a progressive condition is that once you have accepted your current state , it changes wikipedia defines acceptance as a person 's agreement to experience a situation , to follow a process or condition often a negative or uncomfortable situation without attempting to change it , protest , or exit religions and psychological treatments often suggest the path of acceptance when a situation is both disliked and unchangeable , or when change may be possible only at great cost or risk i especially have trouble with the without protest part as i also mention , living with kennedy s disease is a journey a long arduous one of self discovery since nothing comes into experience uninvited , i must be open receptive to both the good and the bad that accompanies these life experiences changes my current challenge is with my left thumb and index finger they are weakening rapidly the situation has degraded to a point where i no longer trust picking up or holding objects using those two digits washing dishes has become very difficult because i cannot reliably hold a soapy glass or dish while i scrub like anyone living with kennedy s disease , i continue to adapt to the most current loss of capabilities drinking glasses that are smaller in circumference or have handles seem to help balancing the object i e , a plate on my palm when carrying it also helps change adapt even though i have figured out a bunch of these work arounds , there are still some i am struggling with for example , buttoning or unbuttoning a shirt and its cuffs and , my jeans require some strength and dexterity with those two digits carving a chicken or turkey often requires the grabbing of a part i e , leg or wing in one hand while cutting it with the other flossing teeth getting to the back ones anyway require two hands touch typing works best with ten digits functioning normally i know i will eventually figure these work arounds out or just end up asking for help yet , that does not help the frustrations that come with another loss of capability and , since i am not normally considered a patient man , acceptance of a new loss can never come fast enough for me learning to live with kennedy s disease is a long and winding road with many obstacles and opportunities acceptance is what i am working on today for without it , i will never be able to take the next step on my journey
