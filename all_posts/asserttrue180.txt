you can buy hydroxytryptophan over the counter for mood amelioration , but beware of serotonin syndrome when mainline antidepressants do n't work as they often do n't people sometimes turn to nutritional supplements the most obvious one to turn to , in the case of depression , is tryptophan , because it 's a precursor of serotonin to save you a bit of reading , i 'll give the bottom line here , but be warned before you start popping tryptophan pills like candy , there 's a lot to know about tryptophan metabolism and possible risks if you 're taking any kind of medication , particularly ssris , you 'll want to consult your doctor and do a lot of homework yourself before wantonly gobbling tryptophan or htp pills having said all that , it turns out there 's reason to believe tryptophan might conceivably be helpful for depression biological endpoints of interest in tryptophan metabolism include proteins , melatonin , hydroxyindoleacetic acid hiaa , kynurenine , and niacin vitamin b note that this is a highly simplified diagram most of the arrows actually conceal multiple enzymatic steps see text for discussion first some background tryptophan is one of the out of , if you count selenocysteine proteinogenic amino acids that you must consume daily because your body ca n't manufacture it most of the tryptophan you eat will end up going to protein synthesis , but a sizable portion will also be converted to serotonin mostly in your gut , not your brain , and a comparatively small amount will end up being converted to melatonin in your pineal gland there 's a so called back door pathway to niacin , as well , but the yield on this pathway is so low that merely eating enough tryptophan wo n't keep you from eventually getting pellegra if you do n't also ingest sufficient quantities of niacin b note to advanced readers the kynurenine family of tryptophan metabolites has many interesting neurological properties if you favor as some do an inflammatory theory of pathogenesis in schizophrenia and major depression , you 'll want to read the excellent paper by m ller in dialogs in clinical neuroscience the impact of neuroimmune dysregulation on neuroprotection and neurotoxicity in psychiatric disorders relation to drug treatment which highlights the role of immunological dysregulation of kynurenines it 's possible , incidentally , to buy serotonin in pure form , but eating it wo n't do your brain any good , because serotonin does n't cross the blood brain barrier if it did , you could just eat bananas all day they 're rich in serotonin amino acids , on the other hand , do cross the bbb that 's where tryptophan comes into play but will ingesting tryptophan actually raise serotonin levels in one 's brain ? and if so , will that help with depression ? let 's take the second question first regular readers of this blog know that i 've trashed the serotonin imbalance theory of depression previously serotonin insufficiency simply is n't an adequate explanation of depression , based on the evidence that 's not to say ssris and snris do n't help many patients or that the drugs do nothing inside your brain far from it it 's clear , though , that there 's more going on in depression than mere serotonin imbalance see this recent report for a possible clue as to what else may be going on cache that thought it 's been known for over years that you can mess with people 's serotonin levels by altering their diet in fact , acute tryptophan deprivation atd is a well accepted technique in the study of depression , in part because experiments in rodents seem to verify the ability of a tryptophan knock out diet to cause a transient plunge in brain serotonin levels see gessa , g l , biggio , g , fadda , f , corsini , g u , tagliamonte , a effect of the oral administration of tryptophan free amino acid mixtures on serum tryptophan , brain tryptophan and serotonin metabolism , j neurochem , also see this open access paper from one result that has held up under replication is that when you challenge ssri medicated depression patients with a tryptophan knock out diet causing a sudden plunge in blood tryptophan , they go from remission to relapse at a higher than expected rate fortunately , they go right back to remission within hours or days of the experiment tryptophan deprivation 's effects are short lived and that 's another thing to bear in mind as we go along supplementary tryptophan is short lived , in the body however , when you challenge a group of non depressed volunteers in the same way , they do not show any mood alterations see this paper serotonin depletion does nothing to healthy volunteers reasoning backward , we might ask if tryptophan loading has the inverse effect , causing serotonin levels to increase and symptoms of depression to ease as it turns out , there 's reason to believe you can , indeed , force a boost in brain serotonin by tryptophan loading there are risks , too , though read on first we might ask why the tryptophan deprivation experiments work at all i 'll summarize a fairly large mount of work quickly tryptophan blood levels can be bounced high and low fairly easily to the tune of about a difference what counts is how much tryptophan gets across the blood brain barrier a carrier protein is responsible for escorting tryptophan across the bbb , but that protein is the same one that also escorts a number of other amino acids tyrosine , phenylalanine , valine , leucine , isoleucine across the bbb tryptophan has to compete with the other amino acids for this transporter protein , and experiments have shown it can compete more effectively if the blood ratio of tryptophan to tyrosine , phenylalanine , etc is high once tryptophan has made it across the bbb , it gets converted to hydroxytryptophane htp and then to serotonin the rate limiting step is conversion to htp while getting more serotonin production going is not simply a matter of getting more tryptophan across the bbb there are other enzyme systems , some with complex regulatory patterns , to consider , creation of htp is definitely essential to the production of serotonin it turns out you can buy htp over the counter , and yes , htp does cross the bbb why not just take supplemental htp ? actually , it 's something to consider many studies some of which we 'll get to in a minute have focused on administration of htp itself rather than tryptophan , since htp ca n't be siphoned away to protein synthesis but precisely because it ca n't be diverted to other uses , htp is about ten times more potent in its serotonergic effects than tryptophan it 's also an order of magnitude more toxic than tryptophan and many times more likely to cause serotonin syndrome if taken in conjunction with an adversely interactive drug e g , any ssri the oral ld for htp in rodents ranges from mg kg to mg kg the ld for tryptophan oral , rodent is more like grams kg you can safely swallow much more tryptophan than htp the research on htp for depression goes back more than years and is summarized in this review the studies tend to be marred by low sample size , short duration , lack of blinding , and other issues about the best that can be said is , if you want to find papers showing htp is highly effective for depression , you can find them you can also find studies that say lobotomy works that does n't mean you should believe them in the final analysis , what matters is whatever works for you with tryptophan and htp , it may pay to do your own experimentation but be cautious , especially with htp , which is intrinsically more toxic than tryptophan and more apt to trigger serotonin syndrome in susceptible individuals for or so , you can buy a month 's worth of these supplements and find out for yourself if they 're effective you wo n't know until you try have you added your name to the mailing list ? why not ? i want to thank the following individuals for retweeting me yesterday may you all live long and prosper follow these guys they retweet ! and by the way , if you have n't already checked out my book mental health myths debunked , you can grab a free copy right now at noisetrade com please go there and download it in epub or pdf it demolishes a ton of myths like depression is caused by a biochemical imbalance , in an entertaining way , with plenty of pointers to the scientific literature and some nice illustrations , too this book also has a few surprises in it , including a final chapter that 's if i do say so myself quite shocking , no pun intended the final chapter is on electroconvulsive therapy and the hideous safety record associated with it cozy up with this little book and give a copy to a friend you have my permission to duplicate the pdf see you on twitter !
