quest a search or pursuit made in order to find or obtain something several times over the last couple of years i have written about my journey of self discovery my quest actually began in the s i felt a void and began asking myself , who am i ? what is my purpose in life ? at the time i was into maslow s theory concerning man s hierarchy of needs i have written about maslow in an earlier post in brief , he believed that man in the broad sense humankind was a seeker that there was a natural instinctual nagging inside of all of us that nagging tells us there has to be more the concept follows that before a person could consider any higher needs , he she had to feel comfortable with the current situation to me , living with kennedy s disease is something we have to feel comfortable with before we can move on it becomes a major part of our acceptance process in september , s article i explained why i started this blog i feel the process of 'accepting' living with and not fighting kennedy 's disease is not just something that happens it is a learning process acceptance does not bring happiness or comfort instead , 'acceptance' means you are now able to acknowledge , understand , and deal with the reality of the situation with acceptance , life can once again begin to move forward i went on to say , if i shortened this post to one sentence , it would be , i believe that part of my process of learning to live with accept kennedy 's disease is to help others going down the same path maslow also indicated that man is inherently lazy my term once he she had achieved a certain fulfillment of needs , he she felt comfortable in wallowing around in enjoying this new world i am a wallow r throughout my adult life i would reach a point where i was quite comfortable and took the time to enjoy it and , like the theory explains , at some point i find it is just not enough and i again ask , who am i and is this all there is ? it usually takes a kick in the butt to make a person realize that there has to be more my most recent and constant kick is kennedy s disease every time i become accepting of my current condition , it changes strength declines i feel this decline is another reminder wake up call that my focus has been on the physical and psychological aspects of my life i e , living with kennedy s disease and has drifted away from my real quest of self discovery i have to once again accept that my world current reality is a result of my thoughts and beliefs my only limitations are those that are self imposed doubts , fears , perceptions , etc the stepping stone that i am currently standing on has become too comfortable i have hesitated and not tried to take the next step i am realizing that my focus has been on the acceptance process for too long and not on what is next i need to take that next step in other words , it is soul searching time again these stepping stones are my life s path i mention them in my header article top right of this page , we all have to learn to live with kennedy s disease
