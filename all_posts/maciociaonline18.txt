thyroid huang yao zi rhizoma dioscoreae bulbiferae , zhe bei mu bulbus fritillariae thunbergii , xia ku cao spica prunellae vulgaris examples of herbal prescriptions in order to give examples of herbal prescriptions for patients with cancer , we must distinguish three situations a patient with cancer before chemo radio therapy b patient during chemo or radio therapy c patient after surgery and radio chemo therapy a patient with cancer before chemo radio therapy when treating a patient with cancer before they had western treatment the first thing to do is to diagnose the chinese disease bian bing and the second is identify the patterns bian zheng we need to diagnose the chinese disease because it gives us an idea of prognosis , pathology and treatment i have given a list of chinese diseases with corresponding type of cancer in the previous blog post for example , carcinoma of the thyroid may be compared to shi ying , a type of goiter if we read about shi ying , we can learn something about the pathology and treatment of this condition of course , this is important to do but it is not enough because the chinese disease of shi ying would not entail the concept of malignancy secondly , we need to identify the patterns involved we cannot formulate a treatment for cancer if we do not identify the patterns these are also closely linked to the chinese disease for example , in the case of shi ying , there is always phlegm and blood stasis which makes the goiter feel hard on palpation the next essential step is to diagnose whether the patient 's condition is primarily full or empty this guides us to the choice of prescription , i e expelling pathogenic factors in full conditions or tonifying the body 's qi in empty conditions as i explained in the previous post , i generally primarily tonify the body 's qi in the beginning stages and primarily expel pathogenic factors in the middle late stages the emphasis is on the word primarily because any prescription i use would simultaneously tonify the body 's qi and expel pathogenic factors albeit in different degrees thus , a prescription to expel pathogenic factors would have at least one or two tonics and a prescription to tonify the body 's qi would have some herbs to resolve phlegm and invigorate blood , choosing preferably from the herbs that also have an anti cancer effect from the point of view of modern research finally , when choosing herbs , we should keep into account the pattern they treat but also modern research for example , if we need a qi yang tonic , we would prefer ren shen or huang qi over lu rong because the former two herbs have an anti cancer effect and lu rong does not another example could be that of herbs for toxic heat if we need a herb that resolves toxic heat , shan dou gen radix sophorae tochinchinensis would be preferable to qian li guang herba senecionis scandens therefore i would summarize the steps necessary for the choice of a herbal prescription are as follows identify the chinese disease identify the pattern decide whether the condition is primarily full in which case we primarily expel pathogenic factors or primarily empty in which case we primarily tonify the body 's qi choose a formula that suits the pattern add some tonics if we are expelling pathogenic factors or some herbs to resolve phlegm , invigorate blood and clear toxic heat if we are tonifying the body 's qi modify it with the addition of herbs that have an anti cancer effect the following is an example of a prescription for a patient with breast cancer she is a year old woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer years previously she had several hard lumps and the skin over the lumps was reddish purple her tongue was swollen with a sticky coating with red points in the chest breast area her pulse was fine but wiry on the left and fine weak on the right the clinical signs and tongue give a very clear indication of phlegm , blood stasis and toxic heat phlegm swollen tongue with sticky coating , breast lumps blood stasis hard lumps toxic heat reddish purple skin on breast , red points breast area on tongue the pulse reflects the combination of pathogenic factors being wiry and deficiency being fine and weak on the right there is no doubt in my mind that the condition is primarily full and that we therefore need to expel pathogenic factors i chose the formula ru he nei xiao tang breast nodule inner dissolving decoction that moves qi , invigorates blood and resolves toxic heat i modified it as follows qing pi pericarpium citri reticulatae viride in original formula xiang fu rhizoma cyperi in original formula yu jin radix curcumae in original formula san leng rhizoma sparganium dang gui radix angelicae sinensis in original formula bai shao radix paeoniae alba chi shao in original formula shan ci gu pseudobulbus cremastrae in original formula xia ku cao spica prunellae in original formula lou lu radix rhapontici in original formula si gua luo retinervus luffae fructus in original formula gua lou pi pericarpium trichosanthis bai hua she she cao herba hedyotis diffusae ban xia rhizoma pinelliae preparata huang qi radix astragali membranacei gan cao radix glycyrrhizae in original formula lu lu tong fructus liquidambaris taiwaniani the formula is well suited to this patient as it moves qi , invigorates and breaks blood and resolves toxic heat i added san leng to break blood changed chi shao to bai shao to nourish blood pulse weak and fine on the right added gua lou pi and ban xia to resolve phlegm added huang qi to strengthen the immune system added lu lu tong to direct the formula to the breast lu lu tong is one of few herbs which are said to penetrate the breast luo channels tong ru luo these herbs can be used as messenger herbs to reach the breast but they also remove obstructions from the breast additionally , lu lu tong is indicated here because it also invigorates blood b patients with cancer during chemo radio therapy the treatment of cancer patients who are undergoing chemo therapy and or radio therapy is entirely different during chemo or radio therapy we do not treat the patterns underlying the cancer but concentrate on supporting the immune system and minimizing the side effects of treatment the treatment principle during chemotherapy is to tonify qi , nourish yin , cool blood , resolve dampness and clear heat the treatment principle during radiotherapy is to nourish blood , cool blood , nourish yin and invigorate blood unfortunately , there is a widespread view among oncologists that patients who are undergoing chemotherapy should not take antioxidants the reason for this would be that chemotherapy oxidates cancer cells to destroy them and therefore anything that is anti oxidant would stop chemotherapy from working i disagree with this view and , in any case , chinese herbs do not contain antioxidants c patients after surgery and radio chemo therapy when treating patients after surgery and radio or chemotherapy , we need to assess them from a chinese medicine perspective we need to evaluate whether the patterns that caused cancer in the first place are still there i base this assessment primarily on the tongue and pulse the three main patterns in cancer are blood stasis , phlegm and toxic heat and if the tongue and pulse show signs of these , i consider the cancer still active even if it has been eradicated by surgery and treated by radiotherapy and or chemotherapy therefore if the tongue is purple blood stasis and swollen phlegm and the pulse full , i treat the patient as if the cancer were still there the tongue on the top is purple blood stasis and swollen phlegm when evaluating whether there is blood stasis , we should also look at the sublingual veins the tongue on the bottom shows dark and swollen veins which indicates blood stasis a purple colour is not the only dangerous sign if the tongue is red with many red points , it indicates toxic heat toxic heat always indicates a poor prognosis because it means the cancer may spread all the more so if the pulse is rapid red points as for the pulse , a pulse of the full type wiry , slippery , firm indicates that the pathogenic factors that caused cancer are still active a pulse of the empty type weak , fine indicates that the condition is primarily empty therefore , if tongue and pulse show that the pathogenic factors are still active , i give a prescription that primarily eliminates pathogenic factors i say primarily because i would always add some tonic herbs that support the immune system in addition to that , i would also use some herbs with an anti cancer effects indicated above if the tongue and pulse show that the pathogenic factors are not active and that there is a pronounced deficiency , i then prescribe a formula that primarily tonifies qi , yang , blood or yin again , i say primarily because the formula would also include herbs to expel pathogenic factors and herbs with anti cancer effect the following is an example of a prescription for a patient after treatment with surgery and chemotherapy and with which i primarily expelled pathogenic factors a year old female patient had ovarian cancer years previously she had a hysterectomy and oophorectomy followed by chemotherapy a few months before the consultation they discovered some lumps in the abdomen for which she had more chemotherapy her tongue was reddish purple and her pulse was wiry and full in general and weak on both kidney positions i diagnosed severe blood stasis on the basis of the tongue and pulse with an underlying kidney deficiency based on the tongue and pulse and the recurrence of lumps , i decided that the treatment should be aimed primarily at expelling pathogenic factors , in her case at invigorating blood i used the following prescription dang gui radix angelicae sinensis invigorate blood chi shao radix paeoniae rubra invigorate blood yi mu cao herba leonuri heterophylli invigorate blood chuan niu xi radix cyathulae officinalis invigorate blood e zhu rhizoma curcumae ezhu break blood san leng rhizoma sparganii stoloniferi break blood bai hua she she cao herba hedyotis diffusae anti cancer ban zhi lian herba scutellariae barbatae anti cancer huang qi radix astragali membranacei tonify qi , support immune system tu si zi semen cuscutae chinensis tonify kidney yang the following is an example of a prescription for a patient after treatment with surgery and chemotherapy and with which i primarily tonified zheng qi this year old patient had had ovarian cancer years previously she had a hysterectomy and oophorectomy followed by chemotherapy four years after that , she was diagnosed with bowel cancer for which she had surgery followed by chemotherapy one year after that , she had breast cancer for which she had surgery and radiotherapy this case history is unfortunately an example of a radical western treatment with surgery and chemo or radiotherapy and yet the pathogenic factors were obviously still active as the ovarian cancer was followed by bowel cancer and breast cancer her tongue was pale , slightly swollen with a sticky coating her pulse was weak on both kidney positions as the tongue is pale and the kidney positions weak , she obviously suffered from a kidney yang and spleen yang deficiency however , the slight swelling of the tongue shows phlegm based on the tongue and pulse , i decided that my primary aim should be to tonify spleen and kidney yang and only secondarily to resolve phlegm i used the following prescription huang qi radix astragali membranacei tonify qi , support immune system bai zhu rhizoma atractylodis tonify qi , support immune system , tonify spleen yang fu ling poria resolve phlegm chen pi pericarpium citri reticulati resolve phlegm tu si zi semen cuscutae chinensis tonify kidney yang xu duan raadix dipsaci asperi tonify kidney yang ban xia rhizoma pinelliae preparatum resolve phlegm bai hua she she cao herba hedyotis diffusae anti cancer i also prescribed the mushroom coriolus prognosis when i see a patient who has had cancer and been treated with surgery and radio chemotherapy i formulate a prognosis on the basis chinese diagnosis based most of all on tongue and pulse poor prognosis tongue purple or red with red points , swollen pulse full wiry , slippery , firm , overflowing the prognosis is particularly unfavourable if the pulse is also rapid good prognosis tongue normal or pale , not swollen pulse weak in general in case of breast cancer , one should pay particular attention to the breast area on the tongue which was discussed in a previous post https www blogger com blogger g ? blogid editor target
