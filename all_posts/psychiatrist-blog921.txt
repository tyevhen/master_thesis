dinah has monday off but this is the weekend , and the weekend is the time to get things done it 's time to tackle the list i have lists for everything grocery shopping , personal errands , work from home assignments , travel all types climbing vacations , hiking , biking , beach and conference , even hobby activities i know i'm not alone dinah has a mental to do list , and even keeps them for her friends ask me how i know ! the advantage of listkeeping is that you are less likely to forget something , which means that you avoid embarrassment and people getting annoyed with you a good list keeps anxiety at bay when you 're swamped with responsibilities and keeps you focussed on the next task at hand instead of running around like a scattered person you can work more efficiently when you can organize errands according to location or time of day there are a few bad things too a certain amount of anxiety is necessary to actually get started on a task with a list , you 're temped to think , i 've got that covered it 's on the list , but then you never actually do it when the list gets too short that actually does happen sometimes ! i get caught up then the list disappears and duties get lost the other problem is that task begets task you cross off one task , but that leads to another you make the phone call , but the conversation leads to a new task the list becomes an unending series of responsibility , which is rather demoralizing task management is a psychological issue some people never make a list and live 'on the fly' , some people make lists occasionally , a few rare people start the day by running the list what 's your style ? and no dinah , you ca n't have access to my list i put enough stuff on there myself
