explanation taken from problogger what is rss ? do you want to keep up to date with the latest posts on the reality of anxiety ? i have a number of ways that you can subscribe to this site and receive updates the main one that my readers use is my rss feed rss is a technology that is being used by millions of web users around the world to keep track of their favorite websites in the old days of the web to keep track of updates on a website you had to bookmark websites in your browser and manually return to them on a regular basis to see what had been added the problems with bookmarking you as the web surfer had to do all the work it can get complicated when you are trying to track many websites at once you miss information when you forget to check your bookmarks you end up seeing the same information over and over again on sites that don t update very often rss changes everything what if you could tell a website to let you know every time that they update ? in a sense , this is what rss does for you rss flips things around a little and is a technology that provides you with a method of getting relevant and up to date information sent to you for you to read in your own time it saves you time and helps you to get the information you want quickly after it was published rss stands for really simple syndication many people describe it as a news feed that you subscribe to it s like subscribing to a magazine that is delivered to you periodically but instead of it coming in your physical mail box each month when the magazine is published it is delivered to your rss reader every time your favorite website updates how rss actually technically works is probably a lesson for another day but the key today is for you to understand why it s good and how to use it let me say right up front that i m not the most technically savvy person but even i can use rss at first i found it a little strange to make the change from bookmarking to rss but i found that when i started that i just couldn t stop how to use rss get an rss reader the first thing you ll want to do if you re getting into reading sites via rss is to hook yourself up with an rss feed reader there are many feed readers going around with a variety of approaches and features however a good place to start is with a couple of free and easy to use web based ones like google reader and bloglines either one will do if you re starting out i use google s homepage reader as i say there are many others to choose from but to get started either of these are fairly easy to use and will help you work out the basics of rss both of these feed readers work a little like email as you subscribe to feeds you ll see that unread entries from the sites you re tracking will be marked as bold as you click on them you ll see the latest update and can read it right there in the feed reader you are given the option to click through to the actual site or move onto the next unread item marking the last one as read the best way to learn how to use either google reader or bloglines is to simply subscribe to some feeds and give it a go both have helpful help sections to get you up and running note other options to tracking websites that you might already be familiar with include using pages like myyahoo , mygoogle and mymsn find some feeds to subscribe to there are two places to look for a site s feed on the site in your browser on site subscription over the last few years you may have noticed a lot of little buttons and widgets appearing on your favorite sites and blogs little orange buttons , counters with how many readers a blog has , links called rss , xml , atom and many more they come in all shapes and sizes here are a few you might have seen there are plenty more but any time you see any of these buttons or anything like them it means that the site you are viewing almost certainly has a feed that you can subscribe to in most cases it s as simple as either copying and pasting the link associated with the button into your rss reader or clicking the button and following the instructions to subscribe using the feed reader of your choice browser subscription many internet browsers now have the ability to find and subscribe to rss feeds built right into them when you surf to a site you can usually tell if it has an rss feed by looking in the right hand side of address bar where you type in the site s url you will see a little orange box like the picture at the top of this post , or little rss letters , or a similar icon click that and you ll be locating the reality of anxiety s rss feed other modern browsers will have similar icons to quickly and easily subscribe by clicking these icons you ll want to set up your browser to do it with your feed reader of choice as by default they will probably subscribe you using the in browser reader you can do this by going to the preferences to your browser and choosing google reader or bloglines etc as your feed reader once you ve done this and have subscribed to a few feeds you ll begin to see unread items in your feed reader and you can start reading don t want to use an rss reader ?
