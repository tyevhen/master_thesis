the mood change i effected the other day is truly remarkable not only for it longevity i'm still very up today without any further effort buut for its intensity i'm so joyful i 'd be manic if i did n't know better but also it shows how simple it is to link almost anything , your mood , a project , a chore , with a bunch of positive emotional tags that already exist in your memory bank i wo n't say it 's easy because when you do n't feel all that up you do n't feel like doing anything about it either it 's always an effort to get out of a down mood the mood change the other day also shows how infantile the emotional subcortex really is i still ca n't believe how excited my emotional subcortex now gets over that darn laundry room i have cleaned a good part of it and what continues to amaze me is how fun all of a sudden that dumb laundry room is after being a drag on me for months i look forward my subcortex looks forward to my next visit i can hardly get by the room without putting one more thing away i did n't know i had a potential disney world housing my washer and dryer that 's what my subcortex thinks anyway this whole thing has been a much more powerful lesson than i realized when i first started out just to get out of a kind of nothing much going on neutral mood because i really like an upbeat , energetic one a b curtiss
