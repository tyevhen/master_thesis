the new agers , or what i call the booga booga followers make a big deal of self love so what is wrong with it ? i have said before that it is an oxymoron oxytocin is what i call the hormone of love if you rub an animal s belly , levels rise if you lick her , oxytocin also rises , but if you rub yourself it won t you cannot love yourself there is more what does it mean to love yourself ? what it doesn t mean is to be able to feel love in the present , no matter what because once you are unloved throughout your childhood it is imprinted you are unloved and feel unloved even when you don t know it it drives all later behavior either to try to get it depending on the birth , whether parasympathetic giving up , or sympathetic keep struggling you give up when the birth is basically struggle and fail and you keep on trying when the birth was struggle and success i have written about this in my books and blog it pretty determines personality , but for now , it is another matter while i am discussing oxytocin i should mention a recent study where they sprayed the chemical into the noses of human subjects they had a control group they were all alcohol addicted those who were sprayed had fewer cravings for alcohol , afterwards they had milder withdrawal symptoms the control group got placebos the sprayed were less addicted later so what does this mean ? since oxytocin is the hormone of love , inter alia , it means that love stops the craving of course and when you are loved at the start of life there will not be any craving or addiction later on permenantly all else being equal i have written in the blog about the nature of love and how you can love a fetus you fulfill its needs when you understand them ok now you feel deeply unloved because you were how do you go from there to loving yourself ? i mean , it is good to take care of yourself , stop acting out that you deserve nothing , stop being self destructive all that helps but hug and kiss yourself ? a little pat on the head when you were five ? but with the imprint the unconscious will still drive all that bad behavior no matter what of course there are stop gaps and we should all do what we do to feel better , but none of that , none of that , will help us feel loved why ? because we were indeed unloved and it is registered and re registered throughout our childhood we feel unloved and nothing will cover that over because it is now engraved into the system we are unloved in the brain , the blood and the muscles we are unloved in the cells all of those register trauma lack of love is trauma in their own way it helps a lot to know that you are attracted to those cold fish who cannot love so that you can struggle to get love out of them but need wins out yes , conscious awareness helps , but it fights a losing battle cognitive therapy , focused in the present , which is what the left brain does , can help us understand the kind of situations or people to avoid but they cannot begin to touch the drive that makes it happen they , and therefore the patient , never understands the unconscious and never gets well that includes the therapist who helps the patient skim along the top , never asking why ? a little word with a big meaning that is avoided in that therapy they claim that they don t need to know why yes they do it is the difference between help and cure if you want help you don t need to know why but the unconscious will never cease to drive you even when you are not aware of being driven it is the function of the unconscious that you remain unconscious so you shouldn t know , otherwise , you would be in pain all day long and your face would show it we would all walk down the street grimacing and frowning and hunched what a world that is truly the world of our unconscious thank god if i may call on it for a moment for the disconnect repression saves and repression kills it creates and destroys it is optimistic because it doesn t understand the true situation and that optimism kills us because it denies the pain and keeps it alive and active , gnawing away within the system it is unrelenting which makes our behavior unrelenting and unforgiving we become obsessive because of it we are forced into wrong choices by the unconscious and it is unwavering in its neurosis why ? it seeks out the early situation again for us to try to master it so we seek out the critical ones when we had critical mothers , and we seek out cold men when we had a cold father we need to start again to try to make them approving and loving we need the struggle why can t we go straight for love ? because the imprint is supreme and it stays unconscious we go for the unlove first it is all we know if we feel unloved and that we don t deserve love , we do not go for it and believe me when we were not loved we nearly always feel that it is our fault and that we do not deserve it
