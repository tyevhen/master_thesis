i do n't know if i can do this again , but of course i will it 's am in minutes i have to load up puck and leave for the vet clinic it may seem like no big deal , especially if you are not a pet owner , but puck is my child equivalent it is a big , big deal my heart has already sunk , too heavy to remain suspended in its usual locale i feel so guilty for throwing that damn ball i feel so sorry for the pain he is in and the severe pain he is about to endure i ca n't explain to him what 's going on i ca n't tell puck what to expect i ca n't remind him he 's been through this before and assure him everything will be okay he did n't understand why i would n't feed him this morning he stood at his dish , on his three good legs , staring up expectantly with his innocent brown eyes he 's not going to understand when i leave him at the vet clinic with tears in my eyes it 's frustrating , and i'm already stressed i woke up several times during the night just to listen was he asleep ? was he comfortable ? did he need help repositioning ? the rapid fire click , click , click of his toenails against the hardwood assured me he was at least chasing pesky squirrels in his dreams i wrote the above before leaving this morning it 's evening now , and puck made it through surgery i did n't watch the procedure this time the vet reported his knee looked perfect except for the totally ruptured acl that 's better than his other knee where we found a torn lateral meniscus , too hopefully , this means quicker and more complete healing of this one he still lacks some flexion on the other side , likely as a result of the torn meniscus i miss my boy right now my house is so quiet without him here he 'll stay overnight at the clinic i ca n't wait to pick him up tomorrow , and yet , unlike puck , i know the stress that 's ahead i think i'm going to be doing a lot of praying over the next few weeks in fact , i'm on my way to an aa meeting right now think good thoughts for me and my boy , please !
