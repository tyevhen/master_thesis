i 've seen tech recruitment from both sides of the desk i have been a job applicant , and i have been a hiring manager neither role is pretty one of the unprettier sides of the hiring process in r d is the on site interview stage , when the hiring manager or one of his peers gets to ask the applicant highly technical domain knowledge questions this can be done skillfully or poorly it gets ugly fast when it becomes a hazing ritual based on riddle solving the correct answer to riddle questions it 's one thing to ask an open ended technical question that lends itself to straightforward answers e g , what are some things you could do to minimize the time spent in garbage collection ? it 's quite another to subject the interviewee to game show riddles four people want to cross a bridge they all begin on the same side you have twelve minutes to get all of them across to the other side it is night there is one flashlight a maximum of two people can cross at one time , etc my advice to job hunters do n't hire the employer who subjects you to such assholery when i say do n't hire the employer , i'm referring to the fact that a job interview is a two way process the employer is interviewing the prospective employee , but the prospective employee is also interviewing the employer each is hiring the other both actors should be asking questions reasonable questions both should be engaged in meaningful conversation meaningless riddles are out of band reject a riddle by asking if you can have a more concrete , job related question ask if there 's perhaps a difficult problem currently receiving attention in the department you 'd be working in ask if you can take a crack at that problem , or something just like it if you 're lucky and if the interviewer is anywhere near as smart as he or she thinks he she is , the interviewer will pick up on the fact that you 're a serious , pragmatic individual with domain expertise and intelligence , who is anxious to apply hard won knowledge to real world problems you 're not a game show contestant a really stubborn , inflexible interviewer will stick to the riddle strategy and defend it by saying something like i do n't really care if you get the question right , i just want to see how you think which is completely ludicrous a candidate who immediately produces the right answer to a riddle will always impress this kind of interviewer far more than someone who does n't that 's the whole point of riddles if a person really wanted to see how you think , would n't he or she want to get to know you a little bit , perhaps draw you out with a series of simple questions ? would n't it mean engaging you in two way conversation about something meaningful ? ask yourself do you want to work for the kind of manager or company that sees its new hires as successful game show contestants ? the right thing to do if you 're an interviewer who wants to see how a candidate thinks or reasons or problem solves is to ask open ended questions that are both job related , and call for domain expertise if you 're hiring a java programmer , by all means ask an open ended question like what would you do if an application is failing because of outofmemoryerrors ? this could lead to discussions and further questions around a whole host of issues relating to checked and unchecked exceptions , memory leaks , garbage collection , design patterns , good coding practices , debugging strategies , etc within a few minutes , you should know a lot more about the applicant 's qualifications than whether or not he or she bought this year 's most asked job interview riddles book before coming to the interview let 's be clear there 's absolutely no need , ever , to subject an interviewee to questions for which there 's a trick answer the hiring process is n't about tricks and games , is it ? if you 're a job candidate and you feel an interview is going in an inappropriate direction , it 's up to you to speak out do n't forget , you 're doing some interviewing here , too ask politely if you can have another question if the interviewer sticks with riddles and says i just want to see how you think , you 're dealing with a certain kind of person colloquially known as a braying jackass , so dumb it down and politely ask the interviewer if you can have another question , job related , that will allow you to demonstrate how you think you may even have to suggest possible questions yourself , if the interviewer is a bit thick hire an employer who values the real you , not the game show you unless , of course , you 're into humiliation and who 's the alpha dog bullshit , in which case , may you find happiness and fulfillment together
