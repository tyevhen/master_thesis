i 've been having a lot of fun lately putting together this new line of chic original art they are small abstract squares some are x inches and some are x of high end watercolor paper painted with holbein acryla gouache ultra fine paints that act like a really rich opaque watercolor i love putting happy colors together to see how they harmonize and the results are so pretty and impactful ! i love the surprise as each painting unfolds to life to increase the style and glam factor , i added bits of gold leaf or silver leaf where applicable to the design i think it adds a delicate gleam that makes the pieces much more special these are all one of a kind and totally affordable ! i'm selling these original small abstracts for each , unframed it saves my collectors money to be able to choose their own frame and not pay for my markup it also saves in shipping costs these are small , but the frame makes all the difference ! also , you can put more than one together and fill an empty wall quite nicely ! i only have for sale now , but plan on making a ton more so that collectors can choose several in one colorway at once i'm also taking custom orders for these if you want your own special color combination ! i also think i'm going to offer a line of these at a larger x inch size for a higher cost i can really see these adding a special punch to a chic nursery or to a stylish glam teen 's bedroom i'm definitely making several for myself for my own master bedroom and bathroom i want something that is n't everywhere else , you know ? something pretty and soothing anyway , i wanted to share my excitement with you and i 'll let you know when more paintings are listed in my shop i hope you like them too ! ! ! i welcome your feedback in the comments ! save
