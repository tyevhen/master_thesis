all of us perceive the world based on our life experience and beliefs we have built over time these beliefs may come from a mixture of that experience and the belief systems of those with whom we live and then as we get older , those with whom we spend our time for example , i tend to look at the world through rose colored glasses and i tend to be relaxed and low key most of the time i can kick it in gear when necessary , such as work needing done , but do n't tend to stress i grew up with parents from the hills of the ozarks many would say they had very hillbilly like childhoods i hope so because to me , that carries a picture of very relaxed , simple people who enjoy the beauty of the world around them and each other our children had their early years surrounded by trauma , neglect , and or abuse to them the world is a dangerous place love is not to be trusted because people who love you hurt you love is not safe repeated trauma not only made this reality if it the very basis of their view of the world it is hardwired into there brains just as deeply as is my own view of the world as a safe and loving place yes there is danger but my shock and horror at crime and injustice comes from my belief that those things go so against my world view our children expect to fail they expect us to leave they believe moms are dangerous as they are not to be trusted and break your heart we just keep loving them and telling them they are safe , love is good , they are worth loving and then we demonstrate it daily we do n't feel it every day we do n't succeed every day but then we get up and start again we never , never quit
