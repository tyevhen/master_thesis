yesterday i talked about the connection between antidepressant usage and diabetes it may seem odd , at first , that antidepressants should double one 's risk of diabetes , but given the pervasive involvement of serotonin in appetite and digestive processes and the ability of antidepressants to make you fat see discussion below , perhaps it should n't really come as such a shock to put things in perspective around of the body 's serotonin can be found in the gastrointestinal tract only is in your brain reference serotonin is the primary signalling molecule involved in motility , secretion , and vasodilation within the intestines , and just as in the brain , bioavailability of serotonin to target cells in the gut is dependent on the serotonin reuptake transporter sert sert , in turn , is the binding target of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors when you take an ssri like prozac , zoloft , paxil , etc , you 're medicating your intestines and your nearby reproductive system , which is highly innervated and dependent on serotonin for proper functioning and also , your brain so it should surprise no one that the main physiologic effects of ssri administration are , in fact , on gut , sex organs , and brain if you were thinking you were mainly medicating your brain , with your sex organs and gut experiencing side effects , you 've essentially got it backwards serotonin 's main effect in your body is keeping your gastrointestinal system functioning it 's worth noting that low dose ssris have been used to treat irritable bowel syndrome , but it should also be noted that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding , particularly when used with nsaids for more on serotonin 's action in the gut , see this paper and also this paper i also recommend serotonin receptors and transporters roles in normal and abnormal gastrointestinal motility , in alimentary pharmacology therapeutics , volume , issue supplement s , pages , november full article here weight control is at least partially mediated through the htc serotonin receptor in the hypothalamus we know this is true because knockout mice with a targeted mutation of the htc receptor gene engage in chronic hyperphagia overeating , leading to obesity and hyperinsulemia reference we also know this because obese humans who 've been exposed to the potent htc receptor agonist m chlorophenylpiperazine mcpp experience weight loss and appetite changes there 's also very good evidence that polymorphisms in the promoter region of the htc receptor gene play a direct role in obesity and diabetes in humans these kinds of interactions led the authors of a report in nature medicine , to state categorically that a perturbation of brain serotonin systems can predispose to type diabetes finally , it 's worth pointing out that some ssris prozac in particular exhibit direct action on htc receptors and not just on sert so bottom line , there 's plenty of reason to believe that antidepressants can play a direct role in fostering diabetes and then there 's the small matter of weight gain most doctors tell their patients that weight gain is not a problem with ssris that it 's mainly a problem with older tricyclic drugs , but this is a myth drug trials of the kind that lead to fda approval of antidepressants are far too short in duration to bring out long term weight change trends , which is why weight gain is hardly ever mentioned in package inserts for ssris in the rare instance when weight gain is mentioned , it 's usually painted as restoration of appetite due to recovery from depression , which is self serving nonsense , imho in a study called real world data on ssri antidepressant side effects , published in psychiatry edgmont february , real world patients taking citalopram celexa , escitalopram lexapro , fluoxetine prozac , paroxetine paxil , and sertraline zoloft were asked about side effects among the patients who noted specific side effects , the three most common side effects , by far , were sexual dysfunction , sleepiness , and weight gain see graph below all three occurred at about the same rate , , and reports , respectively , out of total real world ssri users reported weight gain almost as often as sexual side effects from http www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc how much weight gain are we talking about ? very substantial weight gain long term studies have reported mean weight gains of lb kg for sertraline zoloft , lb kg for fluoxetine prozac , and lb kg for paroxetine paxil citalopram celexa is often painted as being less likely to cause weight gain than other antidepressants , and yet in one trial , of patients reported an average weight gain of lb kg after receiving citalopram for just weeks see this table for a rundown of weight gain effects for various popular antidepressants a norwegian study raeder mb , bjelland i , vollset se , steen vm , obesity , dyslipidemia , and diabetes with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors the horland health study , j clin psychiatry found we observed an association between use of ssris as a group n and abdominal obesity or , ci to and hypercholesterolemia or , ci to after adjusting for multiple possible confounders there was also a trend toward an association between ssri use and diabetes the norwegian study involved patients taking paroxetine , citalopram , sertraline , fluoxetine , and or fluvoxamine the bottom line weight gain is a serious issue with ssris not just older antidepressants , and the association of ssris with increased risk of diabetes is not a statistical fluke of some kind , but a very real outcome given what we know about serotonin 's role in appetite , weight control , and gastrointestinal function , none of this should come as a surprise
