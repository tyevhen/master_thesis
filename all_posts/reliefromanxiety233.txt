if you feel like you are suffering with a mental illness your first port of call should be your doctor gp they should be able to put you into the right direction , whether that be counselling , medication or any other health service your gp doctor your gp covers a wide range of topics when regarding mental illness , so i will try to make it simple if you are having problems in regards to your mental health , whether that be depression anxiety or any other mental illness , you can go to your gp do n't be hesitant to discuss it with your gp , i did and it really was my first step on the way to recovery i know it can be scary , especially if you get extremely anxious or embarrassed , but just think of the improvements you will make counselling therapy out of everything i will ever mention on this blog , counselling is the most important step this list below mentions some of the counselling services i know of and or have gone through a private sector this can be somewhat costly and can take a long time to search for a private counsellor or hypnotherapist however , if you are in desperate need , then this is what you should go for i was put on a waiting list for an nhs mental health service , which i was on for months because i was in such desperate need , i had to go private i saw a hypnotherapist where it was half talking about my feelings and how i was doing with certain aspects of my anxiety and the other half was relaxing and what is known as 'hypnotherapy' this is where your hypnotherapist will read specific things to try and make your brain relax clear feel a different way about a situation it 's really not as bad as you think b nhs mental health services through my own experience , this is by far a much more meaty type of counselling and really worked for me i think each area of the uk will offer different kinds of services , so you will have to do some research to find out in my first session i was assessed with anxiety and depression charters and my therapist decided based on my condition which method was right for me c camhs this is only available in certain areas of the uk , however it 's known to be a great and helpful service for people suffering with emotional and behavioral issues this is a service which again can help you , but i do not have any experience with there are many other services out there , but your gp will be the most informative with this topic medication medication is another option in helping with your health doctors seem to try therapy and other methods first before medication however , if you feel you are in desperate need of it because therapy is n't helping or you feel you need it in conjunction , then you should go to your doctors to discuss your situation there is a range of medication out there to deal with anxiety depression and not all of them will work for you you may need to try a few before it really works your doctor gp is the best person to talk to and will advise you about what to do recovery is also based upon you recovery is extremely hard and there is no denying it counselling therapy and other methods takes will power and can be very hard when you are in a situation like this , however time will pass and you will get there keep going , i know you can do it and i know it 's hard , but you 've got this good luck and best wishes , amy x
