i 've mentioned this here before when my house is a chaotic , i start to feel chaotic well , my house is chaotic right now outside of work , i'm spending so much time training , which , for me , means extra sleep time , too , that i 've been neglecting my home there is a lot of piling going on mail on the table , dishes in the sink , clothes in the hamper pile , pile , pile i do n't like when i let my house get like this it bothers me when my house gets too chaotic , but i really should n't complain after all , i 've allowed the chaos by choosing to expend my limited energy elsewhere chores have typically taken a back seat lately today i worked on cleaning up the table full of mail and paid some bills , but the dirty laundry has n't moved it 's still waiting for me but after running and swimming this morning , i needed my usual nap , and now i just do n't have the energy obviously , my priority is , and has been exercise , not chores i think it 's important to have priorities when dealing with any illness heck , it 's important to have priorities when dealing with life ! over the past nine years , i 've figured out what keeps me on my feet mentally and physically clean clothes , spotless dishes , and dusted surfaces do help my mood , but exercise and sleep help a lot more taking my meds , eating regularly , and spending time with sober friends probably all come in higher than chores , too those are the things that keep me sane hmmm reminding myself of these priorites helps me feel less chaotic already something tells me i 'll be able to put up with my dirty laundry for a few more days
