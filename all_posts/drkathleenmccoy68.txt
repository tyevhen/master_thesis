as i look back wistfully to that special week , it seems a very long time ago but it has been only a month and a half since we were there it was a long time dream , a trip two years in the planning we would go to hilo , hawaii to visit my dear friend jeanne nishida yagi and her husband jimmy yagi and , while there , we decided , just this once , to rent a home nearby it was a beautiful cabin on a ridge , in the middle of an island rainforest , with huge waterfalls at the back of the property i had seen the house years ago in architectural digest it was built as a vacation retreat by a gay architect from san francisco who died before having a chance to enjoy it a local businessman bought it and keeps it as a vacation rental and special event venue called the falls at reed 's island it is booked months , years in advance while we were there , the owner told us that he had just had to tell someone trying to reserve christmas week that is was already booked we saved considerable money by making our reservations two years ago and all the time since , we had been anticipating , dreaming of our stay there we could never have imagined , even looking at the beautiful pictures on the website , just how wonderful it would be the steady and comforting sounds of water the falls , the river , the rain throughout the house and the living sounds of the rainforest birds by day , singing frogs by night there were the mists and rainbows and lush tropical vegetation , flowers growing wild bob meditating in the back yard of the falls view from the kitchen window with the soothing sights and sounds , my thoughts settled into reverie i thought about the joy of new experiences being in a place so new , so different , so unfamiliar , yet comforting and the wonder of beauty all around us , so vivid , from every window every glimpse outside was a delight and a revelation i thought about how we so often take for granted and stop seeing the beauty most familiar to us so quickly and wondered what delights i might be overlooking at home i made a vow to reconnect with the unique beauty awaiting us at home the startling clarity of a desert sky at night , the smell of the desert after a monsoon rain , the colors of blooming palo verde in the spring and the sweet , unexpected smell of citrus blossoms in the air i thought with love and a bit of worry about our ailing cat gus how he would love the smells and sounds of the rainforest , how he blessed our lives every day , how i wanted to soothe and comfort him all the remaining days of his life , never realizing that we would have only a week together between our return and his death but there in the rainforest , i felt a loving connection to gus as i was surrounded by forces of nature and quietly accepted the fact that sooner rather than later , we would lose this beloved animal but treasure having known him forever i thought that , for all the beauty of this wondrous place , the greatest joy of this trip was spending time with my friend jeanne and her family i thought about the meaning of long friendships in our lives jeanne and i have been friends since our early days of college at that time , we were united in being geographically unusual she , a native of hilo , hawaii and i hailing from los angeles , were among the few warm weather natives traveling to northwestern 's campus north of chicago a year ahead of jeanne , i was matched with her as a big sister to ease her transition on campus we clicked and have been dear friends since we braved the great storm of ' together venturing out for ice cream with the conditions still near white out , spending a christmas together later that year in my graduate student apartment complete with christmas tree and cookies jeanne baked and a holiday dinner we cooked together there were letters and phone calls and visits in our early career years , particularly after jeanne returned to hawaii after working for the peace corps in saipan and washington , d c we battled weight gains and celebrated periods of svelteness and mourned the loss of several dear friends together she was at my side in when i married bob and i was delighted when she married jimmy in it was and is a marriage made in heaven she is an avid basketball fan , he a well regarded basketball coach with an international reputation his first wife carol , a dear friend of jeanne 's , died of cancer in the late seventies and jeanne and jimmy fell in love while sharing their grief and loving memories of carol they spent their honeymoon at a basketball camp in colorado this is a partnership that was meant to be we make a great team , jimmy said smiling fondly at his wife during our visit jeanne and jimmy yagi they have both had health challenges in the past year , but have come through with the support of a loving extended family and each other sunday brunch with jeanne center and family it was wonderful to see the love and humor and generosity of spirit abound even more beautiful , more soothing , than the sights and sounds of the rainforest we decided to make visits a new tradition please make this a tradition at least once a year , jeanne said quietly before we left and again in an email it does n't have to cost you any more than airfare stay with us next time use our second car the important thing , we agreed , was having time , more time together , time to talk , time to enjoy the friendship that first blossomed in our teens and that has thrived into our golden years waterfalls are gorgeous , but nothing is more glorious than joy and love in the eyes of a dear friend
