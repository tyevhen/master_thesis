today 's post is a cop out i'm stealing , verbatim , from the social q 's column in the ny times i 've somehow missed the social dear abby column , but today 's is shrinky , so why not ? social q s my shrink gasp ! has shrunk by philip galanes published january , after not seeing my therapist for several months , i returned to find her a wisp of her former self she was never fat before , but she looks like a marathon runner now it seems strange not to comment on such a significant change but even my most innocuous questions like how are you ? are either ignored or turned back on me should i be quiet , or can i mention the weight loss ? christoph niemann elizabeth , berkeley , calif and the social q person responded oh , how i envy you ! my therapist hasn t changed so much as his shoes in all the years that i ve been seeing him and there s only so much hay you can make with a scuffed up pair of bass weejuns so speak up successful therapy requires you to share your thoughts it may be the one office on earth where unedited candor is a good idea there will be consequences , though if you compliment her on her weight loss , you will spend the balance of your session dissecting your body image and if you sound a note of alarm for her health , the subject will turn to mortality either fear of yours , or how the prospect of hers triggers your abandonment issues so i think i practice another brand of psychiatry when patients comment on my appearance , i usually just mutter thank you or whatever might be my version of socially appropriate and move on i'm not sure i 've ever cured anyone by insisting they fully understand their motivations behind noticing that i 've lost weight , had my hair blow dryed to a different style , or am wearing a new outfit i'm not saying there is nothing to be gained from exploring these issues , i'm just not sure that it 's worth the trade off of taking the time away from talking about things going on in their lives
