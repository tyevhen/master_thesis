like everyone else , i remember where i was and what i was thinking as i watched the world trade center s north tower burning i kept on asking , was this a mistake some freak accident ? how could any plane fly into the tower ? an act of terrorism was the furthest thing from my mind at that moment then as my wife and i watched the second plane hit the south tower the reality flooded over us we sat there in our family room , holding hands , mesmerized , not being able to move away from the tv how could this be happening ? it seemed like only minutes later that abc news switched to washington , dc and we hear that flight crashed into the pentagon and then flight crashes in shanksville , pa i remember thinking , my god , what next ? , were killed and thousands more family and friends had a piece of them also die that day these numbers do not take into account the thousands of firefighters , police officers and medical staff that participated in the rescue but every one of us was affected and we will never forget what happened our view of reality changed that day it was hard for any of us to believe that there are certain people in this world that want to kill innocent men , women and children non combatants to further their cause became a rallying cry like pearl harbor to those in the s is a way for all americans to join together for a common cause and belief and like pearl harbor , as a result of this atrocity , our nation is stronger today is one of those days where the entire nation comes together in thought and prayer no matter where we are in the world i am certain that we will all will pause and remember world trade center collage by danny hahlbohm we must never forget !
