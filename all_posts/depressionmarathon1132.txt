i'm having a slug day it 's cold , grayer than gray outside , and sleeting , snowing , or raining most of the time i made it to my aa meeting this morning and went out to breakfast , as we often do , with women after the meeting came home stuffed with some fine blueberry pancakes intending to go workout intentions do n't count for much i 've been sitting in my chair snacking and watching football , crime shows , and football ever since had to turn the minnesota game off they were getting whipped ! i could be at the gym , exercising , while watching football , crime shows , and football i could be walking puck he got his staples out yesterday and needs to be walked twice per day i could be writing for my blogs oh , i guess i am doing that at least i could be raking piles of leaves in my yard they are wet , but i almost prefer them wet they do n't fly away , and they 're easier to bag bummer , alabama just fumbled the ball at the goal line it went out of bounds lsu gets the ball at the i could be sending out more resumes and following up with potential employers i heard some bad feedback from a former employee of one potential employer , one that i 've interviewed with another pt i know just quit working for the same office does n't make me feel too warm and fuzzy about them as employers bummer , lsu just threw an interception deep in their own end i could be looking into personal trainer classes i took a continuing education class days ago which made me question why the hell i have n't pursued becoming a personal trainer yet touchdown , alabama i 've always wanted to be a personal trainer it is a perfect fit for me ! but , like many things i 've always wanted to do , i 've been too chicken to pursue it ! god forbid i actually do something i'm good at and passionate about ! it seems like the more i want to do something , the more afraid i am to do it how stupid is that ? ? it 's that fear of failure again i have less fear about things i'm less passionate about , so i do those things instead dumb i 've always thought i 'd be a good coach , too , especially a running coach , but no ! too scary pathetic beautiful pass , beautiful catch lsu scores thankfully , the functional exercise class i took from a very intelligent , energetic personal trainer may have pushed me forward you guys can keep me honest on this one , okay ? oooooh , alabama fumbled the kick off lsu recovered on alabama 's i need to look online to check into available personal training classes to become licensed i need to make a call to see about funding thirty yard td run lsu leads it 's time to just do it speaking of just doing it i 'll go workout at halftime i promise
