there is a popular song right now with a line i find particularly poignant in february seven , the avett brothers sing , there 's no fortune at the end of a road that has no end that line is the reason i am sitting up , now , in the middle of the night composing this post i ran miles yesterday i ran for three hours and three minutes how was i able to do that when feeling so low ? i was able to do it because there was an end to the road running long distances , like miles or a marathon , can be quite uncomfortable , often painful , and always a ton of work but i can do it because there 's a fortune at the end of the road i can endure the pain and discomfort because i know i will feel better in a matter of hours or minutes with my depression , the road , for the past years , has had no end i 've had multiple relapses , treatments , and hospitalizations i 've always known each relapse was going to be temporary , and that often helped me endure but this time , my thinking has been different i have been focused on the relapses rather than the recoveries i 've been negatively focused on the endless road , and there is no fortune at the end of a road without an end i think i set myself up for failure when i left the hospital last december i really felt like i had turned a corner that relapse was so painful , so difficult , so debilitating , and yet i survived i know i did n't expect to feel so low again so soon i figured i must have earned at least a few years worth of relapse free illness to be so low again , within months , not years , of getting well has really taken a toll on my thinking my doctor and i talked a lot about my thinking and how it may contribute to my depression the other day actually , as is the case when i'm feeling very low , she did most of the talking i sat there feeling scolded for thinking negatively , though i know that was not her intent i think her point was just what i said during this relapse , my thinking has gotten pretty negative this is a subject about which i am particularly sensitive in fact , i 've done an entire post on negative thinking actually being a symptom , not a cause , of depression but the stigma out there among many normies is simple , change our thinking , think happier thoughts , and our depression will be relieved it 's not that simple , but that does n't mean it 's not entirely true when feeling well , i work on thinking positively , on not sweating small things , and on being compassionate and humble the combination of years of cognitive therapy and twelve step work have led me to a simpler , happier life this simpler life has been due to a change in my approach to the world , which is to say a change in my thinking for example , gratitude was a foreign concept to me years ago now gratitude and humility are a huge part of my life and my being however , over the past couple of weeks gratitude has been thrown out the window i have n't been holding onto what 's good in my life instead , i 've seen only gloom and doom on the horizon even if this relapse is going to be temporary , as it certainly will be , instead of recovery i have been focused on the endless road of relapses ahead reflecting on my recent thoughts highlights that focus i could n't believe i was going through another relapse i could n't imagine i deserved to feel so low again why me ? why again ? why now ? suicide felt like the only option , as i knew actually a thought i could n't go through the depths of despair all over again , and i knew thought that this relapse would only be followed by another , and another , and another no matter the work i have done what was the point ? these negative thoughts certainly have not , as my doctor pointed out , helped me get through this relapse , and may , in fact , be prolonging it instead the solution is simple , which is not to say easy i 've got to work on my thinking i 've got to refocus my energy i 've got to focus on the fortune at the end of this road , this temporary road i am currently on i 've got to endure the discomfort and the pain after all , it may only be hours , even minutes , until this road ends i ca n't predict the path ahead i do n't know anything for sure i can only live , and run , in today
