in driving back from long beach , california , on tuesday , november th , in fresno , i picked up a passenger and what a passenger ! i had stopped at denny 's for a burger and , short of dog food , a hamburger patty for scout there were two ramps to enter the restaurant near the base of the left ramp sat a scruffy looking old man hunched over a red anodized aluminum walker , exuding a very negatory vibe , shock of hair in every direction , no upper teeth , beard of neglect , bloodshot eyes and a hunched habitus so i avoided him by going up the right hand ramp this i did twice but when it came to dispose of the box in which scout 's patty came , i had to walk by the man to the trash and it was then i made my mistake i asked him how he was doing and he said , not very good and instead of 'too bad ! , i , whether by psychiatric habit or christian politeness , chose to listen to his tale of woe and intervene call him humphrey , a year old electrical engineer whom the doctors have given three months to live i love these stories , i have rarely had a patient who did n't have a story about how he or a family member had been pronounced terminal and miraculously survived to eventually bury his doctor ! he had been traveling by bus back to oregon when he was robbed in fresno and relieved of his wallet , keys , and other valuables all he had were a few dirty clothes in as beat up athletic bag , a thin sleepng bag , and his walker his only id consisted of hospital discharge papers , which did him no good when i took him to the dmv in fort bragg , which required a birth certificate and with no id he could n't access his funds , though he purported to be a relatively wealthy man , at least compared to me we rested at my place in mendocino for three nights while i wrestled with what to do with him there are no social services adequate to provide a man with personalized care while traveling , which is exactly what humphrey needed , being near entirely helpless because of his crippling neurodegenerative disease i asked my stepson if he wanted to drive humphrey home for the promised mile up and back , but his car was n't running and he was pissed at me for whatever reason , so when i presented the offer to him he immediately called the police , thinkng a restraining order was in force when it was n't , as it was veteran 's day and i had not yet been served afterwards a nice policeman , a sargent , escorted me to the station where i received the necessary papers forbidding me to come near my wife and stepson until a hearing on december why they feel they need protection from me i 'll never know i 've spent the last eleven years protecting and providing for them , and i 've saved derek from suicide once and kathleen , twice i 've delivered derek from prison , jail , and a dead end life in a metal shack in oaxaca , mexico but people get strange ideas in their heads i can be very intense , and it was sometimes hard to distinguish whether i was manic or filled with the spirit over these last months , so i may have appeared threatening to the undiscerning eye , but know that i have never touched kathleen physically as for my condition i am happy to report that i am indeed filled with the spirit and not mentally ill i have never violated a restraining order , nor would i i respect my mate 's need for privacy for as long as she needs it and i would never jeopardize our love by insinuating my presence into her life when it was unwelcome , though i weep frequently over her absence it finally came to me that i was the only logical person to get humphrey home , though i hate to drive , especially since i suffer chronic back pain and driving aggravates it but humphrey needed a doctor , especially one also trained in the humility of a hospice worker , as i have been as for humphrey 's condition , he suffers from severe emphysema , mononeuropathy multiplex , spots on his kidneys , multiple melanomas , is addicted to cigarettes and alcohol and is the grumpiest man and most demanding person i ever met ! it 's the multiplex that 's really messed him up it is a poorly understood syndrome of multiple foci of damage to peripheral nerves , and i included a link above in humphrey 's case it is crippling his hands are so bad , for instance , so that he needed me to put a cigarette in his mouth , light it , and remove it from his fingers near the end of the smoke before he burned himself , as he could only clutch it between immovable fingers like some weird exotic bird and had no way to extricate it from his knuckles yet he was constantly demanding cigarettes , which i bought him , and afterwards i would sometimes have to hold his albuterol inhaler to his mouth and hit the button in time with his inhalation to counteract the effect of the cigarette smoke in addition i had to keep him constanty supplied with vodka and coke , or failing a liquor store , steel reserve , oz , which he could drink through a straw with the can positioned in my van 's cup holder as he leaned forward and if he ever uttered a thank you , it was in a gruff , semi apologetic voice , as if it pained his pride to say it for here was a man who had bossed twelve electrician crews in construction , a man used to authority , a man of business his helplessness was killing him though he was loathe to admit it he would n't even admit to bad luck but is this bad luck ? he has no family in this world , having buried his older brother his wife and son were killed in a car accident years ago he was stricken with this neurodegenerative disease years ago and has been steadily worsening truly he needs hospice care but i , being a doctor and a hospice volunteer , was prepared for his case i just did n't think it would cost me over miles of driving and a night in jail to boot to be continued namaste , ce
