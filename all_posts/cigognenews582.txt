i have written extensively about repression and its lifelong damaging effects the more i see of life the more i understand how deleterious repression can be first of all , we need to understand that for almost every pain there is the commensurate repression and the earlier and more remote the pains the greater the extent of repression these pains call into being their antagonist and the stronger the repression the more likely there will be disease , symptoms and decreased longevity it is not the pain so much as the consequences of repressing it we are putting a lid on an enormous force , a force that requires expression because the valence of pain is always higher as we descend down the evolutionary chain , later causes of disease can be imputed to our earliest traumas remember again , that lack of fulfillment of basic need even from our time in the womb , constitutes a trauma it doesn t have to be obvious in fact , it is the less obvious of traumas that cause the most trouble yet they are easy to ignore the more life and death the experience the heavier the load of repression and that can lead to an equally castastrophic life and death affliction that is why i believe that womb life and birth trauma contribute heavily to later disease it is not simply a belief taken out of the air it is based on decades of observation of patients from many different countries of the world , to say nothing of a passel of related research the evidence is mounting that relates early pre verbal traumas to later disease in my life before birth book i cite dozens of scientific studies that indicate how heart disease , stroke and cancer have their origins during the time we are being carried by our mothers the investigators do not allude to repression these are correlation studies so many traumas at birth , so great the chance of this disease or that these are statistical truths we are after a bit more biologic truths we want to explain why these symptoms occur later on what better way than to probe the unconscious of the patient ? what we see is that the earlier the trauma the more exaggerated inordinate the response that difficulties in the carrying mother often lead to an ill child kidney disease , migraines , epilepsy , unable to sit still , anxious , etc that these afflictions are also accompanied by deviant neurotic behavior , high agitation levels , lack of concentration and focus , poor sleep and many other signs of overload massive repression can lead , in my opinion , to shattering illness such as cancer i know it will shorten our lives ok so we all agree now what ? we need to lessen the repression how do we do that ? we attack the pain , not attack , exactly we feel it , as mundane as that sounds not so easily done since the defense system and repression won t let it happen we have to start with evolution in reverse we feel small current pains , move to childhood , then infancy , then birth and finally , gestation it is not done overnight it takes many months , at the very least but we cannot abrogate the law of nature and of evolution and hope to help patients get well so rebirthing is out , period so is forced crying or screaming or batting the walls in fact , anything forced is wrong it is gentle process if done right no one is rushed into great pain we know that repression sets in automatically because the system could not accept and integrate the early trauma as the system is more mature we can tolerate more pain but who decides when and where ? the patient s biologic system , of course this is wonderful ! nothing to figure out nothing to foresee , no special goal that we make for the patient she makes her own goals and her feelings does it for her she feels one pain , it triggers off another related pain , and so on in french it is called an engrenage it takes time because we arrive at the heaviest pains last , and therefore the most obstinate symptoms or behavioral deviation is resolved last for it is the very early traumas that pack the most lifelong impact we can measure that impact through brainwaves and the vital signs , as well as through the biochemistry we don t have to guess as to impact it is right there in the vital signs we only need to know how to interpret them so what makes for suicidal tendencies ? when we see a reliving for birth or infancy trauma we know and the patient tells us about its power with biologic truth so much is clear with statistics we have to find a control group and do fancy calculations and what do we find ? a correlation between this set of facts and that set we don t really have to think much because the figures tells what we want to know there is a difference between statistical calculating and real thinking
