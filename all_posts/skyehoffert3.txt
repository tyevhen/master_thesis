so i sent my submission in for the roogle wood press contest i was going to wait until the twentieth , i was going to let all my feedback trickle in and then send it i instead fixed the edits i had gotten and read it out loud to myself chopped it down to size and with a quick prayer sent it off i felt confident , like maybe i had done enough i had worked on this story for seven months , i had developed this grungy circus that is part of a dark fae world the characters had all shown their motivations , weaknesses , and strengths more feedback trickled in the next day , some readers thought the romance was a bit sudden i did n't get any major criticisms , all of the edits were things that i had already fixed thanks to the lovely alexa who has been going over my story with a fine toothed comb i started doubting myself i'm still doubting myself maybe i should have rewritten certain parts , maybe i should n't have ended with a kiss that was something i agonized over , it 's cliche , it 's cheesy , it 's everything i hate i went with my gut , with what the characters would do also , i am the last person who should be writing a kissing scene cringing just thinking about it i hope i did enough i hope my love for this story and characters comes across on the page i do n't want it to be flat and cliched as i was reading it back to myself , certain parts hit me hard the parts that i inadvertently took from my own life those parts feel raw and real to me it 's scary to let people read it , and judge it i had amazing beta readers by the way , they were so supportive and helped shaped this story i'm just a tea and anxiety fueled bean right now so sorry for this mess of a blog post on a completely unrelated note i saw the last jedi ! ! ! ! ! i will post a review , but i freaking loved it did i become complete kylo ren trash possibly
