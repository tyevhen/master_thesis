dear a b curtiss we are studying your book , depression is a choice , in my abnormal psych class the professor told us that we could email you questions i have two questions question you say all depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in your brain what is the chemical imbalance you refer to ? answer if you are depressed , ipso facto , you have a chemical imbalance in your brain depression is the by product of our human psychological defense system our defense system is activated by fearful or anxious thoughts , of which you may or may not be aware , that trigger the fight or flight response the chemical imbalance of depression is caused by the inadvertent triggering of the fight or flight response which dumps stress chemicals into our brain chemicals like adrenaline , epinephrine , norepinephrine , etc to biochemically prepare us for immediate action if we take immediate physical action , the stress chemical imbalance is righted and we return from the stress mode sympathic mode to the at rest mode para sympathetic mode but if physical action is not taken , these chemicals are extremely hard on the metabolic processes of the body they cause the feelings of weakness and powerless that we know as depression of course once these neural patterns of weakness and powerless are part of our memory system , they can take on a life of their own and be triggered by a color , a sound , or some thought fragment through the natural process of learned association if we entertain and focus on these neural patterns in effect memories which we incorrectly believe to be present reality , we trigger the fight or flight response once more and the stress chemical factory is back in business again instant re run question what is the correct amount of chemicals you are striving for ? answer i am striving for the correct balance of chemicals which return us from the stress mode the sympathetic mode to the para sympathetic mode , our natural mode of okayness the way to effect this return as an act of will is to brainswitch to cease focusing on the agitated feelings of the subcortex , and instead think neutral or nonsense thoughts that stimulate neural activity in the neocortex thus powering up neuronal activity in the neocortex and powering down neuronal activity in the subcortex if a person concentrates on thinking neutral or nonsense thoughts for five or ten minutes , they cannot at the same time continue to think those stressful thoughts that have been causing the fight or flight response to trigger which produce the stress chemicals that have pitched them into the sympathetic mode as they continue with cognitive , objective , and neutral thoughts , they cease to produce stress chemicals , and the body will naturally return to the para sympathetic mode it is a matter of constantly taking the correct fork in the thinking road instant by instant as soon as depression hits avoid the subjective , choose the objective not oh i'm feeling bad , but is n't that an interesting pattern of light on the wall avoid the emotional , choose the neutral or nonsense not oh i'm feeling bad but row , row , row your boat or some othedumb nursery rhyme or song avoid the downer thought and choose the upper not oh what a dreary morning , but hey , at least the house is n't on fire , how great is that ! avoid self focus , choose outer focus not i'm feeling bad but send some healing prayer to another person avoid disengagement , choose re engagement do n't crawl under the covers , get out and take a walk , talk to the paperboy
