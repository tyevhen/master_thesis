the below link to an article in huffpost healthy living by brandon bailey of the associated press was posted in the kda forum these type apps could be beneficial those of us living with kennedy 's disease sbma who have difficulty traveling to nih or other distant research facilities it appears the apps could be used to monitor certain clinical trial information including progression , side effects , gait , etc this would have been useful for the clinical trial on exercising also the article mentions that people are more involved in the studies because of these apps they have some control and are needed to participate to monitor and send the information being collected it was interesting to me that over , people have enrolled in studies using these type apps i can see where this would be great for many studies where normally you would have to return to the hospital , doctor 's office , or research facility to be tested or evaluated regularly i would think that another benefit is the data can be more easily collected , stored and analyzed of course , the comment on maintaining the privacy of the user and the information reported is still something that is a concern check it out and let me know what you think thanks this phone app lets you contribute to research on your own disease
