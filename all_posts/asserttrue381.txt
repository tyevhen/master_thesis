i'm thrilled that bigthink com saw fit to headline my aspirin for cancer prevention story today people need to know what big pharma and government agencies charged with public health wo n't tell them that the scientific evidence for anti cancer effects of ibuprofen , aspirin , and other nsaids is , at this point , solid beyond reproach this is what cancer prevention looks like drug companies and government wo n't tell people the facts about nsaids because the cancer treatment industry is a multi billion dollar profit making machine too big to undercut with news of cheap , effective , well tolerated , widely available preventive measures as i 've reported previously , since president nixon declared war on cancer in , we in the u s have spent the equivalent of approximately , in research dollars for every single person who has died of cancer in the last years one would think , given this backdrop , any drug or substance that promised even a reduction in this top two leading cause of death would be heralded as a major advance not so the harris meta analysis involving epidemiological studies published in oncology reports in found risk reductions , for daily takers of aspirin , of as much as for colon cancer , for esophageal cancer , for stomach , for breast , and for lung cancer if these rates are anywhere near true , the mere act of not publicizing this data means public health agencies never mind the drug companies are guilty of negligent homicide please tell your friends and family and anyone else whose health you care about to consider the evidence for themselves and draw their own conclusions yes , there 's a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding with nsaids yes , there 's a risk of tinnitus if you take too much of these drugs no one 's suggesting you take more than a minimal dose but the risk of not taking them is far worse do n't you think ?
