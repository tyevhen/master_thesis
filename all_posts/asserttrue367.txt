it should n't come as a surprise , but you ca n't be mentally ill and work for the cia , any more than a marine corps sergeant can work for islamic terrorists yet those are , in fact , the unlikely backstories of the two main characters on showtime 's ber popular tv drama , homeland , loosely based on the israeli drama hatufim abductees , packaged for english audiences as prisoners of war a full review of homeland will have to wait for some other time right now , i just want to point to homeland 's handling of scene cuts , as a reminder to fiction writers and storytellers generally of the effectiveness of the time honored trick of entering a scene late and leaving early generally , in tv land , the trick is more like enter early , leave early , but the point is we do n't need to see the whole scene to get the gist telling the whole story is overkill viewers of tv shows do n't like overkill , and neither do readers of novels it 's a strange homecoming for marine sergeant nick brody , in more ways than one there 's a critical scene where newly liberated pow nicholas brody played by damian lewis , coming back from iraq after eight years in captivity , gets to inform his wife that he 's on his way home no one has yet told her about the rescue operation that freed him brody insisted that he be the first to tell his wife i quote now from the pilot episode 's script int pentagon morning wearing a yellow ribbon , jessica brody , perpetually but charmingly harried , arrives at her boss 's office she knocks and enters without waiting for permission colonel michael faber looks up from his desk jessica sorry i'm late on that report , but stan promised he 'd send over his budget yesterday faber jessica oblivious to faber 's real purpose , she plows ahead jessica he 's always got some excuse faber jessica she stops , hearing the gravity in his voice faber cont'd that 's not why i asked you in here you have a phone call jessica tell me what 's wrong , mike , because you 're scaring me something 's happened to my kids ? faber nothing 's wrong faber 's reassuring smile shows some strain as he stands faber cont'd i should give you some privacy line two he closes the door behind him , leaving jessica alone with the blinking phone as she slowly lifts the receiver jessica into phone hello ? intercut int ramstein afb office night brody is wearing a white t shirt and khakis brody into phone jessica ? she blinks , disbelieving what she 's hearing brody cont'd it 's me brody jessica brody ? outside the office faber watches her through the glass , with an oddly pained expression end of scene so note two things first , most writers would have begun the scene with an underling leaning into jessica 's office to say the boss man wants you i do n't know what it 's about , but it seems urgent or perhaps the phone rings and it 's faber saying can you come to my office for a minute ? none of that here secondly , most writers would have considered this scene so important after all , it 's a woman hearing the voice of her officially presumed dead pow husband on the phone for the first time in eight years that they would surely have included more dialog than just the characters saying each other 's names not so , here as soon as the moment of astonishment is recorded , we briefly cut to the face of faber , outside the office then the scene is over faber , it turns out , had been involved romantically with jessica , in brody 's absence he knows it 's over now word , word , expression , done the next scene is one in which the stunned wife played by morena baccarin comes home to tell her children a son , , and a daughter , going on that their dad is not only alive after eight years of captivity but on his way home this is a pretty important scene , right ? it deserves a bit of drama it 's interesting to see how the show 's writers in this case , alex gansa , howard gordon , and gideon raff handle it they handle it by showing us year old chris brody playing call of duty on xbox as mom arrives home early from work finding chris in front of the tv , she asks him where 's your sister ? the boy acts confused nervous and asks mom why she 's home early jessica says i need to tell you both something very important the daughter , dana , is upstairs jessica charges upstairs with chris is tow it turns out dana is in her bedroom engaged in heavy petting with her boyfriend , kyle when mom bursts in , the teens are buttoning their clothes dana how come you 're not at work ? jessica tries to keep her voice even jessica how come i'm not at work ? i hardly think that 's the question here who 's he ? dana kyle jessica well , kyle , it 's nice to meet you now get out dana nods to kyle , dismissing him dana i 'll call you later kyle grabs his shoes , jessica calling after him as he slinks out the door jessica and you can tell your parents i 'll be calling them too dana why are you making such a big deal out of this ? jessica gee , dana , i do n't know it 's either the underage sex dana overriding we did n't do anything , we were just fooling around jessica overriding or the lying chris mom jessica ignoring him all i'm asking for is a little respect , dammit not a lot a little chris louder mom jessica what ? chris you said you had something important to tell us jessica puts a hand to her mouth , shakes her head dana suddenly concerned what is it , mom ? what 's the matter ? on jessica , about to tell them then we dissolve to the next scene where faber picks up the family to take them to andrews air force base to get dad this is of course a classic example of leaving a scene early way , wayyyy early we do n't even get to see mom tell the kids dad 's coming home ! nine out of ten writers would have had the mom sit on the bed with the kids and begin an ultra dramatic dialog around dad coming home tears would start to flow faces frozen in disbelief mom , are you sure ? all that sort of thing none of that here what was the scene about , then ? it 's about sergeant brody it 's about what the poor bastard missed while he was in a cave for eight years in afghanistan the little boy that was hardly out of diapers the last time he saw him is now playing photorealistic combat games on xbox the little girl who was when he left is now a young woman with raging hormones brody has been robbed of the one thing no man ever wants to be robbed of watching his kids grow up the fact that his wife had a fling with another man suddenly pales in comparison does n't it ? you can rebuild a marriage you ca n't roll back time it was a brilliant move by the writers naturally , i have to ask you what brilliant and daring choices are you making in your own writing ? are you giving in to the urge to show oh so moving scenes in luxurious detail , thinking you 're doing the reader a favor ? are you laying a lot of predictable dialog on us when it 's not really needed ? or are you letting the characters' actions and situations tell us things that , words of dialog could n't possibly tell any better ? it 's not just a matter of show versus tell it 's a matter showing just enough , just in time it 's the old less is more routine except , less may be much more than you think food for thought munch on it the script for the pilot of homeland is here season three begins september on showtime old episodes are shown friday nights all this month in the u s to view the premier episode of season online free , try going here
