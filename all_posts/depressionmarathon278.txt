i'm on my fourth cup of coffee already today , and it 's just after noon i 've been very busy this week , and i guess it 's finally caught up with me today i'm tired but i'm doing well my mood has been slowly improving since last weekend the time of my last post , sunday morning , seems to have been a turning point my direction changed the downward , dark spiral stopped and light began to reenter my life i 've been on a slow , upward trajectory ever since the light reentering has been such a relief a relief , yes , that 's been my primary reaction i'm so grateful i'm no longer in free fall the improved mood allowed me to take care of my business this week and i 've been busy as my mood improved , i noticed a little more energy that allowed me to work an extra day and earn some extra money , which i 'll need when i'm unable to work after my hip surgery next month i'm going to try to get some extra hours each week until my surgery i do n't have any benefits , so no vacation time , or pay , after my surgery , although i will likely miss at least a couple of weeks of work the extra energy also came in handy when it came to training after missing a week of training because of my mood and bronchitis it was nice to get all of my runs in this week i even did a little speed work that really wore me out , but it was great to run fast again i still have to run today i have miles on the schedule unfortunately , i woke up woefully tired this morning i'm now finishing my fourth cup of coffee , and i 've already taken a one hour nap perhaps by the time i finish my mound of laundry i 'll have generated enough steam to get out the door i'm sure i 'll get my run in somehow , but regardless i'm happy to feel the light again i hate this illness i hate the ups and downs which always seem to surprise but i'm so relieved to be on an upward rather than downward trajectory today i 'll take it , fatigue and all
