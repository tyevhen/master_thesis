it 's a big day today twelve years ago today i began my journey into recovery i 've been sober for years wow writing that down it 's barely believable i never thought i 'd be sober this long it 's truly a miracle twelve years ago i never could have imagined how tremendously my life would change as a result of getting sober i do n't know what i expected , probably a miserable life without my favorite coping mechanism , but that 's not what sobriety reaped i stopped medicating my depression , and my depression got better i stopped spending my free time drinking , and all my time got better i became a valued employee , a more faithful friend , a responsible patient , a more respectful daughter , and a compassionate person who knew sobriety could reap such rewards ? i feel very lucky and quite proud to be celebrating years of sobriety today i do n't know why i got it when so many others have n't perhaps it 's because i became teachable for the first time in my life i did what was suggested and took it one day at a time but i 've seen others who appeared teachable , who appeared committed , who said the right things , and they did n't get it why me and not them ? i do n't know i'm proud of the work i 've done , but i feel lucky to be here years later , nonetheless this is a big day i'm grateful for the life i 've created , a life which never would have been possible if i had continued drinking i'm grateful for my job , my friends , my house , my dog i'm grateful i can handle situations which used to baffle and confound me i'm a contributing member of society today , and i'm proud of that today i have choices addiction does not allow for choices it also does n't engender responsibility i am responsible for creating the life i lead i know that now and it 's a life i get to choose only because i am sober that 's a gift
