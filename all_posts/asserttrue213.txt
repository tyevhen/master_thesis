abilify is the top selling prescription drug in the u s , a ranking it has held for a couple of years now what 's astonishing is that this drug was originally approved as and only used as an antipsychotic my wife , who has schizoaffective disorder , is an experienced user of abilify , haldol , latuda , zyprexa , and saprhis she will attest to the antipsychotic properties of abilify and i 'll show a graph for efficacy further below but treatment of psychosis is not what made abilify the top selling drug in the u s abilify is now widely prescribed as an adjunctive drug for depression plus other uses , both on label and off label the manufacturer says abilify is indicated for use as an add on treatment to an antidepressant for adults with major depressive disorder who have had an inadequate response to antidepressant therapy treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar i disorder in adults and in pediatric patients to years of age treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents to years of age treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder in pediatric patients to years of age physicians and consumers alike have bought into the abilify as an adjunct idea in a big way why has this adjunct modality become so popular ? the main reason is that regular antidepressants simply are n't very effective , and people in a desperate mental state naturally want to know what else can be done other than switching from one ineffective drug to another but how good is abilify , really , as an adjunct to antidepressants ? here is the graph touted on the abilify website abilify 's efficacy as an adjunct to antidepressants , versus placebo click to enlarge the vertical scale plots average change decrease in patient scores on the montgomery sberg depression rating scale this graph pools data from three studies it shows that the average drop in madrs score for patients on placebo plus antidepressant is a drop of points after weeks from a starting average score of when abilify is added to the mix , the average score drop is points so if you add abilify , you can expect a point drop in your madrs score that you would n't otherwise have had but if you look at the madrs test , a change in just one answer e g , better sleep could easily produce a point change in your score what you need to ask yourself is whether this magnitude of change is clinically significant if you found a dollar bill on the sidewalk , your madrs score would probably change by points briefly , of course if your tax refund was larger than you expected , it would probably mean a point change on madrs the point is , the magnitude of change we 're talking about here is small it may be statistically significant , but is it clinically significant ? abilify 's primary use is in treatment of schizophrenia symptoms here 's the efficacy graph for improvement on the panss scale , a common rating system for assessing schizophrenia symptoms abilify efficacy with respect to schizophrenia symptoms placebo in grey this is a much different graph it shows what anyone would call good separation from placebo five to eight times bigger change , with abilify , than with placebo alone abilify costs over a thousand dollars a month mg , pills if you were to have to pay for it out of pocket for most patients , this cost is hidden by insurance or medicare , in my wife 's case if you were taking abilify for depression as an adjunct and had to pay for it out of pocket , you 'd probably find the cost depressing to the tune of much more than a point drop in madrs still , desperate people will do desperate things adding abilify is one more thing to try so by all means try it but do n't expect miracles if you see any effect at all , it 's likely to be a rather small one buy my books or click to find out more , at least have you added your name to our mailing list ? thank you be well
