i know i seem to rant against what i call half therapy , or almost therapy , that is , a therapy that encompasses only a piece of us and neglects the feeling human part but there is a reason for my rant , i read yesterday in science journal about a complex study of sleep problems and they plunged and plunged into neuronal circuits and came to bizarre conclusions , which seem quite rational to them it was because of overactive cortical function , activated limbic circuits , and on and on and that may be entirely true it is too technical to go into except that it is almost impossible for a non neurologist to understand ok so what they say might be true , so what is wrong with that ? it is a half truth you can t get well half way therein lies the rub , as i often say all that is missing are causes ultimate causes what made those circuits detour and over react ? why does various chemicals seem too high ? is that the cause ? well , we could go on guessing and batting down associated symptoms , until we actually see causes at work how do we know they are causes ? for many reasons one important one being that the problems seem to disappear after reliving the key factors and imprints that drive the neo cortex later on , into a frenzy that cannot seem to be turned off enough to let us sleep and not surprisingly , he was a hyperactive child who , according to his teachers , could not sit still always in motion the same drive to produce a hyperactive mind that cannot relax and fall asleep still driven , but now also mentally wait a minute is there a correlation ? it is what we have found because we look at history if you don t you will always get only half the information you need cannot continue to investigate de novo each new case of sleep problems and still think it is a matter of displaced neurons you may think that it is all in your mind but where ? could it be way down deep , reflecting trauma to the brainstem ? yes , but who looks there ? who sees the connection between gestational life and sleep problems at age thirty ? you cannot until you go there that is , until patients go there , a there the few recognize even exists most doctors seem to work as if there is no there , there so why even think about going there ? for patients , too , it seems dangerous and mysterious , reinforced by the doctor who also has no idea what is down there except something to be avoided and when the therapist has no idea about the brainstem all is lost , including the patient and the doctor therapy becomes a muddle , each feeling rumbles around in the dark for some way out alas , the way out is the way in , and that is where we part from other therapies one reason is that the way in , takes months , who has the patience to go there and take one s time ? anxiety waits for no man isn t it strange that we give pills for deep anxiety and sleep deprivation that work on the lower depths where origins lie , yet we miss the fact that maybe there are origins of this mess way back there and way down there ? all we have to do is go there ! but how ? i have written many blogs on the subject , books , and now there is a precise video description coming out by dr , france janov , called the primal legacy it is detailed and gives readers a thorough description of the primal process who can ask for any more ? i doubt it has been done before , mostly because the series is based in science and not haphazard musings we will not find answers to many perplexing psychologic problems until we stop the almost therapy and turn to the real meaning of holistic therapy which includes all of us , absolutely all of us we are not just a thinking brain we are above all , a feeling brain that helps us treat patients , relate to others , have empathy and compassion there is not a lot of that in a disembodied neo cortex
