i had to go to a funeral on friday the funeral was back in the town in which i spent many tortured years , and therefore i had multiple tortured memories and feelings about returning there i moved to this town , at age , from my beloved small town after my parents were divorced , and my dad remarried my wicked step mother and she was wicked in many ways abusive verbally and physically she and my abusive father made a lovely pair the only positive of moving to this new place , with this new family , was i gained a sister my step sister and i became very close due to the small size of our home , we had to share a bed we spent many nights sharing our thoughts and feelings into the wee hours of the mornings unfortunately , we spent many other nights listening to our parents complaining about one of us kids or beating the spit out of each other we developed an us against the world bond , and then she was killed in a freak bike vs car accident my first bout of depression began not long after my step sister was killed i spent multiple years battling the now familiar scourge unrecognized by my parents as an illness or even a real problem , i leaned on a teacher , she was also my neighbor , for support mrs hoffman kept me alive for years she listened she cared she recognized and acknowledged my pain although i ultimately nearly ended my life , i certainly would n't be here today if she had never intervened after the funeral on friday , i stopped in to see mrs hoffman for the first time in years i needed to tell her she made a difference i needed to express my gratitude and while seeing her brought back a lot of memories , i'm so glad i went it was as if we had never lost touch we talked for over two hours , and i could have stayed all day her home , still next door to my previous home , felt like the safe haven it had been so many years before seeing mrs hoffman , being welcomed back into her home , and thanking her for her life changing influence on my life these were all gifts which made being back in this tortured town a treasure rather than a curse
