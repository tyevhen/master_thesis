so here 's an interesting article in the irish times niamh o'donoghue writes in murderer accused was unable to refrain from killing the deceased because of medication withdrawal , psychiatrist tells court i 'll let you surf over there if you want to read more , the title says enough for me my first thought was really ? people stop their medications all the time , cold turkey , without doctor supervision or approval , and they do n't generally kill people so how do you know if someone 's symptoms like agitation are he result of medication withdrawal , or the result of a recurrence of the original illness that the medication was treating ? there 's not a great way to sort that one out , but i was befuddled by the idea that one would attribute murder to medication withdrawal maybe that should be on the tv commercials with the list of side effects , stopping this medication suddenly can lead you to kill people
