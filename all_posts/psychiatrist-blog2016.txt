second day in a row that i'm stealing ideas from dr crippen over at nhs blog i hope he does n't mind today , in making friends with the doctor , dr crippen writes about his preference for addressing patients by their last names surnames and he comments about physicians who address their patients by their first names i think it is presumptuous and impertinent it is done to give the feeling of a deep and meaningful personal relationship with the patient it is bogus it 's okay if i say that dr crippen has a way with words ? he goes on to take a survey of his readers , asking their opinions actually , blog polls seem to be the thing to do these days , dr a has his readers dressing him and telling him how to deal with his comments so back to the question of what should a doctor call a patient in psychiatry , where relationships are so intimate and boundaries are so essential , this stuff has meaning to start with , i'm a fairly formal person well , sometimes , but definitely at work it feels strange enough in blog o land to address physicians i 've never met as foofoo and especially fat doctor even shiny happy person is a bit of a stretch for me , but okay , it 's a blog , it 's what you want to be called and i'm not your psychiatrist at work , with very few exceptions i introduce myself to patients as dr shrinkrap no , not really , but you get the picture and i call folks by their last names so , it 's taken me this long to say that my blog post today is not about what i call my patients my blog post , instead , is about what my patients call me psychiatry , being a bit more intimate , and being in many ways similar to friendship , inspires patient to want to be my friend even clinkshrink wants to be my friend as such , some people , even people much younger than i , will not infrequently address me by my first name , sometimes over the phone before they 've met me , and sometimes after a few sessions i have to tell you , it does n't sit right to quote dr crippen , it feels presumptuous and impertinent and i feel like i should confront this , but the truth is it remains a bit uncomfortable for me mostly , i 've opted out it 's usually a thing that comes up on the phone where people are most apt to use names , and what i 've done so far is to simply ignore it , and to return phone calls with hello , mr x , this is dr shrinkrap , i'm returning your call i 'd say that mostly works , except that it always works people get the message , and probably i'm missing some great psychotherapeutic opportunity to discuss boundaries and presumption and all sorts of other things , but it feels just so stiff to ask someone why they think it 's okay to call their doctor by their first name , and often i imagine it 's about wanting a friendship and maybe that does n't always need to be dissected my favorite , by the way , were the series of calls i received from a patient 's physician spouse where the messages were left for me as dinah , this is dr smith and i want to speak with you about my husband if dr smith were say maybe it would feel okay , but let 's just say she 's not that old i lied i am going to talk a little about what i call patients because i want to be called dr shrinkrap , and i do n't like what dr crippen refers to as an adult child gradient or what i would call an imbalance of power and respect i'm most comfortable calling patients by their last names people often ask that i address them by their first names , and this feels very awkward to me , especially if the patient is my age or older for a while , i dealt with this by simply not using the patient 's name this actually is n't as difficult as it might sound , there 's not a whole lot of need for names in a one on one psychotherapy session where no one else is in the room when it comes up though , it does remain awkward on the one hand it feels disrespectful to address an adult patient by a first name , on the other hand it feels disrespectful to ignore a patient 's request to be addressed in a specific way i have , after many years and probably way too much thought , figured it out only recently when a patient asks that i use their first name , i now say , psychotherapy is very intimate work and because of that it 's important to have some boundaries using last names is one type of boundary having said that , it 's your name and i 'll call you anything you 'd like and so , dr crippen , what are we writing about tomorrow ?
