it 's wikipedia again i hate to single out wikipedia as a hopelessly putrid cesspool of amateur pedantry masquerading as knowledge , but frankly its authors some of them , at least not all leave me little choice one cannot wade into wikipedia 's murky waters , and hope to survive the experience , without wearing the linguistic equivalent of a hazmat suit recently do n't ask me why , i ran into the following bit of verbal chunder floating around on the cultural cognition page this is the first paragraph under the first subheading cultural cognition thesis of the article a study , by dan m kahan and his colleagues , collected data on the climate change risk perceptions of large representative samples of us adults the study measured assessments of two opposing viewpoints of public opinion on climate change science comprehension thesis sct argues that because the public does not presumably know the information scientists do about climate change , they do not take it as seriously cultural cognition thesis cct argues that people tend to form opinions of risk based on their social and cultural group they identify with cct model findings people , who subscribe to a hierarchical , individualistic world view that ties authority to social rankings and avoids interference with the decisions of such authority , tend to be skeptical of environmental risks they perceive that widespread acceptance of climate change risks would lead to restrictions on commerce and industry these are things hierarchical individualists value in contrast , people who hold an egalitarian , communitarian world view , which favors looser social organization and attending to collective needs over individualistic ones , usually are suspicious of commerce and industry as a result , they find those industries worthy of restriction the research data shows that egalitarian communitarians are more concerned than hierarchical individualists with climate change risks how does one even begin to tease apart such a confused tangle of pseudo academic blather ? the author of this entry begins by telling us about a study attributed , without a reference , to one dan m kahan and his nameless colleagues after two sentences , the kahan study is never heard from again instead , we go straight into science comprehension thesis which is never defined , and for which there is no wikipedia entry , but after one sentence , we never hear anything about that again , either i keep seeing the word hierarchical in this passage as in hierarchical individualists , but it 's not at all clear what the logical connection is between hierachy and any of the concepts presented why do we care about hierarchy ? what does it have to do with anything ? it turns out the connection with hierarchy traces to work done by cultural anthropologist mary douglas she introduces the concept in her book natural symbols explorations in cosmology which , interestingly enough , has nothing whatsoever to do with astrophysics a full discussion of douglas is beyond the scope of this blog , of course the important point is that by omitting a discussion of douglas 's well known to cultural anthropologists group vs grid way of looking at social organization , in which hierarchy is paramount , the author of the cultural cognition article not only confuses readers but destroys the meaning of the entire passage what 's the author trying to say ? the wikipedia entry is about cultural cognition , so let 's assume the author is trying to write about that it seems logical to start by stating what cultural cognition is so do that first then explain how the theory might be used to make some sort of predictions if research exists to support the predictions , mention it and give citations if my only task is to rewrite the paragraph shown above rather than seal it in a lead lined container and bury it in the nevada desert , i would oversimplify it as follows the cultural cognition theory of risk centers on the idea that people tend to form opinions of risk based on the values of the social group with which they self identify under this theory , people who favor an individual centric worldview tend to identify with a cultural perspective that devalues collective needs similarly , people who favor an egalitarian or communitarian worldview identify with a cultural perspective that values collective needs over individual ones these differing perspectives give rise to culturally biased risk perceptions , wherein an individual 's own assessment of risk is colored by , for example , political beliefs reference needed if it turns out that the foregoing explanation is too simplistic and ignores relevant aspects of douglas 's group grid theory , then group grid theory needs to be introduced first , with a paragraph that begins something like in order to understand cultural cognition theory , it 's first necessary to understand douglas 's group grid formulation of cultural worldviews if studies exist to back up the cultural cognition theory , they should be discussed in a separate paragraph and appropriate citations given but frankly , fixing this type of wikipedia entry is a fool 's errand the passage as written ca n't be made whole with mere revision any more than a toyota camry that 's been broadsided by a locomotive can be made whole with mere replacement of damaged parts it 's out and out junk unfixable garbage , front to back do not try to repair do not remove plastic cover no user serviceable parts in a word fubar
