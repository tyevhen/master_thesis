guess what ? i made some friends yesterday in the real world guess what else ? the crap blog detective is back , and this time he insulted my furniture uh oh what do these two topics have in common ? that 's bruce actually , it 's me inside bruce bruce is a dragon costume that i made out of a snuggie , a pair of nylons and a dog bed he is wearing sexy underwear because halloween is always a good excuse to dress like a whore , especially if you 're a dragon you may be wondering what bruce has to do with anything well , remember how i said that i made friends last night ? normally , i'm pretty shy around new people but not when i'm wearing bruce when i'm wearing bruce , all of my self doubt and social paranoia just melt away leaving behind pure , unadulterated confidence as soon as i put on bruce , i have abilities i can suddenly do things i never dreamed of i can walk into a party full of strange people and not end up hiding in the bathroom with a bottle of vodka until i'm drunk enough to not care about how awkward i am i can dance to 's music and gangster rap without relying too heavily on the lawn mower dance i can comfortably talk to strangers about breast milk , glory holes and blow jobs i can enter a sexiest costume contest and win even though i did n't actually win because some girl dressed up as a sexy gladiator and wore a push up bra and put glitter on her cleavage and even though she was n't nearly as sexy as me , no one was ready for what i brought and it kind of hurt my game i can lose a sexiest costume contest and still feel good about myself and my future babies actually like me and do n't start crying the second i get within ten feet of them i'm practically a superhero i even have an arch nemesis now it 's the crap blog detective and kyle i think it 's kind of fun having an arch nemesis it gives my life purpose now i have a reason to get up in the morning and make a striptease video i have a reason to do whatever i am going to do to the crap blog detective , which i have n't thought of yet , but the possibilities are endless and i have a dragon costume , so it 's probably going to be awesome anyway , i am getting kicked out of the caf with the free internet because they are closing i think they 're just jealous of my sexy dragon costume , but whatever p s i put my video up on youtube but do n't worry fame and fortune wo n't change me i mean , i have views already and i'm still just as humble as ever p p s a little girl stuck some of her halloween candy in my g string last night it was awkward especially because her parents both of them were watching and they totally thought i asked her to do it even though i did n't and probably never would because i am classier than that and frankly , their kid was a little creepy and it 's not my fault that sexy dragons are irresistible to children that 's me and some of my new real world friends i hope we can still be friends when i'm not wearing bruce it might be difficult to maintain a relationship that is based completely off of my halloween costume i'm not saying it would be impossible , just really complicated especially if we ever wanted to go to a water park or church or a movie
