you know , sometimes i'm overwhelmed simply by how much my priorities , ways of relating to others , and just myself in general , has changed this past year one big shift in priorities being the decision to no longer be as involved , online or other places , in unschooling advocacy as i have been in the past , of course because at this point ? i just get so damn frustrated all the time with the way people look at and treat me , with their swift and wildly inaccurate assumptions , rude queries , and possibly worst of all , simply how much of who i am and how i behave is attributed only and completely to the fact i was unschooled am ? i'm uncertain what educational labels i currently want to identify with especially when it 's people who i think are cool and want to get to know better , people i consider part of my community , who seem to be most likely subconsciously doing this it can feel remarkably hurtful to be reduced to nothing more than that unschooled person , whether deliberately or not luckily , most of the folks i consider cool to start with really are nice folk , so that phase passes , but it 's still pretty frustrating when it feels like this has to happen with most though not all of the more traditionally educated people i meet and get to know and yes , i do recognize that this happens for many different reasons to many different people i could just as easily be that anarchist person or that queer person , i guess but , that does n't really happen to me personally it 's always about unschooling i am just so tired of dealing with all that shit i was at a fundraising party for a cool art space last night , and the one unpleasant event to mar the evening was a person , upon finding out i 'd never been to school , who somehow imagined it was appropriate to turn to me and ask me a math question everyone else at the table i was sitting at seemed as taken aback as i was ! i got those types of very rude and condescending questions frequently while growing up , but this is the first time in several years that that 's happened to me i'm you 'd think that , even to the folks who justify being that rude to kids , that they 'd realize that type of behavior seriously crosses the bounds of politeness when dealing with adults i do n't mean to imply that this type of behavior is more appropriate when it 's aimed towards kids , and as an adult i certainly have a much easier time handling stuff like that but it most definitely is more surprising and unpleasantly unexpected ! my response was simply and truthfully that i decided years ago not to answer any quiz questions people rudely asked me and hey , i gave them my blog address , so maybe they 'll wander on over here and gain a better perspective on what unschooling is , and maybe even behave in a much more respectful manner to the next unschooler they meet for those wondering , no , my new level of frustration with dealing with other people 's shit does not mean i regret unschooling it does mean that i just wish people would get over it already , though i thought by now i 'd be done with all the annoying questions and reactions , and it 's slightly depressing to realize otherwise i find myself wondering if people will still be quizzing me on my math skills when i'm , or if by then they 'll be too busy attempting to quiz my own kids , no matter how old they are , and scolding me for being so irresponsible as to unschool them believe it or not , to give a bit of a life update , i continue to be really happy life is good but this blog keeps floating through my head , demanding some acknowledgement , and pouring out a few recent frustrations felt , for better or for worse , like a cathartic thing to do ! me being happy see , i told you i was ! for the last couple of months , i 've been volunteering with what 's essentially a catering kitchen , that works to support a really cool new art and community space called le milieu it 's a great project and group of people , and i'm so happy to be involved ! i 've also been thinking , recently , about maybe taking a university course or two thinking about how much easier my life would be if i could just go through the bit of bureaucracy needed to get into university , and then check university off in the next set of little education boxes i need to mark no longer would i confuse any government or otherwise bureaucratic organization , seeing how i seem all educated and whatnot , but not having that piece of paper to prove i'm good at memorizing shit and am thus truly educated it should n't matter , and almost always it does n't end up mattering , but it does take longer and lead to more confusion than i like dealing with i do n't know if i will end up taking a couple of classes , but it definitely is something i'm considering and in the meantime , i 'll continue to do what i 've been doing work in kitchens , experiment with fermenting various things , hang out with friends , read good books , spend way too much time shopping in thrift stores though not too much money , since i am pro at this , play music , ponder moving closer to all the action aka downtown montreal instead of the outskirts , and generally enjoy life i think that 's a very good plan
