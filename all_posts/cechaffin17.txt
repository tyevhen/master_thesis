for three days almost i have felt slightly better with no explanation no change in meds or therapy less rumination , esp about suicide i 've been reading the noonday demon again by andrew solomon , an excellent book i recommend he subtitles it an atlas of depression , and certainly the moniker is deserved meanwhile i summoned the courage to revise some of the dark sonnets posted here before i hope to offer the revised series in the coming weeks , beginning with today 's i namaste , craig i once more this fell infection of the mind galls itself , one wound gouges another this pus of pitted surfaces will find more cells to infiltrate , more smooth to smother i put a stethoscope upon my head to eavesdrop on the stuttering machine , heard nothing but the clawing of the dead inside a skipping jukebox s routine i dream of pills and guns and mangled cars , the sordid images of methods used they haven t answered is there life on mars ? as yet from judgment shouldn t i be recused until they do ? because no life in me obtains beyond blessed fatality
