i know i ve written about this issue many times but it is still an ever present part of my daily life some days , it s a just an annoying , nagging headache other days , it s a debilitating illness that leaves me bedridden the number one , main reason why i don t do things is because i feel like i am too fat i don t have a job because i can t handle getting dressed and thinking about my pants size every day the unknown of not having control over what i eat is too much to bear i worry about every meal and whether or not it will cause me to gain weight , even though i know i am not supposed to be worried about that anymore i don t help out at events or volunteer because i can t imagine dragging myself around , pound for pound , wherever i go it s like i am attached to a rope tied to a lead ball which weighs exactly the difference between what i currently weigh and what i want to weigh i ll just say it s really heavy and leave it at that i feel like i am too big to be social how can i converse with people when there is only one thing on my mind ? i am ashamed of what i look like no matter where i am or what i am doing i feel like i need a reason why i am the way i am so i can apologize for my appearance if i want to paint , i don t , because i feel like i should be exercising i don t play the piano because i should be exercising and i don t read because i should be exercising i know it s getting bad when i go through my list of coping skills and nothing helps i can t do anything when i get it in my head that i need to lose weight the only thing i can do is sleep so as to escape the torment in my head if i was really honest with other people about why i can t do something i would tell them , no , i m sorry , i can t , because i m too fat but i won t tell people that because it might hurt their feelings or they might not understand being fat is not even the real issue anyway it s just covering up the resurfacing depression it s good for me to talk through these bad thoughts , if only to distract me for a while however , when i am this way , it is so difficult to talk to another person about what s really bothering me i know my self worth is at a low because i don t want to be a burden on other people , even more than usual nothing anyone could say would convince me that i am not bothering them nothing i guess i just had a realization i can no longer ask for help i was never any good at it before either but i realize now that i am trying to pull myself up by my own boot straps again i can tell that i am beginning to isolate myself because i feel like my problems are insignificant , comparatively and i can see that the depression is coming back even if i could talk about these problems of mine , after , i feel even more miserable , more alone , more sad i don t know if the eating disorder causes the depression or if the depression causes me to cope with eating disorder behaviors but they are very connected when one comes back , so does the other eating disorders are so tricky because there are so many triggers little things that seem not to be such a big deal are a very big deal talking about health seems harmless yet can set me down a spiral eating certain foods can trigger e d thoughts eating when i m not hungry is probably the biggest trigger i know and , eating more than another person is also very difficult to handle when i eat , i have to fake it for a while that i m ok i have to fake it because i just ate i just did the thing i hate most in the world if i don t fake it , then i have to acknowledge that i m a hypocrite and would then have even more self hate e d triggers are all over the internet i ve almost given it up completely but then i wouldn t be able to blog and that i like blogging helps me i guess when that goes , i ll know i m in too deep i thought if i got into cooking and baking it would help i thought that i could turn this obsession into something productive i do like cooking it s a fun hobby and keeps my interest but i ve come to love the artistry of it , and even more than that , the perfection of it i like making something new or challenging and serving it to my husband , my family , or my friends i love to cook , but i still don t love to eat it when i m done the first bite is necessary to see if it passes the test after that , it gets more and more painful and i m back at square one blah so here we are again at the end of a depressing post i ll pretend that it s not as bad as it is , because all things must end if they re going to end anyway , they might as well end on a positive note for the sake of other people and their own hope one thing , i guess , that i can say is that i am still trucking on things aren t good , but i m still here i ve survived it so far i m miserable , but i m still alive and that s one thing to be thankful for also , i took a break and turned to prayer i don t know why i m surprised , but it helped this is what i read praise the lord for times and seasons , cloud and sunshine , wind and rain spring to melt the snows of winter till the waters flow again grass upon the mountain pastures , golden valleys thick with grain these words struck me as i read it , especial because of this time of mental turmoil there will be good days and bad days and everything in between but , i should still praise the lord i should praise him for this winter season the winter of the world , and the winter in my heart it will be spring again maybe not tomorrow or the next day , but soon spring will come well , i guess this ended on a good note after all
