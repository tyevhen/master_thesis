several of us at the kda are busy working on the redesign of the website our current website is fine , but its technology is ten years old and we cannot add capabilities because of some proprietary coding we have been brainstorming for several months and feel we have a good idea of what it will look like we are currently transferring the articles pages to the new site and within a few months should be developing the look and feel style and structure the concept of the landing page home will be focused on telling our story we hope to have a slide show on the home page that will be updated regularly with new messages , research updates , campaigns , human interest stories , etc we are thinking that the navigation structure will correspond to the kda s mission statement financially support and promote medical research to find a cure for kennedy 's disease share information about kennedy 's disease for those who seek it create a support system for those living with kennedy 's disease improve awareness of kennedy 's disease in the medical community increase public awareness about kennedy 's disease and its effects on families the home page menu will probably be about kennedy s disease promote research share information provide support increase awareness about the kda we believe we have identified our primary and secondary audiences seekers those concerned that they or a loved one has kennedy s disease those needing information and support families and friends living with kennedy s disease researchers doctors and scientists focused on kennedy s disease research supporters those interesting in helping the kda achieve its goals what also tried to determine what value we bring to each audience seekers provide information such as a list of symptoms , potential for misdiagnosis , testing available and dna labs , doctors familiar with the disease , and genetics and counseling information those needing support provide information guides , access to forums , chats , and personal contacts , awareness issues e g , anesthesia , current research including clinical trials , other needed information on subjects of exercise , medical information , travel , surgery , anesthesia , etc researchers provide information on applying for grants , a history of previous grant winners and their projects , current research supporters provide the kda story , mission , organization board of directors , scientific review board , committees , social networking facebook and twitter , and financial support donations , partners , where does the money go , help with starting a fund raiser , how to volunteer , brochures , etc even though we are still months away from launching the new site , there is a sense of anticipation building among those of us working on the project since none of us are professionals , i would appreciate any thoughts you might have regarding building a more user friendly website please leave a comment or drop me an email any thoughts would be appreciated
