so i click on to shrink rap and i notice that my post , off label in jail , is only half there mostly it 's just the clipped and pasted paragraphs from the ny times and it stops dead in the middle of the sentence what happened ? did i inadvertantly delete most of it ? did clink do something ? roy ? so , not wanting half my thoughts up , i figured i 'd save it as a draft and think about whether i wanted to redo it tomorrow only i did , and the half post remained up so , i decided to delete the entire thing , only it 's gone from the dashboard , but remains on the blog i try again to delete it , but it does n't exist to delete , but it 's there ! okay , and by the time i 've finished posting this , it will be gone and i 'll have to wonder if it ever existed is it bad that i 've passed these genes on to my offspring ? in terms of diagnosis let 's not go there
