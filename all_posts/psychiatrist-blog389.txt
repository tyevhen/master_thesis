over on pete earley 's blog , he 's posted a letter from desperate parents who ca n't get help for their son pete , as you may know , is a former washington post reporter , author of many books , and a mental health advocate yesterday , pete answered the letter with suggestions he solicited a panel to take turns responding , and today , i'm the one with suggestions here 's the letter , then do surf over to pete 's blog and check out the responses , more will be coming all week dear pete , we have tried to get our son professional help i think he has bipolar disorder , although he possibly could have schizophrenia we know he has an alcohol addiction he has not cooperated with hardly anything , and we ve been unable to get him to go to our local mental health center , although officials there said he is eligible for treatment we feel like our hands our tied the few times that we ve gotten him to a psychiatrist , our son denies that he is sick , won t take his medicine , and is extremely hostile to doctors for the short time he s being seen by them we ve had him in our house for several months with his erratic moods and high level of anger yesterday he asked to go to a homeless shelter and he is now on the streets if we try to visit him , he runs away his dad and i are at the point where we feel resigned that there is no hope nor help for our son the system has worked against us at every turn and he needs help people have recommended he needs to hit rock bottom and that we need to wait for him to want help we simply don t know what to do do we wait for him to hit rock bottom on the streets where we know he is not safe ? in our view , the mental health network has been ineffective at best , and is rolling the dice with people s lives now we can see how barriers in the mental illness system keep people from receiving basic services this has been hell for his dad and me , and i m sure worse for our son if you have any advice please let us know a concerned parent
