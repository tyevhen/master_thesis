you are stronger than you think anxiety can make you feel weak it can make you feel worthless and that you ca n't do things like others can but this is not true anxiety is just part of your body 's biological process and sometimes it can get out of control however with all of this anxiety comes triumph because every time you learn and find a way to cope , even if you feel that you have n't each experience makes you stronger you 're not going to die anxiety is your body 's way of keeping you alive even during a panic attack when you feel you 're not going to survive , it 's actually the reverse that 's going on in your body i once remember my counsellor telling me that you ca n't actually die from a panic attack because your body is actually doing what it needs to do to keep you alive you survive , every time ever had a really bad anxiety episode ? well , you 're here now and through it you got over that anxiety fulfilled moment and made it through the other side when you thought you would n't a weird thought , huh ! the mind can get confused too ! anxiety is present to keep us safe , but sometimes our anxiety attaches itself to things that are n't actually dangerous in a way , our minds are confused our body thinks there 's a threat when in fact there is n't and it 's about splitting this up and trying to understand the reality from what our mind believes is happening you 're not alone anxiety is extremely common everyone experiences anxiety but it just so happens that some people can have it so severely that it makes them ill and even in that case , you could name people within your group of friends with some level of anxiety disorder you 're not the only one facing this stay strong , amy xx
