dear ab my husband is verbally abusive emotionally abusive he has not spoken to me since last friday night , when at dinner , i said i was very tired i was not very conversant that night he slept on a sofa downstairs he has not returned or spoken to me since this is on the heels of a big blow up about a month ago over a conversation about a traffic light ! after yelling at me for hours he did not speak to me for several days what should i do now , as he refuses to talk to me the days pass by ? i do n't want to chase after him , that only makes things worse i do n't know how not to look needy clingy yet approach him my husband has much disdain for neediness , clinginess any signs of weakness or vulnerability i want to look strong nonchalant but also want to put this silence to rest this is not a good way to live thanks ! g o dear g o try something different for a change find a good book to read , or movies to watch and wait him out you did n't feel like talking for the evening maybe he does n't feel like talking for a month would n't it be interesting to find out how long he 'll go be pleasant you can still talk to him whether or not he talks to you so what if he does n't answer ? he is trying to make you feel bad by not talking to you , an old bully trick , perhaps because , like you , he doesn t know how else to handle this situation this is the only game he knows but the bully trick does n't work if you simply do n't feel bad here 's his game he 's not talking to you and you feel bad here 's your game he 's not talking to you and you feel just fine , and you are still pleasant and talk to him a b dear a b thanks so much ! i hear ya ! g o
