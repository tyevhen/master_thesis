later last night i decided i was hungry , having eaten a very late lunch and skipped supper , so i made myself some noodles vegetables and tofu in oriental peanut sauce next time i make that i 'll have to actually measure and post the recipe here today , i discovered some amazing new music dear mr president by jason fisher made me very sad i listened to it about times though , because it is also very moving , and very pretty i also really liked witness by ember swift if you 're interested in listening to either of those songs or a whole bunch of other ones in full for free , check out this link http www vegnews com music oh , and all those musical selections are from the july august issue of veg news i finished reading the articles i had n't gotten to previously , and found myself once again energized and ready to make a difference in the world i 'd advise checking it out , perhaps it can do the same thing for you i wrote a new poem today quite possibly the most difficult to understand poem i 've ever written at least according to my mom when i finished it she was the only one around , so i 've yet to get other opinions here it is hope is a powerful word how can you describe the spirit of an open night the shadow on the wings of flight to feel your mind the taste of summer on your tongue a glittering expanse of icy tears ten thousand souls in laughing song to smiling relate a shattered window held by will an only tree that 's growing still to try yet you ca n't describe the deepest whole an endless soul of night and light and windy skies of death and life and hands held high we simply know with tears of gladness filling cupped hands and hollow hearts if you would like to read some of my other poems it would make me very happy if you did even happier if you left a comment or two p , check out my poetry blog at www art is expressions blogspot com i wrote the start of another poem , but decided i did n't like it so stopped tomorrow , when i'm hopefully more awake , i'm going to write a letter of protest to cbc i find it disgusting that on one program , they talk about better animal rights laws fifth estate is re airing an older episode on the abuse of animals in entertainment yet they air the calgary stampede every year , where the animals are hurt and their lives put in danger for the entertainment of the masses i only wish our culture was evolved enough to no longer find entertainment in something that causes pain to others well , that 's enough for now listening to today witness by ember swift , dear mr president by jason fisher , tongue tied by faber drive reading veg news you might also like lovely music poetry poetry blog poetry project linkwithin
