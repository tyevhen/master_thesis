phew ! i spent the day , and i do mean the whole day , unpacking boxes i had n't touched in years wow it was a long day full of memories every box i opened contained multiple tightly wrapped surprises initially , it was like a strange christmas , but as the day went along , my heart got heavier every tightly wrapped surprise contained a memory and every memory brought forth a host of feelings it was a long day as i opened each box , some items transported me back in time instantaneously others required a bit more thought most of the memories were from my previous life , when i was one of two my ex left years ago , shortly after my depression began so almost every memory today was categorized as b d before depression or a d after depression after unpacking everything , i really did have a sense of leading two separate lives the photos were the most interesting besides the fact that almost all of the b d photos were also associated with my ex , there was another surprising difference between the b d and a d pictures my smile was different as recently as the year , depression began in november , i look very happy my smile is open and wide there is a light in my eyes which i no longer see i truly appear to be a different person than i am today and i think i am a different person my smile now is more reserved and self conscious it is the smile of someone who 's been to battle , and who 's battle may not yet be done it 's a weary and leary smile that makes me sad perhaps i should n't be sad after all , i have been through a long battle in ten years , i 've grieved the sudden loss of love , battled suicidal depression , went through ect and lost my memory , began drinking and quickly became an alcoholic , lost my job due to my illness , lived by the skin of my teeth on disability , and learned to navigate the world alone with a disabling illness there have been a lot of tears and triumphs , and i 've definitely changed up until today , i was certain the change was for the better i am a more compassionate , grateful person today honesty and integrity guide my actions that was n't always the case in the past but after seeing the b d photos today , i'm not as certain the change was for the best something seems to be missing ultimately , it was a tough day the memories piled so high , i eventually crumbled under their weight i was already crying when i came upon the last box it contained cards from my ex and wedding stuff that box has gotten smaller and smaller over the years , and today i was able to let it go it took a short time , but it became clear it was the right thing to do my tears cleared , and i felt relief it was finally time , i guess as i sit here reflecting , i'm looking forward to emptying my house in a couple days maybe lightening my house of it 's memory laden load will also lighten my eyes maybe not , i do n't know it was an interesting day , a long day , a difficult day , and a day i 'll eventually forget and that 's okay these memories were okay to visit , but dwelling on them is not in my plans i 'll keep putting one foot in front of the other i know that light is out there somewhere , and eventually i plan to catch it
