i 've heard really good things about apple 's new upgrade to osx leopard a colleague showed me some of its new features recently thanks , harry but another colleague no , it was n't louise told me he got it , then uninstalled it and went back to as he was dissatisfied with it i have n't yet learned the specifics of his disgruntlement , but i thought i 'd put this out to our mac readers to hear about any of their experiences oh , sorry about the reduced postings from me of late , and the delay of our new and improved sound podcast as you all know , life gets in the way sometimes funny expression like rl is secondary to online , and the past two weeks for me have been particularly packed with things i expect this to continue for a bit , but at a reduced pace , and will strive to keep contributing so , what does this have to do with psychiatry ? umm , a leopard can sometimes change his spots and become a tiger ? or change is not for everyone or macs are the preferred computers by maryland psychiatrists nudge , nudge , dinah
