anxiety is a modern term that does not have an exact equivalent in chinese medicine there is no chinese medicine term that corresponds exactly to what we call anxiety but several ancient chinese disease entities closely resemble anxiety the four main disease entities that correspond to anxiety are fear and palpitations jing ji panic throbbing zheng chong mental restlessness fan zao agitation zang zao fear is the emotion that pertains to the kidneys and i would like to make three points firstly , anxiety does not correspond only to fear it also corresponds to worry and pensiveness in chinese medicine secondly , we normally say that fear depletes kidney qi and it makes qi descend the su wen in chapter says fear leads to loss of jing which results in obstruction of the upper burner , when this is obstructed qi cannot return to it and this causes distension of the lower burner , that is why it is said that qi sinks this statement from the su wen is interesting in that it says that fear blocks the upper burner resulting in qi of the lower burner to descend this would imply that fear does not simply make qi descend as we usually say but that it also causes some qi stagnation in the upper burner i personally think that fear actually makes qi rise and fright makes qi descend the description of jing ji by zhang jing yue implies that , in fear , qi rises in fear and palpitations jing ji , the heart , spleen , liver and kidneys are involved yang is connected to yin and the heart to the kidneys in this disease the upper part of the body is restless because it cannot link with the lower part heart qi is deficient and cannot connect with the jing of the kidneys dr zhang s description of the pathology of zheng chong also implies that fear makes qi rise in panic throbbing zheng chong the heart is shaking in the chest , the patient feels fear and anxiety there is yin deficiency and exhaustion there is yin deficiency below so that the zong qi has no root and qi cannot return to its origin for this reason , there is shaking or throbbing of the chest above and also throbbing on the sides of the umbilicus the above statements by zhang jing yue are interesting because they confirm my experience according to which fear makes qi rise rather than descend in fact , in the statement above , zhang jing yue says that in fear and palpitations , there is restlessness above and a disconnection between the heart and kidneys with qi rising thirdly , although fear is the emotion pertaining to the kidneys , other organs also give rise to fear and anxiety and i am presenting below passages from the su wen and ling shu highlighting connections between fear and organs other than the kidneys su wen chapter fear leads to loss of jing which then results in obstruction of the upper burner , consequently leading to return back up of qi and distension in the lower burner this passage is actually similar to the passages by zhang jing yue quoted above it makes the point that fear leads to obstruction of the upper burner it confirms the relationship between fear and kidneys as it says that it leads to loss of jing the yellow emperor 's classic of

of blood results in fear this passage correlates fear with the liver saying that liver blood deficiency results in fear this is an important correlation as it is a common one in practice , especially in women in whom liver blood deficiency is common the fear deriving from liver blood deficiency is related to timidity , lack of initiative , fear of acting , inferiority complex the yellow emperor 's classic of internal medicine simple questions huang di nei jing su wen , people 's health publishing house , beijing , first published ca bc , p su wen chapter excessive fear lead to subjugation of the kidneys by spleen qi this is an interesting and unusual view according to which fear leading to a deficiency of the kidneys may be caused by a pathology of the spleen earth overcoming water this would occur when the spleen is affected by pensiveness and worry this type of fear therefore is close to worry the yellow emperor 's classic of internal medicine simple questions huang di nei jing su wen , people 's health publishing house , beijing , first published ca bc , p su wen chapter the disorder of heart qi causes belching the disorder of lung qi causes cough the disorder of liver qi causes excessive talking the disorder of spleen qi causes acid reflux the disorder of kidney qi causes yawning and sneezing the disorder of stomach qi causes rebellious qi , hiccup and fear note by wang bing when the stomach is hot , the qi of the kidneys is feeble and weak hence this causes fear when the earth harms the kidneys , the shen has fear this is an interesting passage that relates fear to rebellious stomach qi i think this would be particularly panic disorder panic attacks the great luo of the stomach called xu li goes to the heart and it affects it on a physical and mental emotional level on a physical level , it may cause palpitations or tachycardia on a mental emotional level , it may cause a panic sensation with a feeling of energy rising to the chest and head st fenglong would be the point to use for this the yellow emperor 's classic of internal medicine simple questions huang di nei jing su wen , people 's health publishing house , beijing , first published

shen and damage of the shen in turn will lead to fear and seminal emissions excessive fear and fright will scatter the shen and make it difficult to be contained to be gathered excessive fear and pensiveness will damage the shen damage of the shen in turn will lead to deprivation of the ability to control oneself due to fear constant fear without relief will damage the jing and damage of the jing will cause weakness of bones , impotence and habitual seminal emissions the first sentence of this passages relates fear to a deficiency of liver qi chapter of the su wen related it to liver blood deficiency liver qi deficiency does exist and it usually causes depression therefore , in this case , the person would be anxious and depressed the further sentences of this chapter say that fear damages the shen and the jing and therefore kidneys the yellow emperor s classic of internal medicine spiritual axis ling shu jing , people 's health publishing house , beijing , first published
