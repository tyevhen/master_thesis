i had a great day in new york today ! i cried , actually cried , when the starting line came into view for the first time after the start i kept my head up and my eyes open i looked around , paid special attention to each neighborhood we ran through , enjoyed every moment , and ran well to boot ! i finished in it was tough to run with a consistent or quick pace through the first miles , as the streets were quite crowded as a result , i ran a massive negative split , meaning i ran the second half faster than the first i ran through miles , which equates to a finish time for the full it 's every marathoner 's goal to run a negative split , but i did n't have such expectations today , which made the surprise negative split even more fun ! at mile , after coming off the very long , very uphill , queensboro bridge my slowest mile of the entire day , i realized i was feeling good so i went for it i felt good and ran well through mile , at which point i was certain i was going to finish and shed a few more tears from that point forward i hung on for the ride the last miles were tough but powerful , i maintained my pace , passed a lot of runners , and shed more than a few tears at the finish line i do n't remember if i 've ever before cried at a marathon i was truly overcome with emotion today , and that was totally okay i deserved it it 's been a long haul getting back here so i cried but i also smiled more , waved more , said thank you more to volunteers , military and police officers , and generally enjoyed myself more today than i have at previous marathons it was a good day
