i apologize for the lack of posts while away on my vacation with d , but time flew by i'm now back home d and i had a very nice time we spent time on and in the water , time playing with jet , time cooking wonderful meals , time running together , and time relaxing quietly in the house it was difficult to leave today it seems to be getting harder and harder to separate after spending time together life sure would be simpler if we lived near each other we made time for running while we were together a couple of days ago we ran a beautiful miler on a bike trail through the woods in fact , it was the very trail on which we met four years ago i always enjoy running and biking on that trail as we did a couple days ago , d and i usually end up reminiscing about our chance meeting when we 're on the trail it 's really quite amazing we met there , in the woods , five and a half hours from my house and four hours from his perhaps it was meant to be work resumes tomorrow things continue to go well there i'm actually looking forward to checking in with my patients i'm anxious to see how much they 've improved hopefully while i was gone it will be good to get back to life maybe jumping back into things will help me miss d less i hope so , because right now i'm missing him a bunch
