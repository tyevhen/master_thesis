jet and i had a great run this morning i was scheduled for an miler my busy day dictated that i run early this morning unfortunately , it was gray and degrees with a light mist , so i was n't too enthusiastic when i stepped outside my enthusiasm waned even more when the sky opened , and it began to pour just as i passed one mile it was a cold , hard rain with occasional rumbles of thunder , which jet really did n't appreciate rather than turn around and go home , after all i was already wet , i decided i 'd at least run a few miles and finish on the treadmill later but the cold , hard rain slowed to a sprinkle at my turn around point , mile two , so i decided to go ahead and finish my miles before we hit mile three , the sky opened again it poured and poured and poured more cold , hard rain i was far from home , so i decided i might as well continue it was absolutely silly , so silly i began to laugh jet and i were alone in the city stomping through the rain i'm sure people driving by questioned my sanity and maybe even wanted to rescue my adorably soaked dog but instead of feeling sorry for myself , i enjoyed myself it was fun ! we ran through the downpour for over an hour i was energized and ready for my day by the time we got home it turned out to be a great run i like when i have unexpected experiences like that it adds a little spice to my life the day has remained cold , wet and gray , but i'm still feeling energized my run in the rain really set the tone for the rest of my day ! the rest of my day has been filled with appointments , errands and a speaking engagement i told my story to a group of students at the local college as usual , i appreciated the opportunity to share my experience with depression i'm not sure my story is all that interesting , but at least it 's a first hand account of living with this sometimes debilitating illness i think that 's helpful for anyone learning about mental illness and as is usual after i speak , i end up feeling full of gratitude for the experience it 's been a good day
