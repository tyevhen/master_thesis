since i last posted here , i have read and appreciated all of your comments it is so helpful to know i am not as abnormal as i feared and i'm doing better my thoughts have settled , and today they were actually pretty good thank you again for all of your helpful feedback ! i actually had a lot of practice controlling my thoughts today , as i ran a race my brain is notoriously noisy during races , especially longer ones today 's race was eleven miles on a paved trail despite the pouring rain prior to the start , there was a pretty good turnout i did n't know what kind of performance to expect i 've been working really hard on my speed work and tempo runs , so i hoped for a decent time , but i was n't sure if i had done enough work yet for any kind of payoff today it was a good test race for me at this point in my training i started fast but controlled i knew it would be a tough race mentally , as it is an out and back course through the woods this morning it was just me and my thoughts not knowing what kind of shape i was in , i did n't know if i had gone out too fast , too slow , or just right my brain , of course , took advantage of my questioning and bombarded me with negative thoughts i ignored them as best i could and settled in after miles i was still feeling pretty good there was another woman in the distance in front of me , and i slowly reeled her in i had about a ten second lead on her at the turn around i also knew i was in th place overall among the women with no chance of catching the top three , i concentrated on putting more distance between me and the woman in fifth i was getting tired i did n't know if i could hold my pace the negative thinking reared its ugly head again , but i fought back between miles and i came up with a mantra to drown out the negativity i'm stronger i'm getting stronger the more tired i got , the more ferociously i thought it worked mile was my fastest mile of the entire race ! those last three miles were tough , but i never let up in the end , i put over three minutes between me and the woman in fifth i finished in th place overall , and i finished first in my age division it was a good test and an enjoyable race i think the timing of this challenging race could n't have been better historically , as it was again today , i 've been able to overcome negative thinking when i race if i can overcome when i race , there 's no reason to think i ca n't overcome at other times if my broken thinking shows up again in the next few days , i should be able to recall today 's mental effort with some confidence once again running has given me a tool for living my life i love that
