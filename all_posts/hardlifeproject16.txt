today i celebrated months clean sober of course , that 's a relative term because my celebrating is sitting here snorting ritalin , the very thing i have n't done since june , yes , that right as i'm sitting here typing this right now , i'm relapsing i have lines cut right here in front of me , and i'm snorting them up and feeling no pain that 'll come later why would anyone do this who 's worked so hard to stay clean for the better part of a year ? good question the answer for me is a combination of pressure and trauma
