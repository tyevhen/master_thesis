i know of a number of things that would break the depression spiral that i spend most days slipping down i could go outside and take a walk i could read there are certain books the invariably lift my spirit leaves of grass , catch , the world of pooh , roughing it i could go to a local coffee shop that always makes me feel better i could write another entry in this blog but all of those things take effort it s so much easier to pour another bourbon and watch law order reruns it doesn t make me feel better , necessarily , but at least it makes me feel less well , i m going to try to blog with greater regularity unlike previous blog entries my writing henceforth will be less thought out i m making it a personal goal to write something for this blog everyday this may get messy
