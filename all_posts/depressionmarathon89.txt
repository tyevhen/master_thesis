today is one of those days i feel like i should write here it 's been almost a week since i last wrote , and i feel an obligation to update my blog unfortunately , i do n't have much to say things are going well i'm working , running , and taking care of my house , although that 's still last on my priority list there 's nothing new or interesting to say , which does n't make for compelling reading i'm sorry about that but i guess this is part of living with depression , too normalcy my symptoms remain at bay i'm not too high nor too low i'm okay i'm living this is what i mean when i say i'm living with , rather than suffering from depression i still have depression , but it does n't have me i know it 's there , but depression is not controlling my life right now i am and i'm grateful for that i realize i'm in the midst of a lengthy streak of feeling okay when i have these streaks of wellness , i sometimes feel bad when it comes to this blog i worry i do n't have much to offer you , my readers but maybe continuing to live well , feel well , and move forward is actually helpful , too ? i do n't know but that 's all i 've got today i'm well i'm just well
