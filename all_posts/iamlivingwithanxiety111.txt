yesterday i was talking with someone who has ocd fairly severely what i found particularly interesting about this conversation is that she easily could see through my anxieties and fears to a more rationale , less anxiety clouded future in the same way , i saw through her rituals and behaviors and could point out their disconnect to reality anxiety and fear warp our minds we lose perspective of what 's real , what could happen , and what actually will happen i am very fearful of the future , but i'm trying to find ways to embrace a more positive and optimistic outlook that 's hard to do in this economy , so step one might be limiting my access to the news of course bad news sells i spend a lot of time reading the news not because of anxiety , but because i am a news junkie , but maybe i 'll focus a little more on myself and my wellness next year hmm , time to start thinking about those new year 's resolutions !
