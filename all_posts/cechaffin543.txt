unbelievable after increasing my zyprexa dose for two nights i feel better , though certainly not out of the woods i did n't weep yesterday i'm having trouble getting to sleep , however , because the drug makes my legs twitch , not to mention that i increased the wellbutrin dose as well i'm maxed out on my meds , and if they do n't work , i 'll have to drive four hours down to san francisco to see a good psychopharmacologist i do n't want to say anymore about my kilorat wattage for fear of jinxing myself instead i 'll share a joke i heard on dr demento it was told in the first person so i 'll try to do it justice from memory , full well knowing that a written joke is never as funny as a spoken one it might be better to read this aloud to a friend back in alaska , working for the railroad , i was a gandy dancer you know what that is ? we had these long handled shovels , irish banjos , and we 'd stick 'em under the railroad ties or rails and then bounce on the handle end to raise the tracks , so the other workers could shove gravel and dirt under the ties anyway , that time passed and now they 'd send three cars to work on a stretch of track a bunk car , a tool car , and a kitchen car but the company never sent a cook so what happened , and i was a newbie , was that whoever complained about the cooking would have to become the cook until someone else complained not knowing the ropes i was naturally appointed cookd now i hate to cook so i bethought myself how to get out of this responsibility i was walking out in the woods when i saw a huge moose turd , i mean really big so i rolled that puppy back to the kitchen car and decided to make a pie out of it someone was bound to complain i covered a big pastry pan with dough , pinched it , put in the moose turd , covered it with fancy strips and a little mint on top and shoved it in the oven when it came out it was a thing of beauty i set it down on the table for the hands big jack came in and sat down , he was a mountain of a man immediately he dug in to the pie a strange look passed across his face and i thought he was going to wallop me but after swallowing the first bite , he said , moose turd pie ! not bad thine in hope and haute cuisine , ce
