last night , sitting at my desk like i always do , a surprising and unfamiliar sense of relief suddenly washed over me it wasn t like a thunderbolt , but like the slow lifting of a veil this pall of pain that hangs over me like a cloud all the time was vanishing into thin air i felt an exhilarating sense of release , of relaxation a calm invaded my body and i wasn t quite sure why it was so different from the chronic aches and pains i live with much of the time in contrast to the routine , relentless misery , this welcome calm felt like euphoria the moment reminded me of that night years ago when i was just as suddenly plunged into a crater of panic and anxiety , without knowing why one moment , i m sitting in my berkeley apartment calmly reading a book , a sophomore without a care in the world the next , a pit opens in my stomach and i m being engulfed by a fear and dread that came out of nowhere i got up , went to the bathroom , splashed water on my face i went to the kitchen and manically did the dishes but it wouldn t stop i thought if i went to sleep it would finally go away , so i clutched the pillow and shut my eyes tight , praying for this inner monster to disappear , but when i woke up it was still there i ve been trying to find the cause and the cure ever since only primal therapy ever gave me any answers and any respite but primal therapy only works if you stay with it i ve had big breakthroughs over the years clouds part , angels sing and you really feel reborn but the pain comes back and you have to keep muddling through my problem is that i m a big avoider if my terror is kept under wraps and my pain at an endurable , dull constant , that s good enough i focused on my work , my family , my whatever so literally years would go by without therapy , without feeling eventually , it caught up with me , slowly dragged me into a mental and physical morass i could no longer brush it off saying i m fine for now i was feeling horrible there were times when my whole being felt anguished i d be just sitting in my house and feel this pain in every pore like a wretch , i wanted to be put out of my misery how could i be feeling so miserable when my life was going relatively well ? my body carries all my pain the tension grabs my stomach like a vice , penetrates to my bones there are times when i m just one big aching organism i even feel at times like there 's acid in my veins maybe that s why i was so transfixed by the images of christ on the cross as a kid i was not aware then that i was hurting , but i was mesmerized by the symbols of suffering , of pure agony , of despair in the face of so much pain i now see that was me for a year , i ve been getting regular sessions again at the primal center in santa monica it s the fourth time i ve been back for therapy since i started in every two weeks , chipping away at the things that hurt me , in the present and the past luckily , i cry easily and almost from the first deep primal , i started feeling that little bit of relief , enough to keep me going but then came last night this was a feeling of total well being that swelled up in me oh my god , there was no aching muscles , no throbbing forehead , no clenched abdomen i didn t feel any of those symptoms of suffering i ve learned to live with instead , i felt i felt good ! there was almost a pleasant buzz in the pit of my stomach where that old panic used to be that acid in my veins turned into a rush of warmth flowing through me i didn t just feel relieved i felt free hallelujah there is an end to this misery at last the sliding door to my office was open outside , a warm santa ana wind was rustling the tall palm tree overhead it felt like a caress from nature , like a good wind blowing down the canyon i was at the computer and i had to stop what i was doing , the chore of paying monthly bills as it happens , i was on the phone with my bank , trying to resolve a problem with their website the agent had put me on hold and i had put down the phone with the loudspeaker on , and they had classical music playing during the wait that piano sounded so soothing , so completely attuned to my mood at the moment it reminded me of the music my mom played at night as she fell asleep , the radio always on her nightstand and i just closed my eyes and listened and floated away on that reverie the breeze , the piano , the inner peace i felt serene , liberated for that moment , i was just there what is strange is that the payoff came today i had gone for a session earlier that morning , but nothing big had happened the feelings were not so strong , not so deep it was more like wrapping up lose ends from two weeks ago , when i had plunged into big feelings about being molested by a relative at age , the age my son is now the uncle who did this had been very nice to me , showing all the interest , praise and affection that i had never received from my dad he let me put shaving cream on his face and i still remember his stubble bristling on my hand because i had never touched a man s beard before he let me sit at the head of the table and asked me all about myself and what i wanted for dinner and made me feel special , like no other man ever had he held me in his arms as we fell asleep , and i was in heaven because i had never been held by a man like that before so when he twisted our closeness into something bad , something so selfish , i felt crushed not back then , mind you back then , it was never discussed it was a secret that i buried down deep i always knew it was there what i didn t know was how deeply it hurt that pain was buried too but now , in reliving it , i understood the meaning of that abuse for me it meant the little love i had found was a fraud it meant i would never find pure love i would never be loved just for me so in that follow up session , i cried more about that about how sad it was to come to the end of my emotionally empty and lonesome childhood to have my hopes raised , then betrayed i cried thinking about my dad , seeing him at his usual place at the kitchen table , wanting to go to him with my secret but not actually having to tell him i just wanted him to understand , to see my need and my hurt i wanted to ask him to hold me , like a son just put his arm around me and protect me if i didn t need him so much , maybe this would not have happened i left feeling almost as sad as i came in so eight hours later , when that veil of pain lifted , it was like a delayed pay off i see it as the cumulative benefit of consistently dipping into my personal hurt locker i was just so backed up and overloaded , i needed to drain it down the next morning i had to get up early to take my son to chorus practice at i didn t sleep much , but i didn t feel as lousy as i usually do in the morning , especially when i m sleep deprived in fact , i was cheerful , laughing with my son over some jokes on the tv and moving more quickly without coffee after dropping him off , i went for a walk , salsa music playing on my earphones i felt so different , physically , than i usually do before , every step was a burden my muscles hurt by just stepping up on a curb i felt like i was loaded down , heavy , always pushing against some force but this day , my step was light i walked briskly for three miles and did n't feel all that inner sludge weighing me down i actually skipped up onto curbs when i mentioned this milestone of progress in an email to art janov , he suggested i write something for the blog patients get discouraged , he said , and this could help them stay motivated that s the key primal therapy requires stick to it iveness , but it s easy to get bogged down and give up that was even part of my feeling this wo n't stop nothing works to make it better art is wrong his critics are right primal is dangerous i need a doctor to give me painkillers and get it over with it s all too much , too scary when the relief finally came , dr janov looked like a genius coincidentally , when i got home and checked facebook , the following quote from the philosopher rainer maria rilke came across my newsfeed wow , i hadn t thought of him for a long , long while but when i was in college , at the depths of my breakdown and the peak of my insanity , i somehow found comfort reading him back then , it was just his lyrical prose , his uplifting spirituality that lulled my freaked out nerves , plus a kindness and wisdom i perceived in him now that primal has released my potential for enjoying life , his words have a real meaning i confess that i consider life to be a thing of the most untouchable deliciousness , and that even the confluence of so many disasters and deprivations , the exposure of countless fates , everything that insurmountably increased for us over the past few years to become a still rising terror , cannot distract me from the fullness and goodness of existence that is inclined toward us rainer maria
