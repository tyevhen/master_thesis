photo courtesy of here god , give me grace to accept with serenity the things that cannot be changed , courage to change the things which should be changed , and the wisdom to distinguish the one from the other living one day at a time , enjoying one moment at a time , accepting hardship as a pathway to peace , taking , as jesus did , this sinful world as it is , not as i would have it , trusting that you will make all things right , if i surrender to your will , so that i may be reasonably happy in this life , and supremely happy with you forever in the next amen by reinhold niebuhr
