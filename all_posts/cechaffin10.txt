for no obvious reason i could determine , i popped out of my nine month suicidal depression for a little over two weeks , but they ended precipitously on october , curiously the anniversary date of kathleen leaving me when i was manic i was lying on the couch listening to her singing as she cooked then i thought , what if i were to lose her ? then without warning , though i tried to hold on , i felt myself spiraling back to oblivion where i have been since , an oblivion worse for having tasted normality ever so briefly this is a puzzling disease i was myself for two weeks , then suddenly i am not lost again in the morass of unendurable self annihilating miasma , back to suicidal thoughts , complete disorganization of the mind , the horrors , the inability to make a decision , lack of interest in all things , terrified of everything and nothing nothing really changed except my mood , but i must have been extremely vulnerable , and i do n't know if the anniversary reaction helped trigger it or not now i am toughing it out again , have gone back on antipsychotics for survival 's sake , and today , thank god , i was a little less worse than yesterday back to kilorats , ce
