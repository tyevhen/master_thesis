patients have been talking about a tv show i 'd never heard of clean house it 's a reality tv show where they come in and help the clutter bugs get rid of their stuff i 've never watched it obviously this is entertainment ? my patients say they watch it then go throw some of their stuff out entertaining and therapeutic it 's funny as in kind of ironic , not ha ha , but people spend a lot of time in therapy talking about their clutter and the piles of paper they ca n't part with i suggest bonfires , but hey so i started thinking about this whole reality tv show concept , and the fact that i'm writing about psychotherapy now done with words of what is psychotherapy i had this fantasy about having a real life therapy podcast roy once talked about how there was bound to be a reality therapy tv show could n't i do a start to finish psychotherapy podcast and put it on itunes ? i 've got the microphones , and i could probably get roy to teach me how to use all these gadgets it might be interesting , it might be something people could use to teach gosh , that therapist says dumb things ! or it could be really boring how does one logistically recruit a patient for such thing ? is it ethical hmmm to offer free psychotherapy in exchange for allowing it to be broadcast on the internet ? could anyone relax and be themselves ? what if it got up close and personal and the patient wanted out ? obviously , you stop , but then what becomes of the therapy ? funny , they did n't deal with these issues in medical school okay , it 's not happening it was just a fantasy i'm going to clean out my closet now for real
