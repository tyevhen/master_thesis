i confess i'm not being a good patient i'm so damn bored , i ca n't help it ! it 's just me , and jet , and four walls for of every day it feels like my house is closing in on me i try to find reasons to go out , but when you 're not allowed to do anything and have no money to spend there are n't a lot of places to go i'm really having a difficult time with all of this excess time so i confess , i 've been a bad girl i 've been a bad girl , and unfortunately i think i'm paying for it i began doing exercises for my weak left leg last week those went well , no ill effects , so i added some gentle peddling on my stationary recumbent bike just minutes , gently , and that went well , too i was walking half a block several times per day , as instructed , so i added a few sessions on the alter g , anti gravity treadmill i walked at only of my body weight , not too strenuous , and that felt really good i was actually able to walk , to stretch my legs , for whole minutes ! i think that was fine , but the back strengthening exercises i added a couple of days ago , i think those were ill advised that 's where i might have overdone it do n't tell my surgeon , but i think those back exercises have caused an increase in my left low back pain i was n't having any back pain , just left leg and foot pain , prior to the exercises now my back hurts again i think i overdid it i spoke with the surgeon 's nurse today regarding another issue , and she reiterated my movement restrictions she said something like , the doctor does n't want you to do anything more than short walks your back muscles , the area around your spine , and the nerve all need time to heal oops bad patient i guess the surgeon does know best it seems i 've set myself back a bit so despite being bored out of my mind , i guess i 'll sit on my duff for of the next few days ugh ! at least the tour de france is on television , and i love to watch le tour , but that only covers me for a few hours i should try to read a book , but i'm just not into it it 's strange , i know i love to write , but i'm not a big book reader short attention span , i guess tomorrow i 've got vacuuming and picking up dog doo to look forward to , and truthfully , i'm probably not allowed to do either of those activities either but some things have to be done i promise , doc , i wo n't do anything else ! really i do n't want to set myself back any further boredom , i guess , is here to stay
