ha ! i say hahahahahahaha this is what our therapist told me this evening again ha as with many many mommies out there , my me time is therapy , or driving there or better yet the dentist ! how many of us have fallen asleep in the dentist 's chair and i mean without sedation ? i had a run scheduled today really i did however , nate 's bus was stuck in traffic and could n't get to him this morning , so after jack 's bus picked him up at i had to drive nate to school and get him there by at least miles away during rush hour did i mention that i have never dropped nate off at his new school before ? if you were there this morning i was that idiot mom that pulled into the bus area yes that was me every elementary school has a very strict drop off procedure , and just to keep it interesting each one is very very different after having my boys in elementary schools already , believe me , i am aware this , however , did not prevent me from making a complete a of myself so idiot mommy had to back down the bus lane and pull in the correct way , only to be told that eci kids have to be walked in when they are driven awesome so i pulled through that lane and parked , and took nate to his class , and had a minute conversation with his teacher and pulled nate off my leg the victory he did n't cry when i left so i guess the frantic drive home or as i prefer to think of it to work was my me time today today was the only normal day this week aka no run i think it 's bed time hey maybe that can be my me time
