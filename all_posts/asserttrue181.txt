a while back , i promised i would share the fugly hack i'm using to scrape twitter profile pics as live links to use at the bottom of each blog post scroll to the bottom to see what i mean the code ai n't pretty , but it works and it 's fast you do n't have to know javascript to use the code in firefox , open a scratchpad window shift f or in chrome do control shift j to get a console window be sure your active browser tab is the twitter notifications timeline view paste the code below into the scratchpad window in firefox , do control l to run the code results show up in the scratchpad itself in chrome , hit enter return you should get a dump of a lot of raw html copy and paste that into your web page good luck getting wordpress to display it the way you want ! but at least you now have the raw html you may have to scroll sideways to see all the code the code was formatted using http hilite me you want all classes stream item content clearfix stream item activity stream item retweet stream item activity me you want all a nodes within that function getrters var tclass 'stream item content clearfix stream item activity stream item retweet stream item activity me' var cl document getelementsbyclassnametclass var r for caching the hits var lut for unduping the hits for var i i cl length i var item cl i var a item getelementsbytagname'a' if ! a throw there is no spoon dig all links out for var j j a length j var hasimg a j getelementsbytagname'img' no avatars ? just move on if ! hasimg hasimg length continue need to ensure expanded url , not relative url var username a j href tostring a j setattribute'title' , username a j setattribute'href' , username var result a j outerhtml if username in lut undupe continue lut username mark as visited r pushresult save the markup return r return the hits now use the function var r getrters r join' n' ' n' r length displays in console the code relies on the fact that the retweet nodes are contained in a special class with a big huge long name how did i figure out the huge name ? i used firefox 's inspect element right click on any part of any web page and choose inspect element from the popup menu not much else to explain here , really i do go to the trouble of unduplicating the links for that , i use a lookup table although i'm not using it to look anything up var lut new object aka lookup table in javascript , an object is just a hashed list , which you can think of as an array that uses text to index into the array instead of a number of course , under the covers it 's all numbers , but that 's not our concern you can do lut whatever text you want and the number one gets associated with the index string whatever text you want there 's no magic to the number one , in the above code i have to use something to mark the index as taken it could just as well have been 'true' or zero or math pi , or whatever when you 're done , in any case , you get the html markup that produces this lovely mosaic and those are the wonderful people who retweeted me yesterday i want to thank each and every person shown above please follow these great people they retweet ! have you joined the mailing list ? what are you waiting for ?
