while i realize training , per se , is not relevant to the germanwings crash , as a pilot i find it odd to say the least that lufthansa would hire someone to copilot an airbus on the basis of hours of flight experience i keep reading that andreas lubitz had hours was that his total time at the time of the crash , or at the time of his hiring in ? most airline pilots fly hours a month or more if lubitz was on the job for over a year , he should have accumulated flight hours just in the past year if most of his hours were obtained since his hiring , it means he was hired with very little flight time lufthansa trains many of its pilots in arizona , in beech bonanza aircraft a high performance single engine , piston powered airplane i suspect many of lubitz 's hours were in this kind of aircraft i doubt he had more than hours of jet time as a side note i have a couple hundred hours of pic time in an ex lufthansa bonanza that my father bought years ago it 's a great plane it 's no airbus , though a lufthansa bonanza in arizona and again , no amount of flight experience is relevant if you are intent on killing people but i think it 's fair to ask why lufthansa germanwings would hire someone with so little experience and entrust him with an airbus full of people in the u s , an airline transport rating requires hours of flight time with a fresh atp license , most pilots are unable to find work at a major carrier if they do , it 's in a commuter airline cockpit many fresh atps in the u s are overjoyed to find work with a cargo carrier no one expects to get a front office job with a major airline with less than hours i guess they do things differently in europe the germanwings accident would have been much less likely years ago for the simple reason that back then , most cockpits had three person crews since that time , cockpit ergonomics have improved to the point where it is feasible not to mention economical to have a two person crew but now the question is do we want that , really ? many questions will come out of the germanwings disaster let 's hope many good answers will follow have you checked out my free book mental health myths debunked ? tons of info , tons of live links , lots of straight talk about depression , meds , therapy , psychiatry , mental health trends , statistics , and more and you know me , i call bullshit on bogus ideas then give urls to the actual data you can download the book epub or pdf at noisetrade do it now while it 's free hey listen , the following list of people who retweeted me yesterday might not be complete , but it 's as good as i can do with my silly notifications scraping hack in any case , you should get busy following the folks shown below they 're fantastic twitter networkers , and they retweet ! click their pictures the pics are live links have you added your name to our mailing list ? what the heck are you waiting for , a personal invitation from thetweetofgod ? also please visit hackyourdepression com when you have a chance , and share that link with someone you know who might be suffering from anxiety or depression
