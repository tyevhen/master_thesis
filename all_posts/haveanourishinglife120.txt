click here my point of showing all these images is to make you aware that we are bombarded with extreme body image negativity we see it so much , everyday , every time we 're on the computer , every time we look at a magazine we are de sensitized to it it s a part of our culture now but we don t have to put up with it we must seek to rid our lives of this poison i am sorry to be dramatic look at it this way the enemy wants us to hate ourselves if you do not love your body and do not treat it with respect , then you will be more likely tempted to sin if you have no self respect and no boundaries , then the enemy can convince you it doesn t matter , when it does , tremendously your body image is important don t let the enemy win the battle that easily
