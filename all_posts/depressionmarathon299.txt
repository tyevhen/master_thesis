i do n't know if you remember me , but i certainly have n't forgotten you i tend not to forget people who have made a huge , positive impact on my life you were one of the first you tended to my psychological needs for years , from the time we first met , which was after my first suicide attempt landed me in the your inpatient , adolescent , mental health unit , through the end of my college years , when i picked up and moved away even after that time , i returned when i could and stopped in to say hello i always wanted you to know , needed you to know , i was doing well kathy , you were such a big part of my earliest healing from this nasty illness of depression when i needed a steady , loving presence , you were there you were patient , and kind , and caring you were generous with your time and spirit as i grew , and the depression resolved , i kept in touch because i wanted to show you what all your work had done for me despite my challenges throughout childhood and adolescence , i was well depression had n't beaten me , and much of the credit for that goes to you thirteen years ago , the depression returned , and i lost touch my journey changed direction more than once life got complicated for awhile , i got lost in a bottle job loss , hospitalizations , financial strain mental illness reigned supreme i struggled , alternating periods of wellness with stretches of devastation i love rollercoasters , but this one was no fun during those difficult years , i 'd return to duluth , wander past your hospital or drive by your home and think , i should stop in , but i did n't for some reason , i did n't want you to know things were tough i ca n't explain why but i missed keeping in touch i never forgot your impact on my life i continue to want to thank you , over and over again and it 's been too long , kathy , since i 've checked in , and i hope it 's not too late with great trepidation , i tried to call , but a thirteen year old number only rang without end i was almost relieved after all , what would i say ? too many years have passed you may not even know who i am yet i want you to know , kathy , that when i'm here in duluth , as i am practically every year at marathon time , i always think of you and i think of you with tremendous gratitude in my heart , for you saved me when i wanted to jump again and again and again , you were there today i am sober and living with , rather than suffering from , depression many impactful people have passed through my life , and my gratitude extends to all of them but i would n't be here today without you , kathy thank you
