i received the below response from my oldest daughter after the post yesterday about my odd habit of memorizing poetry it 's only odd , i think , in the present day culture where , most people are interested only in quickie tweets or facebook glances a little more than a hundred years ago all american public school report cards included a grade for declamation i have bought several old copies of gray 's elegy written in a country churchyard which had been inscribed to some child as a reward for his excellence in declamation or a merry christmas from some aunt or uncle i 'll bet no public school child today even knows the meaning of the word declamation and what aunt or uncle today would consider a poetry book suitable as a gift to a child ? they too often settle for gift cards as presents it 's too bad they took all the old nursery rhymes out of the school system as being too violent are they kidding ? when they have whole schools read hunger games and teenage books about rape and incest these are not called violent they are praised as realistic , real issues , and down to earth issues the loss of poetry is too bad poetry helps to organize the neurons of the brain toward logical reasoning in the same way that classical music does sadly there is not much classical music around , either nursery rhymes and elementary rhythm bands were wonderful for childhood brain development i hope i'm not the only one who thinks this is a deplorable situation for without lofty and inspiring thoughts to buoy us up when we feel low , what people are now sinking into is an artificial drug high of some kind to lift their spirits unfortunately what these these people do n't realize is that there is ultimately a price to pay for introducing these uppers into the neurons of your brain becoming addicted to them is only one downside culture degradation is another would lincoln have written the gettysburg address if he spent all is time twittering and facebooking as a child ? first of all , he would n't have the vocabulary and you need some alone time to develop your soul anyway , here is the encouraging letter i received from one of my daughters she remembered another shakespeare phrase i used all the time dear mom , and do n't forget the oft used how sharper than a serpent 's tooth it is , to have a thankless child i have dutifully passed that one down to the next generation ! love , demming
