i recently bought a new poet 's market , an intimidating book printed on cheap paper of pp in it is an interview with a successful poet , who does seminars and readings a year , up to if he has a new book or album out he edits a literary magazine and is also a songwriter he estimates that americans may make some living through poetry , which sounds like a lot to me obviously this man works hard yet in researching him on the net he had only of the references i do on google apparently he has not published extensively online then i checked his latest book from it ranks below , , titles on amazon my new book ranks just above , , for comparison , rendering them likely equally obscure i also did not recognize his name from the article t s eliot wrote there is no competition unfortunately , in this day and age of proliferating poets , eliot is wrong there is competition each poem published in a journal that rejects me is a potential place where i might have had success each reading booked up in advance in a major city is one reading i ca n't get although k f admits that the poetry world has proliferated beyond his imaginings , from open mikes to slams , the internet , etc , he has this to say about the art what has not changed is the nepotism of the biz and the preconceived notions of the academic sector most poets still teach to support themselves there is still no one who rushes home to tell his parents that he is a poet and then is subsequently swamped with congratulations and financial support we all know this poets are not pariahs , just largely irrelevant to the larger culture i have compared poetry to lawn bowling in this regard in past essays , a cultural vestigial organ yet if one is truly infected by poetry there is no cure i will go on writing and publishing until they take this computer from my cold dead hands yes , i want to be read yes , i would like more recognition yes , i have a new book to promote and eight interviews and eight reviews already but i assure you my book is not jumping off the shelves the most i 've sold at once is five at a local reading i also importuned my bank manager , dentist and my shrink and family doctor to buy copies after all , the monetary exchange for their services dwarfs a small purchase of my book i did recently receive encouragement from ireland , where a j patterson wrote me for my revised version of the essay on t s eliot 's four quartets no one to my knowledge ever finished that essay before i even had a standing reward of for the first person who did afterwards this good soul ordered a signed copy of unexpected light and gave me a good report i enjoyed the correspondence i enjoyed the fact that he felt my treatment of eliot was substantial and witty and fun to read i also know , from my research , that certain christian aspects of the poems were better elucidated in my essay than any others i could find in fact , everyone has given me a good report the reviews have been uniformly positive so where do i go from here ? more reviews , more interviews , more publications ? if this fellow is relatively famous and interviewed for poet 's market and his book ranks far below mine though at these numbers one or two purchases can shoot you back up the ignominious ladder of obscurity , and he has of my references on google , what should i say ? that i'm better known on the net ? i suspect he makes most of his dough leading seminars , that 's where the real money is for mid level poets , while the truly famous can command , or more for a single performance you know , collins , angelou and the rest the scale of celebrity among poets is more variable than the winners of american idol luck has much to do with it , but so does nepotism an mfa with a close connection to a well known poet professor has a much better chance at ascending the ladder than a disabled doctor with few connections that goes without saying , especially since this doctor only became serious about publishing in yet since then i 've published two books of poetry and edited one anthology while being included in many others i even recently had boundaries recognized as the best poem currently online for a week http bestnewpoemsonline wordpress com see may i have some obstacles to furthering my ambition , of course first , i live far away from metropolitan centers where venues abound second , i'm manic depressive and travel can really screw with my mood third , i loathe to be away from my true love , kathleen but paramount , above all these , is the program in my head forbidding self promotion my mother instilled in me very early not to blow my own horn , not to brag , to rather wait for my excellence to be recognized that 's the emily dickinson way that many poets cling to i 'll be noticed when i'm dead fat chance if you were n't noticed while alive to be noticed while alive can be arranged , however for the well heeled poet of unlimited means , an expensive new york publicist can be hired and she will get readings and reviews in that great hive considered the center of literature in these united states still , if the quality lacks , such a poet would be rejected by the academic community , and rightly so , but that will not stop them from out googling , out selling and out maneuvering others of greater talent i see many poets self publishing , even in their own magazines , and acting as if they have received recognition when they have essentially granted it to themselves i hate cold calling people i 've never met to ask for open reading dates on the pacific coast i'm not looking forward to the travel in my four dates coming up sf , sacramento , la , sd require , and only two of them look like first class venues but i will keep my word and show up , i hope , unless my energy fails but look at the downside again k f does up to a readings a year when a new book comes out and his amazon ranking is below mine and there 's also a strange feather in my hat my first book , elementary , is apparently rare enough now only copies were printed that it sells for on amazon , and only one copy is available so someone thinks my first book is valuable what does that mean ? i do n't know probably something to do with book collectors who hoard obscure poets this all boils down to one question for me is it worth the work ? if i knock my head against the world of poetry venues , will it result in anything of note sales , publicity , what ? some result , yes , a few books sold here and there , not enough to cover my gas , but in the main , it 's doubtful it is probably wiser to concentrate on breaking into the august publications like southern review and poetry so far i have n't broken that glass ceiling , though to be fair , at my best , i do not think myself the inferior to those i see in there , though i often admire the work and one wonders despite the blind reading claims of so many of these journals what would happen if my name were john ashbery or w s merwin or mark strand would n't these instantly be kicked upstairs by the powers that be ? i do not believe the editors are fair in this regard , whatever they claim nepotism by reputation and previous publication within a magazine still obtain if i were a purist it would be all about the work , the next poem , the next song , trying to achieve that artistic perfection or logos that all artists aspire to but i'm human , ah there 's the rub like any artist i crave recognition , yet my lutheran background tells me that ambition may be wrong , just as self promotion is wrong but that ca n't be right even jesus promoted himself by miracles and street preaching so perhaps it 's the protestant inheritance that drives me i ca n't have work without result ! i ca n't just write poetry for nothing for magazines that do n't pay and come with little recognition or can i ? further , jesus promoted himself for the benefit of mankind to what degree can i say my art does something of the same ? i know my manic depressive and love poems have helped some , but on a scale of good works which the new testament rejects wholesale i ca n't compare to a missionary distributing food and medicines or is my calling just different and just as important in its way ? so my wife would have me think i have been undiscriminating about my best work , sending it to whatever e zine suited my fancy at the time , or because of a submission call i could have parceled my work out slowly , attacking only the best magazines but initially i did n't have the self confidence to do so , and the thrill of being published anywhere superseded the thrill of submitting to poetry for ten years in hope against hope btw , i do send them regular submissions , they may even recognize my name from the amount of rejections i endure so what am i saying ? craig is confused plain confused he loves poetry , he likes to publish , he loves giving readings , but he wonders does he have the necessary drive to promote himself like k f ? and , is it worth it ? in discussing this with my wife and editor this morning , she suggested that the best scenario is to be taken under a well known poet 's wing and mentored along at i feel i am in the mentor stage i teach poetry online see my website for the course offering and every unpublished poet who has taken my course has been afterwards published , save one who did n't want to submit and likely was n't ready i'm a little old for applying for fellowships at major universities for poets , and the stipend would n't cover expenses anyway i do n't want to uproot myself from my beloved mendocino and go traipsing to the iowa writer 's workshop for instruction and connections in truth i 've only really been at this for twelve years , so perhaps , since i first published at roughly , i should think of myself as only in the serious poetry competition so i would still likely benefit from a mentor how do you get one ? i suppose the way you do everything else by endless queries cast your bread upon the waters and it shall return to you after many days but sometimes you only feed the ducks in a mixed state , between kilorats and kilobunny , ce
