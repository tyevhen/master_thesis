enterprise software tends to disappoint , on many levels the complaints are legion , but basically you 're lucky if a fairly elaborate software suite e g , an enterprise grade content management system can be installed by an ordinary human being not a vendor trained consultant in less than a day , and if you can do anything out of the ordinary without reading the documentation heaven help you if you actually need to implement clustering , do a complete backup of the system , or do anything at all non trivial , on your own i 'd like to present a fairly simple list of five questions you should ask yourself before deciding whether a particular vendor 's system is good , bad , or just plain ugly disclosure i work for adobe systems , and most of the following examples will use adobe 's digital marketing suite , in particular the adobe cq web content management part of it , as an example can you install a usable fully functional sandbox instance of the software easily , using one double clickable file ? adobe cq meets this test it comes as a double clickable jar file that explodes its contents into the complete install footprint needed to run a fully functional instance of the product , without presenting for example wizards that ask you for esoteric info or demanding that you put certain values in your operating system 's java path , etc the first time you run the cq installer , it takes anywhere from one to three minutes to lay down the contents of the system all subsequent starts of the system take only to seconds depending on the speed of your machine can you easily cluster the system by designating other running instances as cluster nodes using just a url ? adobe cq offers one simple dialog to enable this clustering takes seconds literally to set up anyone can do it you do n't have to be a systems architect , a programmer , or an ber admin adding a node to a cluster is as easy as specifying a url can you do a backup take a snapshot of the entire system , including all its artifacts , all user added content , all code , all everything by doing nothing more than hitting a button ? again , adobe cq enables this sort of functionality and you do n't have to be a skilled super user to do it want to take a snapshot of the system ? click a button can you develop custom components from within the system , using an integrated ui , without firing up some secondary development environment eclipse , visual c , etc ? adobe cq includes its own code editor a complete ide , actually with which to develop html , jsps , server side ecmascript , osgi bundles , and any other artifacts you might need in order to customize your system develop java classes with the integrated ide , hot deploy them as osgi bundles no bouncing the server can you deploy arbitrarily elaborate custom applications without taking the system down and starting it back up again ? adobe cq 's infrastructure is osgi based , which means you can hot deploy any number of java classes any time you want , without bouncing the system i know , i know , this sounds like one big giant ad for adobe cq , and it is but i 've worked in enterprise software for years and in that time , i 've evaluated scores of content management systems , and until now i 've never encountered a large software offering something of the scale of cq that could meet the challenges posed by the five questions listed above if you know of another example , by all means leave a comment below !
