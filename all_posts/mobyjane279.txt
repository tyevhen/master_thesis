hi a b ! came across this article and thought you might find it interesting seems the idea is catching on that what and how we think has an impact on our lives afterall ! warm regards , ginger http www economist com node dear ginger , thanks so much for the link the bias in thinking the fearful rather than the neutral or positive idea is a good one remember that josef breuer got his ideas by resurrecting the work of th century mesmer who profited from paracelsus' ideas and later emil coue carried the ideas into suggestion which became what we know as hypnosis freud came to learn from coue but he was too neurotic and controlling to understand the principles of hypnosis as a deep relaxation and meditation as far as our bias in thinking is concerned , unfortunately because the brain and its product the mind is basically a defense mechanism , our default program is always the anxious guardian looking for problems where there may be none we can override this looking for problems and many people learn to do it as children those of us who do n't learn to be more pro active and positively thinking as children have the harder task of retraining our impulse reactive fearful thinking as adults it can be done , of course and we must do it to live calm and productive lives my back problem was very difficult for me as i was on drugs and constantly fearful , sometimes actually escalating into panic attacks luckily i have done a lot of work in the past years to get rid of depression when it comes , so i had some tools at hand to get rid of the despair and fear not easy though it takes courage and perseverence to insist on managing what you are thinking one terrible panic attack happened after i was suffering withdrawal symptoms from the medication because i came off it too fast i had to say to myself hey , you know what this is , this is a panic attack you do n't have to run to the hospital or start screaming that you ca n't stand it and wake up everybody but of course i had immediate empathy for those who do rush to the hospital because it is so desperate a feeling , like you are going to die so again i said to myself , hey you know that for a panic attack you need to do deep breathing , belly breathing , concentrate on your breathing , do n't think about anything else but your breathing do it ! ! do it right now ! ! ! you have to take control of your thinking right now ! do n't think about your terror think about belly breathing brainswitch to belly breathing so i relaxed my body , took a deep breath , put my hand on my belly and with every breath in i said in with the white light of healing and love and with every breath out i said out with the dark gloom of despair and fear it was the hardest thing i ever did in my life god , it was so hard ! but i did it i did it over and over for about twenty minutes the terror would try to take over and i would switch my mind to belly breathing , back and forth until i could concentrate mostly on my breathing and i did indeed recover completely , lying there in bed next to my sleeping husband of course i wanted to wake him and scream and yell and go crazy and leap out of bed and insist he drive me to the hospital because somebody has to help me so yes , what you think determines your emotional well being but knowing that is not enough you must put these cognitive behavior techniques of brainswitching into practice over and over in your life until you develop tools that you can count on to save your life a b curtiss
