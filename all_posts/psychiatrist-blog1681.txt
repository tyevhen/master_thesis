google has established an advisory council for health related googling there are something people on the council , but no nurses and no psychiatrists as far as i can tell at least , no one is clearly representing these constituencies of course , you cannot put together such a group without others complaining that they did n't get a seat at the table make the table too big , and it is hard to get things done but , given the fact that one of the main medical areas that folks do searches about is psychiatry and mental health , they need a web savvy shrink i 'll volunteer and nurses are the infrastructure that supports today 's health care system the u s system does need fixing , but would completely collapse without nurses they need a seat , too
