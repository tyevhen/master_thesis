there seems to be a lot of blogging these days about how many twitter followers and or folllowees is too many inevitably someone will mention dunbar 's number wikipedia , paraphrasing gladwell , says that the dunbar number is a theoretical cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships these are relationships in which an individual knows who each person is , and how each person relates to every other person no precise value has been proposed for dunbar 's number , the person who wrote this wikipedia entry points out , but a commonly cited approximation is approximation ? precise value ? the value comes from a combination of observations in primatology specifically , observations of grooming behavior in apes and comparative anthropology of a retrospective sort i e , looking at human organizational patterns of the far distant past bottom line this is a social metric based on ape habits and the tribal activities of ancient peoples it 's hard to imagine a less appropriate starting point for talking about the new modalities of social interaction made possible by technology that is still emerging do the grooming habits of non human primates really apply to twitter users ? that 's a pretty big disconnect for me i make no assumptions about how many social contacts a modern human can have over the past years , a lot of effort has gone into the invention of new technologies that extend the social reach of individuals the automobile the telegraph the telephone the internet dunbar hypothesized that language itself may have been invented as a cheap way to maintain large numbers of social relationships a cheap substitute for one to one physical contact is there a limit on how many friends a person can have ? what does it mean , in the online world , to maintain a friendship ? some friendships in the offline world are low maintenance , while others are high maintenance i have friends from school and or prior lives that in a few cases i 've reconnected with after decades of no contact , and guess what ? we 're still friends think of how many times you 've found yourself in an airport waiting for a connecting flight , and you strike up a conversation with a total stranger , and go home with that person 's contact info after hitting it off does that not count as a friend relationship ? we 're in new territory with the social web technology is connecting people in new ways debates about how many online friends are too many especially when they invoke concepts from primatology seem pedantic and parochial dunbar 's number is not some fundamental constant of nature it 's not planck 's constant it 's a theoretical construct from sociology let 's not give it more stature than it deserves in fact , i say let 's call it what it is nan not a number and move on
