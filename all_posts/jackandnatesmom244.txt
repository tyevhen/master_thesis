today is jack 's iep meeting for the first time , i am not going alone an advocate is coming with me unlike before other iep meetings several drafts have already gone back and forth , information from jack 's private providers has been shared and i have provided a detailed parental input document i feel like a little kid going to the principal 's office i need to shake this feeling off and go in with the attitude that the school has a responsibility to provide these things for my child i am glad to have a teammate , i am glad that i feel prepared i have examples of jack 's work and i have my boxing gloves tied around my neck will not put them on unless necessary i want to have a good working relationship with these professionals as we have a long road ahead of us i feel as though this meeting will be very telling will they compromise with us ? will they take my concerns into consideration ? how they react today will tell me a lot about what the future holds so please wish me luck deep cleansing breaths
