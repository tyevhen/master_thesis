there 's not much going on in my life these days i appreciated all of your comments , as usual , about stigma i'm still fed up , and i now resolve to speak up even more i encourage you to do the same the only way to educate others is to discuss our illnesses , and their debilitating effects , with others like i said , i'm rolling along my training is going well i had two great workouts already this week yesterday 's tempo run was a bit more difficult than i would have liked , but i got it done i'm set to run miles tomorrow morning weird i'm actually looking forward to it i get a lot of thinking done over those long miles i guess it 's kind of relaxing for my brain like i said , weird work is going well i'm still getting comfortable with seeing outpatients , but i'm a little less freaked out than i used to be i 've actually been shuffled around to some other buildings lately , as our building has been really slow working in unfamiliar surroundings brings more challenges and anxiety , but so far i 've handled it okay i hope to continue feeling more and more comfortable and skilled as time goes on my mood remains good , and my thinking is clear i'm maintaining an attitude of gratitude today working in healthcare , i'm constantly reminded how quickly one 's life can be unexpectedly altered i'm feeling grateful for my good mental and physical health today i'm feeling grateful for my buddy , my companion , my boy that 's my dog , puck he keeps me smiling and grounded i do n't know where i 'd be without him an attitude of gratitude try it and keep on keeping on , my friends
