i'm feeling tired today i am right in the middle of my triathlon training program , and i'm scheduled for hours of workouts this week , next week , and more the following week from that point , the workouts decrease as i get closer to triathlon day so i'm feeling tired as my time working out has increased , fitting the workouts in around work has become more difficult yesterday i biked before work , at am , and did the strength circuit at pm i got a quick nap in after work tomorrow will be similar i have an hour of swimming intervals before work and then the strength circuit again afterward the current schedule calls for at least to hours of training each day no wonder i'm feeling tired fortunately , all this training does seem to be making a difference i'm re discovering muscles i have n't seen since college volleyball ! my jeans fit better , and i believe i can see some abdominal muscles again ! i 've also noticed i'm tolerating the workouts better that is , i can go faster and longer while using less energy than i did a few weeks ago this all makes feeling tired right now a little more tolerable the training seems to be working so far my work has not suffered from my workout fatigue , but i'm getting a little nervous that it will soon getting up at ish , working out , driving minutes to work , working hours , driving minutes home , and then working out again is getting a little overwhelming yet , i'm doing it so far that continues to surprise me hopefully , i can maintain until we start tapering boy am i looking forward to that ! only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go t s eliot
