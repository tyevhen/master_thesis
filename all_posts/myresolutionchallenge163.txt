the big news here in the uk this week was the birth of the royalbaby , unfortunately i had to miss all the coverage as my next july challenge was to go one week without my television thank goodness for the radio , heart fm kept me up to date with everything i needed to know re baby news and i was also lucky enough to share my challenge with ed and rachel 's breakfast show live on air it 's not very often i get such a flamboyant start to my challenges but this week 's did get off to a pretty impressive start due to the closure of birmingham 's queensway tunnel for my international readers this is one of the main routes in and out of birmingham city , ed and rachel were asking their listeners to call in with their own 'closures' as i'm an avid fan of the show i thought i 'd give them a ring and see if they could assist me with closing down my telly of course this simply meant switching it off but you all know how dramatic i like to be after ed and rachel counted me down i very dramatically pulled the plug on the fifth member of our family ! so there you go my five minutes of fame and what a giggle it was the week 's nearly over , have i missed the telly ? no i have n't , after last week 's no facebook i did worry that i may develop a nervous twitch , but this week 's challenge has been fairly easy the only night i did struggle was friday the children and i have a film night every friday we pick a dvd and stock up on popcorn , we close the curtains and pretend we 're at the cinema single mum with three kids , ca n't afford the real thing very often ! it was tough when we realised that film night was n't allowed this week instead of a dvd we played hangman , pictionary and a board game called 'are you smarter than a year old' which i am not apparently so what did i do without the television ? in one week i 've managed to read and a half books , written two short stories for competitions , a flash fiction compilation , done some research for my ya novel and even attempted a lipogram this challenge got me wondering how much time i actually waste watching friends re runs so i did some sums and in one week i 've managed to claim back hours will i be plugging the set back in again , it would n't bother me either way the kids may disagree although if you told me the vampire diaries was starting tomorrow i 'd fight you for the remote control could you cope without the television , would your world be turned upside down without coronation street ? why not have a go at working out how much time you spend watching the box , it may scare you enough to pull the plug and read a good book instead
