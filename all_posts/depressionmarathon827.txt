so what if it 's degrees , gray , blowing , and soon to be very wet ! i 've got the first of four golf lessons tonight because i do n't have enough to do , right ? ! well , it will be fun i'm going with my step dad until last year , he had n't golfed in years me ? i'm a beginner i had some lessons about years ago , but then i did n't play until last year , so i forgot most of what i 'd learned i'm looking forward to learning the correct way to play , despite the weather i'm feeling better still a little off , still need lots of sleep , and now i have a nasty cough , but my congestion has cleared up yesterday i overdid it i rode a really hilly bike workout for minutes immediately afterward i crashed ! my muscles ached i felt feverish i got a stabbing headache i guess my body was n't quite ready for that level of effort yet i went straight to bed after taking some advil and that helped so much that i was able to go for a slow minute run later in the evening puck was thrilled with that puck still has me concerned i wonder if he does n't have arthritis in his feet over the past week , he limped on one leg for a few days and then limped on another for a few days after that i 've upped his arthritis med , and today he seems to be walking equally on all four but he 's not himself any exercise leaves him sore , yet he goes stir crazy without exercise i just do n't know what to do damn , i wish he could talk ! work went well today i'm getting used to all the paperwork , but it 's still a lot to remember my mood seems to be okay , too , despite the stress of being sick and learning a new job i'm hanging in there i hope you are , too
