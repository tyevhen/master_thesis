at various times in our lives , we all need help trusted friends and family members can be a source of strength and support to help us cope with difficult times but sometimes friends and family are not qualified to help us work out our problems at those times , you might decide to see a psychotherapist how to choose a therapist ? choosing a therapist can be a daunting task , especially if you 've never been in therapy before how do you know what to look for ? how do you know if a particular therapist is right for you ? there are many different types of psychotherapy how you do know which one would be best for you ? how to choose a therapist feeling comfortable with the therapist i believe that the most important factor in selecting a therapist is whether you feel a connection to the therapist , regardless of who recommended the therapist or what type of therapy they practice so , how do you know if you feel a rapport with a particular therapist ? i recommend going for a consultation and trusting your gut instinct now , it 's true that you might not feel comfortable the first time that you go after all , it 's not easy talking about personal things to a stranger so , you might need to go a couple of times before you can distinguish your initial discomfort , which is normal , from what might not be a good match between you and the prospective therapist make sure the therapist is licensed make sure that whoever you see is licensed i cannot stress this enough unfortunately , there are many people who call themselves therapists or counselors , but they 're not licensed and they have no professional training unlicensed , untrained wanna be therapists usually do more harm than good and it 's best to steer clear of them if you 're not sure if they 're licensed , you can contact the state professional licensing board or go online if they 're licensed , their names will appear with their license number and the date of their license of course , having a license is no guarantee that they 're a good therapist , but at least it 's an indication that they meet the state 's profesional requirements ask for a consultation during the consultation , feel free to ask the prospective therapist questions about training , skills and experience if a therapist is unable or unwilling to answer these questions or s he becomes defensive or turns the questions back on you , move on how to choose a therapist ask for a consultation you also want to know if the therapist has experience working on the particular problem that you are experiencing you can also ask about their particular theoretical orientation a therapist should be able to explain this to you in a way that you can understand without using jargon many therapists are eclectic , which means that they work in many different ways , depending upon the needs of the client during the consultation , ask yourself do i feel heard by this therapist ? does the therapist seem interested in what i'm saying ? other than normal anxiety that most people feel during an initial consultation , do i feel comfortable ? you might need to interview a few therapists before you find the right one for you and do n't feel badly or that you 'll be hurting the therapist 's feelings if you decide to choose someone else any professional therapist understands that not all therapists are good for all clients if fee is a consideration , talk about the fee do you have out of network benefits that will provide you with a partial reimbursement ? a meaningful experience in therapy when you find the right therapist for you , you are likely to have a meaningful experience you 'll have a chance to free yourself from old negative patterns that are keeping you from thriving in your life psychotherapy can be a rewarding , life changing experience good luck in your journey i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a psychotherapy consultation , call me at or send me an email josephineolivia aol com
