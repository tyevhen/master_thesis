so i was playing around on the internet i 'll explain later maybe in a third blog entry for today ? and i came upon a site that uses state of the art technology to match your face to the celebrity you most resemble it made me realize how amazing it is that we do n't have a cure for cancer yet and also that i must have an invisible mustache anyway , i uploaded a photo and excitedly wondered what celebrity it would tell me i looked like maybe it would tell me that i look like kate moss , or suzanne sommers or heidi klum this was my first result okay i thought at least the computer thinks i'm hot ! well at least it thinks i am hot i decided that i 'd check out who else the computer thought i looked like so i hit next and i got this result i immediately hit next again because i thought this has to be some kind of mistake but no there was not a mistake i really must actually look like a man still , i thought i 'd give it one more shot i was discouraged by this result , but decided that maybe next time nope but at least i did n't have a mustache in this one this is about where i started needing a hug what am i going to do with my life ? ?
