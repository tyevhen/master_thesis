well , it 's been a few days of hell around here tracking down and contacting plagiarizers , contacting web hosts , filling out official forms for google , and generally stressing out has been exhausting i feel like i did everything i could do , and fortunately both offending websites stopped using my content i think i'm lucky since this began , i 've read countless horror stories from others who 've been plagiarized and not had the same resolution i guess i'm grateful the people i contacted took appropriate action , even though it was their inappropriate action which created the situation i must once again thank mohican for the amazing detective work and assistance and thank you all for your ongoing support okay enough about that ! onward and upward i had a killer workout this morning at i stepped onto the treadmill for a minute hill and interval workout ouch ! it was a leg and lung burner then we had a power yoga class i love power yoga , but doing minutes of yoga after killer intervals was a lot tougher than i thought it would be whew i was glad to be done this morning ! i came home and collapsed on the floor next to puck before i could even get ready for work i was a little late for work tomorrow calls for minutes on the bike followed by a mile swim speaking of work still no word from my potential new employer i 'll call tomorrow if i do n't hear anything my current job , however , is going well things have been much more relaxed around there lately one of my assistants the one with a strong personality left a couple weeks ago it 's made a huge difference the department stress level has decreased while the teamwork has increased it 's amazing that one person could make such a big difference , but clearly that was the case here it 's much nicer to go to work now i'm off to bed now i 'll leave you with this it 's from a necklace i got from my friends at christmas the world finds hope in those who wish for a better life and have the courage to follow their star wherever it may lead
