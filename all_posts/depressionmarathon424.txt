i just returned home from a weekend in milwaukee where jet and i visited my boyfriend , d as usual , it was really nice to see d , spend time with him , walk along the lake with him , run with him , talk with him , eat fabulous meals with him , and enjoy jet with him the four hour drive there and back , especially back , tires me out , but it is so worth it we were particularly close this weekend there was no particular reason i think it 's just the natural growth of our relationship , which is so wonderful i'm pleased with how comfortable we 've gotten with each other , and i'm really pleased with how much he enjoys jet he even kissed jet goodbye today i do n't think he ever pictured himself doing that to a dog ! soon it will be time to go up to his lake home in northern wisconsin , which unfortunately is five and a half hours from here he 's going up there next weekend , memorial day weekend , to open everything up meanwhile i will be here running a marathon the last miler in my grandmas marathon training schedule is next weekend it coincides with the local med city marathon , which is sunday , so i plan on running the first miles as a long run if i'm feeling well at the mile mark , i 'll go ahead and finish my st marathon if not , i 'll just step off the course and walk the blocks home it 's a win win situation , and i'm looking forward to it
