i 've been told that i have a tendency to repeat stories i 've been told that several times , usually with the implication that i'm starting to lose it finally , in today 's new york times there 's an article that proves i'm normal according to story ? unforgettable the audience ? often not , researchers have demonstrated that there 's a difference between source memory a memory of where you learned certain facts and destination memory the memory of the person you told a fact to the story talks about a study done by two ontario psychologists they took a group of college students and gave them a list of facts half of the students were told to read the list quietly to themselves and were shown a picture of a celebrity immediately afterward the other test subjects were told to pretend that they were telling the facts to a picture of a celebrity all of the subjects were then tested to see if they could remember which celebrity fact pairs they were given students had significantly worse memories for the celebrities they were talking to than for the celebrity they were learning from the psychologists say this is normal , because when someone tells a personal story they are self involved in the process and less able to attend to the person they are speaking to making the audience forgettable , in a sense this also serves an adaptive function the tendency to blank on who i told what may in fact reflect the workings of a healthy memory psychologists have found evidence that when people reset a password or a new phone number for an old friend , their brain actively suppresses the out of date digits the old numbers are a competing memory , and potentially confounding in other words , if you spend a lot of memory power keeping track of what you 've told and to whom , you 're going to forget more things overall so there i'm going to pass this little item along to the person who teases me about my repetitive personal anecdotes or maybe i 've sent this to him already , i do n't remember
