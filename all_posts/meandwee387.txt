hello ! this weekend we put up our christmas tree as a married couple , we 've never had a tree each year we ponder it over and decide it is n't worth the hassle that , and we are always traveling here and there during the week before and the week of christmas sure , we 'd put out a candle maybe and perhaps a wreath but i just never really got into the spirit of things in terms of decorating to make an effort this year was much the same way again , we would n't be around much come christmas day but , late in the game , i started to get this feeling inside this voice saying that this was the year to begin that if i want to teach paige the importance of this holiday , then we need to begin now it started with putting out a few decorations i 'd had stored away sequined wreaths and a candle then i ordered a kiddie nativity set before you know it , we decided to get a tree and break out all the decor and ornaments we had this is paige 's first christmas and i want to show how festive it is i'm so glad we did ! saturday , in the late afternoon , we broke out the egg nog and hot chocolate and set to work paige helped put the very first ornament on the tree her first one which is a picture of her and the phrase first christmas , paige it brought tears to my eyes to be honest i still ca n't believe she is here with us and celebrating such a special holiday in our household , we celebrate christianity chris is catholic and i am non denominational christian christmas time is a wonderful chance for us to celebrate the birth of our savior and celebrate his special day and i look forward to teaching paige all about it we also look forward to teaching her about all different religions and to have an understanding and appreciation and respect for all of them anyway , paige truly enjoys the tree and inspecting the shiny ornaments and twinkling lights there 's a magic in her eyes as she takes it all in it 's like she knows that we are celebrating the one who blessed us with her i give thanks every day , but just this one time a year we get to really go all out to show it i'm so happy we did here is paige putting on her first ornament well , she helped anyway here , paige is enjoying the ornaments as i point them out here is maren and chris she wanted to get in on the fun too here , i am singing silent night to paige as she was about to go to bed chris caught it with the camera and here 's our elf , little p , enjoying the lights before bedtime save
