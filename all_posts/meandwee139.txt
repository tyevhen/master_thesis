hey there ! so , the clutter in my kitchen is insane i just ca n't seem to keep up we get so much junk mail , school papers , school art projects all kinds of little things and it always ends up in piles on the island and kitchen table agggghhh ! then , i attack it but it always comes back it 's like the blob remember that movie ? if you do n't hear from me after this , i may have been consumed by the piles never to be seen again until you try to find the latest electric bill i realized a lot of the pile was things i did n't want to get rid of , like special pieces of art or keepsakes , so i ran to target and got these cool file boxes one for chris me , one for paige , and one for noah i have a folder for each year and i just stick things in the folder that i 'd like to keep for them easy ! now , i just need to stick with it next , i need to start filing away coupons in their own folders and deal with paying bills right away and i 'll be sitting pretty i'm mortified i just showed you my crazy mess , but it 's a part of me like teenage acne or a bad perm it 's something to endure we also need a new table and chairs upholstered chairs and kids do n't mix they are disgusting right now but i want a cool wood table and chairs and they have to be small i have n't found anything that fits the bill yet , so we 'll see besides , it will be clean for a minute before paige grabs all kinds of her crap and covers the table with it all ya gotta live life , right ? and look what we discovered ! you can take that fast food drink carton thingie and use it for little animals ! we had a ton of fun at our zoo and put the animals underneath in their cages where they have little windows to peek out then , we pretended they were mountains and valleys , and then we flipped them over and pretended they were little pools for her marine animals it was great , cheap imaginary fun i saved those drinkholders so we could play store or cafe with them but that has n't happened yet zoo is a worthy choice , i think save
