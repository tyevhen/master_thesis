yesterday was my big boy 's th birthday nine ! it seems impossible , and yet he is creeping up on me height wise not the hardest thing to do haha jack has been having so much trouble behaviorally with peers and teachers , we have been so worried about him well , we still are as most autism parents know , particularly asperger 's parents , birthdays are not necessarily something we look forward to other kids birthday parties are hard enough john recently took jack to one and was texting me a blow by blow of jack 's struggles my response ? yes honey its like riding a bleeping roller coaster while going through the stages of grief all wrapped into one bleep package and tied with a snake so as you can imagine , jack 's own birthday celebration felt like walking into a landmine last year he had a hard time at his birthday party we had lots of kids there , we were at a farm , and he was just overstimulated the thing that put him over the top and caused a meltdown was getting a present he really liked so what do you do about that ? i decided that in light of all the difficulties he is currently having , i was going to surround him with only people who make him feel safe people who , if he had a meltdown , would not be shocked , people who would be supportive this consisted of his grandparents , his bcba , his and jack 's aba techs , and his two best friends from his old school and their families it actually ended up being a pretty crowded house mommy was having some sensory overload issues of her own ! jack ? he did beautifully thinking about it this morning brings tears to my eyes he was able to wait until everyone arrived before having cake with no issues he was able to verbalize that he did n't want the birthday song a long standing trigger for him the applause more than the song and because everyone around him knew him , they were n't surprised and were just fine with basically standing silently while he blew out the candle and they did n't cheer which is crucial no one asked why the cake was decorated with the koala brothers , an african crested porcupine , a rooster , and a sopwith camel it was jack's cake , so duh , lol he was able to sit and eat cake with all of his presents looming without losing it this is a big deal for any kid really , for jack it was huge he was soooooo happy to see his friends he was bouncing around everywhere , but made sure to introduce his best bud to his mimi they actually went trick or treating together last october , but whatever mimi , i need for you to meet my good friend it was priceless another amazing milestone for him ? opening gifts in front of others every holiday , he and i go through the do 's and do n'ts of receiving gifts and it has been getting better , he has n't said i hate that in a long time but he usually does n't pause to look at his gifts either he rips through them , does n't look to see who they 're from , etc and yes , i know all kids do this , but it 's just more extreme with jack he started out that way , but i was able to talk him into sitting on the couch for the most part and allowing me to hand him his gifts and with this process he did start to actually see what he was receiving and he looked at things he looked through books , he pointed to things he liked he looked at clothes there were still a few moments , but over all he did very very well he got two die cast world war i airplanes he did at one point tell someone not to touch or tickle him when he was holding his die casts because does n't every year old say that ? he was probably having flashbacks to the die cast sopwith camel he received when he was i had to glue it back together no less than times that day it was not a good day but in the end , he let his granddad hold one of his planes , they even played war for a couple of minutes last night was a crucial reminder for his dad and me when he feels supported and secure , he is the same jack we have always known and loved funny , and personable , empathetic and yes , hyper he is in there we just have some things to work through
