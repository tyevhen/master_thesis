it 's hard to be aware of what people come here for for the narrative ? for a poem ? i 've looked at traffic and i ca n't figure it out i do n't blog in response to traffic but i wonder if i have a steady readership that skips the narrative for a poem or vice versa i should think more come here for the narrative as few delight in poetry i do n't write for poets either i write for the discipline of writing if i practice no other writing today , at the least i can blog i do n't think therefore that curiosity is over and experiments no longer in vogue so here 's my experiment , begun at pm august i'm going to post what i think is a very good poem and also timely in view of the morass in iraq with three hours left tonight , only have graced this site today let 's see what happens , shall we ? i 'll report tomorrow at kilorats , ce at the vietnam war memorial black granite stretches its harsh , tapering wings up to pedestrian level grass but sucks me down , here , at the intersection of names i forgive , i must , though i wish something could heal this wound in the earth behold , all theorists , the price of theory extreme unction by napalm and blood , vets shipped home whole or in pieces the va grants prostheses but not minds free of horror in jungles tumescent , through villages of straw , by the mekong where catfish sleep in mud heaven , we tramped , disarming mines and flushing tunnels , killing women and children for potential collaboration , smoking thai stick until stuporous still , the sound of charlie played on every frond beat against this polished rock , america , this vast projective surface for your sins , wear your bloody heart out it 's not how many died but that they died in vain , achieving nothing except our grief for them it 's said you cannot write a good poem until recollected in tranquility let this then be a bad poem , bad as the war , dividing author from reader and reader from page let it drive a wedge between fathers and sons let fathers mistake rebellion for disloyalty , let sons mistake honor for stupidity , let senators mistake appropriation for commitment , let mothers confuse waste with sacrifice , let sisters turn to prostitution to forget let teachers suicide in public in partial recompense , let preachers castrate themselves for passive assent , let everything in america that breathes hang its head in irrefragable shame here is the legacy of your assumptions , here the necropolis of your dark suited wisdom a city set in a pit cannot be hid ok , the experiment begins now we 'll check again in hours
