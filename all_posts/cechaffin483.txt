today 's sonnet i wrote for kathleen 's and my sixth wedding anniversary , sept yes , virginia , there is true love in the world and i found it with kathleen even so , poetry has its own demands , and though i wanted to write a very romantic sonnet for our anniversary , the poem took a wry turn to set up a simple conceit prefigured in the title you ca n't force a poem to be something it 's not , a frequent beginner 's mistake you ca n't manhandle a poem and expect it to be something worth preserving as i tell my students , get out of the way of the poem so i did with this one , though i think it at best an average example of my work at rodent neutral , thank god ! ce thinning a verb i love pistachios and basketball and blackberries and the furious mane of spray when ocean batters rock and the pall of fog through pines above the aqua bay i love fireworks and my guitar and everything the beatles ever wrote i love the charm of a familiar bar and my worn flannels and my paisley coat though you won t see me wearing them together i love asparagus and artichokes and licorice whips and nuts and rainy weather and halloween and good off color jokes have i devalued love with things too steeply to say i love you and not mean it deeply ?
