the jews sit shiva for a week and then go back into the world yesterday kathleen went back to work and i returned to my writing despite a sense of unreality and a constant feeling of exhaustion , it is time to soldier on this will , of course , not prevent bouts of weeping and the thousand yard stare but continuing in life is best when walking through grief the jews also set one year aside for mourning , after which it was officially over these recommendations fit the needs of the human spirit well , though no law should be made of them the law was made for man , not man for the law i am especially grateful to my sister , elisa , who has given me the luxury of having no financial worries during this time of arranging plane flights and motel reservations i also want to thank tom summers , rachel 's great uncle , whom i think paid for the viewing and cremation when i went into the office to pay , the funeral person said , it 's already been taken care of i aim to pay him back but will not burden myself with such concerns at this time several things have occurred after rachel 's death which , for those who know our family history , will be instantly recognizable as something to do with rachel while nuzzling kenyon the night after the viewing , i apparently hurt his left shoulder and he bit my nose and bruised my eye nothing serious , though blood was spilled i am only the second human he has bitten though i have needed shoes for months , the first day we returned to the coast we walked into a shoe store in a daze and each bought a pair of shoes while walking through the flora near the beach , the local salt marsh flies attacked me en masse and i have been scratching myself ever since i have no intention of turning this blog into a journal of grief , but when it bubbles up i wo n't repress it my writer 's conference begins tomorrow and i have two musical performances on saturday it 's cool and humid here i sleep but i never feel rested my pants are tighter what 's this about weight loss and grief ? kiloneutral and holding , craig erick
