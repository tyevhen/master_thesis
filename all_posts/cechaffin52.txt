i saw my psychiatrist today , who increased my antipsychotic medications he wants to be aggressive with my illness i read today that bipolar depressions usually last at least six months i'm almost up to four months with this one , but i do n't want to repeat my two year horror again my only hope is in medications now that ect failed me , i know of nothing else to treat this damnable condition it 's nothing i did or did n't do i was born with the dna coding for bipolar illness it first expressed itself when i was i did not know what it was then , i simply withdrew from everything around me , including friends , going from class president to recluse two more dark sonnets below not my best but i do follow the form xvi there s not much left to what i haven t said depression is a monster , simply put , a harpy sent to thieve your daily bread and leave you groveling in an endless rut a rut is but a grave with ends kicked out oh you can belly on and squirm and twitch yet come no nearer to another route because you cannot see above the ditch prayer and meditation prove no better than drinking beer and lying on the couch when you are being judged by every letter of the law , transforming you to grouch who sees all contact as a threat to being so any outstretched palm results in fleeing xvii i d rather have my skin scraped bloody and raw by a barbecue grill cleaning brush than to suffer depression i stand in awe at how the weight of it endeavors to crush whatever good lives in me , which is all a grand mirage of who i used to be before the odious , odiferous pall of self despite became reality have you a spark of goodness left to share ? don t waste it on this carcass , i am past receiving anything , i do not care for anything my illness will outlast it s cyclical , you know , it will come back and paint all my cathedral windows black six kilorats , ce
