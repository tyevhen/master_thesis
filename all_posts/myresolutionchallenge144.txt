my mum and i regularly attend the hobbycraft show at birmingham 's national exhibition centre in time for christmas mum stocks up on her crafty bits and bobs and i carry the bags ! it 's become a mother daughter tradition and regardless of the aching muscles and swollen feet , it 's a tradition we both enjoy the demonstrators on the stands are quite amazing , many of them can be seen on the create and craft show , they can whip up a stunning card in minutes using embellishments , glitter glue and a partridge in a pear tree they make it look so easy my mum is of the same breed i remember as a child watching her make amazing cakes for customers birthdays and weddings , homemade jams and marzipan fruits she then discovered crafting and never looked back , abandoning the oven for gelli plates and distress inks so as my december challenge is all about making things for christmas i decided to see if mum 's creative gene was hereditary one of my favourite stands at the show is lavinia stamps as an avid fantasy enthusiast i am always drawn to the displays of twinkling faeries , full moons , playful elves and mystical doorways in fact , if tracey ever developed a wallpaper range i 'd be first in line ! the lavinia stamps website is packed with inspiration , sample videos , galleries and projects you can also watch lavinia stamps on youtube and really get your creative juices flowing we all know how fond i am of challenges and i was happy to see the lavinia monthly challenge blog in full swing you can follow on their facebook page and send your own entries to be in with a chance to win worth of lavinia goodies it was as i attempted to re create some of the stunning cards from the website that i realised mum 's creativity gene had skipped a generation ! my little cards may well be hidden at the back of the window ledge but i had a lot of fun getting messy with inks , stamps and glue i think i'm going to enjoy my december challenge i know i have an abundance of creative readers so it 's over to you guys what have you made that you are proud of ? do you make your own christmas cards or presents ?
