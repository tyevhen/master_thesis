i had an extremely shocking and surreal day on monday i had a suspicion , and it took a couple of tests to come up with conclusive results mr t is out of town all week , so i had to tell him over the phone i could n't keep this to myself for so long i found out that i am pregnant if all goes well with this pregnancy , it will be our second child it was neither planned , nor prevented , and i am thrilled and nervous at the same time i feel very blessed to be trusted to raise and care for another little one so what does being pregnant mean for my anxiety ? i have stopped taking my sertraline zoloft cold turkey and will definitely not take any more clonozepam until after i am done nursing even though my doctor said sertraline or zoloft is okay during pregnancy , he also said it is best to not take any psychiatric medication if you can help it during the first trimester with my first pregnancy , i was lucky enough to be mostly anxiety free and medication free the entire time i was pregnant and for about the first months of nursing my mother was the same way she always felt better when she was pregnant i am hoping it will be the same with this one i am nervous about any side effects of suddenly stopping my anxiety medications usually if i forget to take my sertraline for more than a day , i get horrible stomach aches and cramps i do n't remember feeling any side effects last time i stopped for my pregnancy , so i am hoping again for the same it is not okay to take clonozepam during pregnancy or nursing besides possible birth defects and withdrawl symptoms in the newborn , it can cause your baby to have gray teeth ! when i was deciding to get pregnant the first time , i did n't know if i should wait until i recovered from the anxiety before getting pregnant or not this is partially why i have the feelings i do about being cured from your anxiety if you feel that way , you can put off these life decisions for who knows how long instead , i decided that this may be something i need to learn to live with , and therefore , when i felt i had the social anxiety under control , i felt comfortable getting pregnant i consider myself lucky that i do so much better with my anxiety when i am pregnant , but that does n't mean you will be the same way some women find their anxiety symptoms get worse after being pregnant so if you are contemplating this decision , my advice would be to wait until you feel you have successfully learned and used the tools to manage your anxiety and then go for it if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like big news and lots of anxiety to go with it worst fears sometimes do come true an update to get you through the day why do we shut people out when we need them the most ? linkwithin
