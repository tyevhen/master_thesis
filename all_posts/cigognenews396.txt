most of my readers know about my notion of the three levels of consciousness that what happens to us in the womb , at birth and infancy is registered low down in the neuraxis and constitutes what i call the first line as we grow up we may suffer neglect , trauma and or lack of love that will take place on what i call the second line and what happens to us in adulthood and in the present is called the third line it is possible to relive events that happened on any of those lines , but they have to be in order feeling the third line first , second on the second and first line last what is clear is that so long as we leave one level untouched we can get relief from reliving on the various levels but not cure because the traumas on the first line have not been addressed final resolution means reliving on all levels , otherwise we have only skimmed the upper levels , leaving the powerhouse first line untouched that is , to be clear , we can feel real feelings with their real force from the second line , in the first months of therapy but if there has been first line trauma it must be experienced if it has only been minimal it may not ever have to be addressed that is rare , indeed all in all , it is the difference between relief and cure lots of relief from second line primals but not cure after years of primal therapy we know that what is often behind later strokes , schizophrenia , epilepsy , severe addiction and heart attacks are first line traumas they are nearly always packed with force and are also most often life endangering so one can spend months in therapy and still be prone to a stroke or heart attack because the basic primal imprint , the generating source upon which later traumas are added or compounded is first line yes , we can get increasing relief as we go on in our therapy but if we are to discuss cure there must be obligatorily reliving of first line that has the strongest valence and remains the most dangerous imprint lodged in our system the first line left unfelt will always be a danger in later life we may have take out fifty percent of the emotional force in primals about childhood but gestation trauma can still kill us that is why it is not a good idea to do this therapy half way you can say , i got what i wanted out of the therapy but the system is insisting , not enough ! you re life is still in danger none of us want to say to patients , you know you must go on with the therapy it makes us look avaricious , wanting to keep the patient with us that is not the case we want to save lives through the integration of feelings , and that cannot happen in a few weeks or several months of therapy it is indeed dangerous to allow patients to go to first line when starting therapy that can upset everything and only insure major symptoms from migraines to epilepsy that means first line events are pressing at the repressive gates if allowed to erupt too soon , the system cannot integrate it all and the result are symptoms when a medical patient is given medication that is much too strong the system cannot integrate it and its excess force is flushed out through , perhaps , diarrhea nearly all key symptoms are the result of overload we take pains to make sure it does not happen the aim is integration and resolution , not feeling as a thing in itself such as crying or screaming out or pounding the walls that feeling has to become part of us until it does it remains alien , an external force treated is an enemy of the system and when those feelings are strong the person can run a high fever the system feels it is under attack danger is imminent the feeling is pushed away not accepted as part of us , and of course , not integrated the feeling must become part of the family not an outsider that has to be shunted aside once it is part of us we can grow we no longer have massive blockages impending our progress expressing our feelings can only have meaning after we have been in the feeling otherwise neurology and evolution is backwards using the third line intellect to get us to feelings , when it is the third line that must recede in order to permit access to full feelings if the notion and the decision about where we need to go comes before feeling , the evolution is reversed and we will fail in therapy even while we think we are doing marvelously in a so called feeling therapy we cannot abrogate evolution and do well in therapy because evolution is how nature acts it is an iron law of human behavior
