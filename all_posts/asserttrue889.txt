problem i need to be able to use the 'yield' keyword in a greasemonkey script this is a javascript language feature available in firefox and later you must explicitly turn on support for this feature , however , by specifying script type application javascript version in the html page that 's not what i need i need to turn it on in greasemonkey 's execution context others have run into this problem it appears , however , that the greasemonkey guys wo n't do anything about it i was hoping there 'd be some clever back door way to do this , but that seems unlikely there appears , alas , to be no workaround , short of the usual for greasemonkey expedient of vulturing the unsafewindow , which is of course repulsive and unacceptable if anyone knows of a non ugly solution to this problem the problem of how to use 'yield' in greasemonkey scripts , please advise
