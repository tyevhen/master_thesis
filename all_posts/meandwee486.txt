hi friends ! i'm pleased to tell you that little p 's ultrasound and checkup went great yesterday ! she is sizing a week ahead and is in the th percentile for her measurements , so she 's still growing great ! they listened to her heart rate while she wriggled around and we heard the beat go from the mid s to the mid s after all her action they told me it was just what they wanted to hear the ultrasound was something ! now that she 's so big it 's hard to tell what i'm seeing on the screen we can only usually see one body part at a time and it takes me a bit to understand what i'm looking at ! at one point , we saw little ps face and her leg foot in front of it ! how flexible ! i could see the chubby skin around the bones of her face and could kind of make out what she looks like sort of i noticed right away that i thought she looks like chris and has his facial structure it fascinated and humbled me to breathlessness it was one of those moments where time stops around you heavy another issue i head to labor delivery in weeks where i will start my non stress test routine i 'll go twice per week every two weeks for anyone not familiar , they will strap a belt thingie on me and monitor the baby 's heart rate for about a half hour and also check for contractions movement they 'll want to make sure her heart rate goes up appropriately after any movement to make sure the placenta cord are working properly and that she 's getting the oxygen she needs add this to the ultrasounds and regular appointments and i 'll be quite busy at that hospital for a while ! we also started our childbirthing class the other night it 's for weeks at hours per session it felt very surreal sitting there listening to the woman discuss the intricacies of the pelvis and uterus when it seems like yesterday i was sadly watching everyone else heading off to their classes and now there i am staring at diagrams of a cm cervix vs a cm cervix in relation to my own birthing experience coming up it 's a whirlwind i do n't think my emotions have yet caught up with what i'm experiencing maybe i'm afraid to feel too much until she is here and safe ? i just know that hope is a strong emotion that has carried me when i was too weak to move hope has been my magic carpet there 's a lot in my head i need to work through i 'll be back soon with some other little thoughts and bits going on around here i'm happy it 's the weekend and i hope you enjoy as well ! save you might also like mother 's day and the birth it 's getting interesting noah 's birth linkwithin
