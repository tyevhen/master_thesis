i had the opportunity to work this week i worked three , four hour shifts the good news is i'm doing okay despite the stress of working in fact , it did n't feel so stressful this week that 's a change for the better i was pretty anxious prior to the first shift i worked on wednesday , but my anxiety subsided soon after my shift began , and i was able to focus on working it helps that i work with wonderful people who were happy to see me back i'm lucky in general , i 've been doing well i'm feeling good my mood has remained stable i 've been taking care of what needs to be taken care of lately running my errands , completing my housework not all at once , tapering for boston , and going to meetings it 's so nice when life is easy , when the grip of depression is loose and there is light in my world i'm grateful i continue to be humbled and honored by you , my readers your comments surprise and satisfy me i am so happy to hear my simple writings make a difference in your lives thank you thank you thank you
