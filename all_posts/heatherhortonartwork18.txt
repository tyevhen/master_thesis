where is the summer going ? it has been a long time since i posted so i will get right into some new happenings i am continuing to work on paintings for my solo exhibition this coming november at abbozzo gallery in oakville , ontario it has been so difficult to hold back showing you new work so i have posted a snippet of one above i wo n't say any more about it other than i think i have fallen in love with painting water it is like a different type of fabric delicate undulations that invite distortion it is a great challenge and what rewards we can reap from pushing ourselves ! i am so happy to watch this painting unfold and develop day by day if you want to see the finished piece first hand , you must attend my solo exhibition ! i will publish finalized dates when i know them , but it would be a real treat to see you there dear reader the group of paintings in the show will be autobiographical back to what i love to do paint people i know , in places i love or am inspired by new friends old friends self portraits a couple of mountains perhaps i have been thinking lately about change big changes and then i become afraid of the tumult and upheaval then i return to the excitement of possibilities and back and forth i go in my head while i work at my easel joseph campbell had it right when he said follow your bliss and the universe will open doors where there were only walls above is a photo of my breakfast a couple of weeks ago blues and reds are the best ! speaking of blues i have a new colour in my palette cobalt turquoise by grumbacher this fabulous colour seems lifted right out of the intense blue of the mediterranean was introduced to me by yvonne petkus , a talented painter and art professor at western kentucky university her palette has many green teal blue variants , and it opened my eyes to the rewards of introducing even one new colour into your orchestra of pigmented instruments to use ! this colour is fabulous for the water that i am painting currently it has immediately become a staple in my palette finally , i am going to be packing up my paints and canvases to head back to the yukon in two weeks i will work and hike there i do not have to tell you how excited i am to head back to my favourite place the north expect more blogging while i am there less distractions more silence silence is wonderful there is a lot of silence up in the yukon lots of opportunity for introspection everyone has their own yukon is it moab , utah ? northern ontario ? waterton , alberta ? your backyard ? it matters not i think just to find an oasis for your soul even once is worth everything it is a place to repair wounds , inspire new ideas , help bring resolution , bring you closer with your true nature these places help us realize who we are on our deepest level , and the location , as i mentioned before , is irrelevant i hope that you have found such a place , or many places halfway up mount white , near the yukon british columbia border i hope that this entry finds you in good spirits happy , healthy and enjoying every moment of your day , wherever you are stay tuned for most posts soon thanks for your patience while i have been painting for my exhibition i will post all of the paintings once the show is up at the gallery if you have any questions about my artwork or would like to inquire about paintings that i have posted already , please contact abbozzo gallery toll free at or via their website please feel free to check out my new website as well ! on top of mount white being an artist means not numbering , but ripening like a tree , which does n't force its sap , standing confidently in storms , not afraid that summer may not come rainer maria rilke
