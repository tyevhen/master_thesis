recent ecological studies have shown that bacteriophage viruses that attack bacteria are numerically the most abundant biological entities on the planet the estimated viruses mostly phage in the oceans , if stretched end to end , would span farther than the nearest galaxies these viruses are thought to cause the turnover , by virus related death , of of the ocean 's biomass per day in shotgun sequencing of marine samples , the majority of phage gene sequences are invariably found to be novel not corresponding to any other known gene sequences hence , the bulk of genetic diversity on the planet may well be tied up in viral phage dark matter one of the most studied bacteriophage classes is the so called t even t , t , t , etc class of phages , of which the poster child , arguably , is t these are phages that attack enteric bacteria e coli and its relatives , hence are commonly found in sewage t phage morphology t is interesting from a number of standpoints , not least of which is its distinctive head tail morphology see diagram in phylogenetic studies , t typically shows up in basal positions on trees , meaning it is presumably ancient increasingly , viruses and phages are considered to be of primordial origin , possibly predating cellular life certainly , any theory on the origin of life has to come to grips with the fact that the major biomolecules proteins , nucleic acids , lipids had to exist , in some form , prior to the appearance of the first cell some experts suggest nucleic acids and proteins may have interacted with each other in a so called virus world scenario see the excellent paper by koonin wherein microscopic hydrothermal pore systems in mineral formations at the ocean floor provided for sequestration of prebiotic processes in physical compartments that could be invaded by selfish replicators primordial interaction of proteins with nucleic acids and their precursors presumably gave rise to a number of artifacts that survive today , such as ribosomes which contain over small proteins in tight association with rna , trna rna covalently bound to an amino acid , adenine containing cofactors e g same , nadph , and viruses capsid and other proteins bound to rna or dna conceptually , one can think of protein nucleic acid complexes as having diverged , at the darwinian threshold , along two lines toward ribosomal life , or toward the viral world bacterial cell covered with t virions the genes for certain viral capsid proteins with colorful names like jelly roll capsid are among a number of viral hallmark genes that show no homology to any genes from the cellular world presumably , some of these genes are of truly primordial ancestry we have a valuable clue to the origin of at least some of these genes in the case of phage t a number of tantalizing reports from the s see here , here , and here suggest that the enzymes dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase both encoded by t dna are , in fact , components of the virion baseplate and or tail structure of t hence , at least in some cases , it 's conceivable that virion structural proteins began as enzymes what 's particularly intriguing about the t enzymes is that t 's thymidylate synthase thya , which is phylogenetically ancient , is encoded in the phage dna immediately downstream of the gene for dihydrofolate reductase , with no intervening junk dna why is this significant ? in many organisms as i explained in an earlier post , these two enzymes occur in a single large bifunctional enzyme that 's proposed to be the result of a gene fusion event in organisms that have the double enzyme , the reductase occurs at the beginning the n proximal end of the protein just for fun , i took the protein sequence for t dihydrofolate reductase and fused it in notepad with the sequence for t thymidylate synthase , then did a blast search of the fusion sequence against all the protein sequences at uniprot org the naturally occurring bifunctional thya dihydrofolate reductase enzymes from peach , balsam , rice , castor bean , and clementine citrus clementina all showed up as hits , with e values of or better this does n't prove that the bifunctional enzymes of the peach , etc came from t phage , of course , but it is consistent with the general idea that the bifunctional thya dihydrofolate reductases of algae and protists could at least in theory have started out as phage gene fusion products let 's put it this way weirder things have been known to happen
