i wrote a week ago about how i made on my money overnight when amazon stock crashed it 's time to add a footnote my strategy of buying put options ahead of the earnings announcement was to protect my actual shares and it worked but what about the shares themselves ? they went down in value by around on october most amateur investors , after seeing their shares go down overnight , will panic sell and take their lumps that 's seldom a good strategy , however if you liked something at , why would it not be even more attractive at ? the morning of the amazon stock crash , i bought more shares immediately in the intervening time , amazon has gone from just a week ago ! to this morning buying more shares turned out to be exactly the right thing to do the moral is if you believe in a stock , buy more of it when the price goes down do n't panic sell at a loss will amazon keep going up from here ? no one can know that , of course but i think six months from now , amazon will not be under , any more than aapl will be under why buy amzn at all if the company shows no profit ? because free cash flow is still growing the only thing that could take amazon seriously lower a share , say would be a major health event that causes mr bezos to leave the company unexpectedly if bezos ever leaves , i expect there will be a very short lived dip in the stock price you should buy that dip any subsequent management team will be perceived rightly or wrongly as more responsible and more likely to force profits to the bottom line than mr bezos and that will take the share price sky high bear in mind , bezos could make amazon profitable overnight , any time he chooses , just by turning a few knobs but doing so will interrupt the company 's growth right now , he chooses growth that 's worked very , very well so far
