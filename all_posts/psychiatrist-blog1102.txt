dear medical student this is why you should become a psychiatrist it 's a wonderful career with lots of flexibility and you can pursue a broad range of interests you love people and their stories ? you love feeling helpful in their lives in an integral way ? then psychiatry 's for you what better then being there when a seriously depressed person feels better and gets their life back ? you hate people , ca n't stand complainers , and would like to isolate yourself ? ah , psychiatry has so many unanswered questions and can let you flow in so many different directions find a lab and isolate genes or look at brain scans or receptors there 's lots of room in the field for basic researchers you 're something in between ? psychiatrists have medication practices , or psychotherapy practices most have a little of both , they teach , they are administrators some never go near a patient they can work with inpatients or outpatients or in residential settings they can work in jails or with the courts they write , they have blogs ! they work for themselves i never fight with my boss or as part of large academic or government institutions they work with patients with medical illnesses on transplant teams , in oncology and hiv centers , as consult liason docs in the general hospital you can find a job where all you do are evaluations and you never see the same person twice or you can be a psychoanalyst and see one person five times a week it 's as medical or non medical , researchy or non researchy , and people centered as you want it to be and you can do pieces of a variety of different things what could be better ? no big bucks sorry
