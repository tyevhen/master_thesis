from the santa rosa press democrat , ap former judge donald d thompson , a veteran of years on the bench , is on trial on charges he used a penis pump on himself in the courtroom while sitting in the judgment of others more she court reporter lisa foster testified that during a trial in , she heard the pump during the emotional testimony of a murdered toddler s grandmother and the allegation came to light after a police officer heard pumping sounds my , after such a long and distinguished career , already receiving a mo pension , donald d must find this deflating he in my opinion pump perjured himself in testimony when he claimed the device was just a gag gift he should have thrown away but is n't it really an anti gag gift , since it wo n't gag as some humans are known to do even if it ca n't swallow ? as a pre viagra doctor i used to prescribe these things they are generally composed of a plastic cylinder with a pump that sucks air out of it , creating a negative pressure , so that when the open end of the cylinder is placed closely around the base of the penis , the penis fills with blood they 're clumsy , and the erection is hard to sustain so many of these devices come with rubber cock rings to slip down the erect penis before the blood leaks out and in my examining room i used to have to estimate what size ring to prescribe that 's a good way to ruin your practice sexy , huh ? the devices were n't very successful in my experience , for the most part producing a hard on with the attitude of a drooping hot dog and i never had a patient tell me the experience produced an orgasm , so do n't think of poor donald d as soiling his robes this story is n't that juicy my dear and darling wife , kathleen was rather horrified by this revelation , but i said , hey , trials are boring , think of it as if he were just chewing gum in reply she said , craig erick , you are disgusting ! i knew that but seriously , have some compassion for this man he had to wear a big black dress and sit on his ass all day , listening to procedural drivel and picayune wrangling while trying to appear attentive after years of this he needed something to keep him attentive yes , a little risky , but i think playing with the pump kept him sharp as for indecent exposure , how did the clerk or policeman peek that far behind the bench ? i 'd say the judge 's privacy was invaded he could get years and have to register as a sex offender if convicted , a sentence crazier than using the pump for donald 's sake i hope the judge that handles this case also handles himself occasionally to stay attentive still , is n't the possible sentence taking the rod of justice too far ? i say , what is done under the bench stays under the bench let the poor guy go so he took an infantile comfort in this penis pump , did he hurt anybody ? only the court reporter 's sense of propriety get over it , lady , and wait until your man gets old of course the freudian aspects of his behavior are obvious he 's acting out as the naughty little boy with oedipal problems , willing to risk everything to pretend to dominance , while secretly hoping to be caught , punished , and relieved of the responsibility of the bench by a powerful mother figure he should have just gotten a private spanking partner for these urges no need to humiliate oneself when another would gladly do it there 's a whole cult of spankers out there , btw , claiming not to have intercourse but simply exchanging swats they think it wholesome i knew one who was spanking his best friend 's wife and vice versa his friend never found out there 's millions of paddlers out there , trust me there 's something about sex that brings the infantile out in all of us for any interested , i'm at about kilo rats of depression i actually had a few positive feelings in inspecting my vegetable garden yesterday and even in the worst of depressions , i never quite lose my sense of humor , even if i ca n't laugh humor , freud taught us , is a mature defense in my family of origin that means black humor is there any other kind ? thine as always , c e chaffin
