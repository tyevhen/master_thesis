one day i woke up and got the bug to make a change in the kitchen so , i went out and got chalkboard paint and made an accent wall ! probably much to chris' chagrin he is still dealing with fixing some of my , ummmm , mistakes and trim smears i tried though ! ! ! i got all the cool vintage y decorative items on the wall from becky at box antiques nearby in groton , ma as you can see , i added some chalk birdies and some chalk plants coming out of the glass mason jar and , we got a little refurbished dresser from becky as well ! i put it under our photo collage in the kitchen and it holds all our countertop clutter i e catalogs , school papers , coupons , kids' drawings , markers , doo dads and whatnots i was so sick of looking at piles everywhere and am so glad to have a place to stash things i want to keep for a bit so those are some recent little changes that have helped make the space our own ! save
