by jack smith thanksgiving was my father 's favorite holiday it may have been his favorite day of the year he would rise early , whistling with gusto and singing silly songs in the shower , while mom did all the work in the kitchen dad loved thanksgiving because it was the one day of the year he was sure to see almost all of his smith kin , most especially his five brothers and sisters they were an unusually close set of siblings , their relationships forged by fire with the tragic early death of their mother , who died when the youngest was just an infant , and the premature death of their father , who died when my father was in college after living for years with a broken heart , never remarrying or even dating every thanksgiving morning , after watching big bird , kermit and others float through manhattan , we 'd pile up in the station wagon and motor through the wiregrass toward geneva , home of my namesake uncle jack and his sweet wife , my aunt mill , hosted all the smiths every year they fried up the best hand breaded chicken fingers you 've ever tasted and put out salty apalachicola bay oysters before any of us even arrived i ate more fat oysters on saltines , dripping with tangy cocktail sauce , than one could count
