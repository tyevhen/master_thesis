three weeks ago , while i was n't paying attention , my blog this blog surpassed the one million page views ytd mark i ca n't be sure where the traffic is coming from , since i refuse to click the do n't track your own page views link in google analytics it could still be mostly me hitting refresh or someone with anonymous perfecting a really , really slow denial of service attack or maybe my deceased mother discovered a time machine years ago , only she did n't tell me about it and she traveled to the future just to pay some dweeb in milwaukee to unleash a reddit clickbot that messes with me , then headed back to to cook dinner it almost has to be one of those things here are the top posts of the year , so far post views how i fell in love with a schizophrenic jan , , comments how to write an opening sentence jan , , comments are placebos really sugar pills ? jan , , comments the serif readability myth jan , , comments information theory in three minutes may , , comments now for some really interesting to me summary info , looking back at this year 's posts five posts accounted for of the year 's traffic four out of the top five posts were written in january the top two most trafficked posts had titles that begin with how , but beyond that there 's no thematic pattern whatsoever to the top posts nor could i have predicted the popularity of any of them in advance this year 's posts account for only of total ytd traffic the other of visits went to prior years' posts but note well , prior year posts were never as popular as they are this year the split is new , in other words it used to be more like my blog got a certain amount of extra traction after april , when i signed on as a regular blogger at bigthink com thank you , dan ! , but honestly , the crossover traffic from bigthink has been quite modest my traffic really started to pick up in january , when i began blogging almost daily prior to that , when i was blogging only a few times a month , to hits a day was pretty typical it slowly built , over a period of four months or so , to a couple thousand visitors a day , peaking at k hits day in early summer it 's eased off a bit since then i now count page views a day as typical but i should stress , that 's total site visits , spread across posts the other thing that 's different now is that i have , followers on twitter , up from about , a year ago the numbers are deceptive , though it was n't until this year that i began devoting an hour or more a day to interacting with my tweeps rather than just dumping curated links in their laps all the time but twitter is another story , worth its own discussion i 'll save that for a future post what have i learned ? not a whole lot , actually the main thing i 've learned is that if you want traffic to increase , blog more often and do n't be afraid to write some fairly long posts , if the subject matter warrants it my no most visited post this year weighed in at words i hardly touch facebook , i hate google circles , i do n't do instagram , i ignore stumbleupon i have a pinterest account that 's growing mold somewhere oh , and i pay no heed whatsoever to seo i operate on the assumption that good content is its own seo i never spend money , by the way , promoting anything i do no google ad campaigns , no paid slots anywhere in short , if someone came to me with a bunch of money and said tell me your best secrets for getting more blog traffic , i 'd say go write the very best content you know how to write , and do it every day if possible otherwise , several times week try to achieve synergy by contributing in more than one space i blog here and at bigthink com , plus i tweet a lot i post updates at linkedin every week even though it feels like hollering into a cardboard box and i spend an hour a week commenting on other people 's stuff around the web beyond that , there ai n't any magic just blow a lot of smoke and keep the mirrors shiny
