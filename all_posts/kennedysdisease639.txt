i asked dr fischbeck for an update on the current clinical trial at the nih he provided the following our current trial of novartis drug bvs here at the nih now includes sites , in the us and in europe information about it can be found at the clinicaltrials gov website https clinicaltrials gov ct show nct the trial is progressing well , and with the added sites we hope to finish it in a few months we won t know the results until the trial ends and the data have been analyzed , but at this point i am optimistic if the current trial shows a robust benefit , then a follow on study to confirm safety and efficacy is likely , and that could well include additional sites meanwhile we are in discussions with other companies about new drugs to try , perhaps by late or early when dr fischbeck uses the words , ' at this point i am optimistic' , it brings a smile to my face and a flash of hope with eight sites involved in the trial , the results should be more indicative of what we can expect if , and i use the word if , bvs should ever become available the clock is ticking for some of us living with kennedy 's disease sbma , but that does n't mean that many of us , including future generations , wo n't reap the benefits of a treatment for this condition so , stay tuned and do n't give up hope
