what choice will you make ? as many of my readers are in post , and are at an age of leaving school , i thought it would be useful to begin my uni life series , which will take you through a step by step process of university there are many life changing decisions we have to make in life and university can be one of these it 's not just young students that are considering taking this path , but mature students too there are many possibilities with higher education it 's not all about the stereotypical image and can be far from it for many higher education students and for some mature students , university will be the main thing that is on their mind it is a life changing decision after all nevertheless , i think it 's extremely important to make an informed decision as to whether it 's something you want to do , without buckling under the pressures of schools and parents therefore , i 've decided to create a mini series in which i work through university step by step , including the decision making , ucas , what happens on arrivals and the academics although my school gave me books full of information , nothing really prepared me for the whirlwind i was going to go through , which is the beginning of my first year of university schools are putting a lot of pressure on students to go to university , but please do n't let that sway you schools are only doing this to look better in the league tables , but of course there are teachers that should guide you in the right direction you have to remember that by the time you reach the ability to decide university , you are at an age where you are in full control of your life do n't let schools or parents make you do something that you do n't want to do with your life of course , university has many benefits , but it 's not always for everyone it 's up to you to weigh up the pros and cons there are so many opportunities besides university too , and please do n't feel like a failure if you do n't go to university as i know that 's what many pupils think there are full time jobs , apprenticeships , diplomas , and so on although , i feel i have made the right choice for me , it may be completely different for you and do n't feel ashamed take your time to decide and make a choice that suits you best wishes , amy xx
