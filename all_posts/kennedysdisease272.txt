i am almost healed and it feels good to be among the living again since i started taking dustasteride , i have been keeping a journal i reviewed it today and these are some of my observations about the last five days saturday i missed my first day of exercises in over three years just too weak and , i had to move my long program from monday to this morning because of weakness and an upset stomach i really missed my exercise routine i knew i had to get back on the horse this morning and fortunately i could by this afternoon , i noticed some muscle soreness fasciculations increased dramatically for some reason the facial and hand tremors were the most obvious i will have to ask my neurologist if he is understands why i still have more noticeable twitching in the arms and hands today leg and abdominal muscle weakness was the most pronounced my ability to stand up from a chair and my balance were the most effected i am assuming that the legs are weaker because they are carrying of weight why would the abdominal muscles be so weak ? i noticed a greater weakness in the left side of my body i know that muscle weakness is asymmetrical in those of us living with kennedy s disease i question why the left side when my dominant side is the right ? during my long exercise program today , i noticed my upper body strength today was very good perhaps of normal while my lower body was still abdominal strength is somewhere in between because of the wasting of the facial and upper body muscles , i look much thinner after only a few days of not , or only lightly , eating two neighbors commented that i looked thin or asked if i was dieting my wife takes far better care of me than i do saturday i ate like i was well again a cheeseburger , ice cream , and shrimp pasta with garlic butter sauce come saturday night and sunday , i paid the price the price for overindulgence when my wife took control of my wellbeing i quickly began to mend i am perhaps over analyzing this , but i find it interesting i also hope to learn from my mistakes that would be a first
