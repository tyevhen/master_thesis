last week , noah got his first taste of solids rice cereal to be exact it 's more for him to practice using his mouth with a spoon and swallowing than it is to taste the food it 's pretty gross and i do n't blame him for his lack of excitement over the whole thing ! he 's to try it once per day for the next little while as he gets the hang of it maybe i 'll try to feed him something a little bit tastier i feel bad for the fella on sunday , noah also had another first rolling over from his back to belly ! he 's been trying for a while now , but he finally got it ! and i got the camera just in time to catch the finish of his big roll i did n't think he 'd be able to do it and then there he was looking up at me ! so , more firsts are checked off as he grows sigh i wish i could keep you little , my little snuggle bear right when he finished the roll ma , did you totally just see that ? i'm awesome ! save
