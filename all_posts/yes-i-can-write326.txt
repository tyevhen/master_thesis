i was thinking about how to describe unschooling now there are plenty of descriptions you can use , all pretty accurate , but mainly i was thinking about how you differentiate unschooling from , say , eclectic or relaxed homeschooling many eclectic homeschoolers call themselves unschoolers , and i was trying to figure out why that bothers me , and why i think a distinction between eclectic homeschooling and unschooling should be made basically , it comes down to this unschooling is letting go of control over your child 's education eclectic homeschooling , however , is letting go of some control certain bits of control it 's saying i trust you to learn r and x subjects , but i don't trust you to learn y and z subjects that seems to me to be sending mixed messages either you trust your children to know what 's best for themselves , or you do n't this in between ground , though certainly better than school at home , still seems to me to be lacking that important trust and respect taking it further , radical unschooling is letting go of control over your child 's life i want to make it very clear that when i say letting go of control , either referring to a child 's education or their entire life , i do not mean letting go of your child , in the sense of becoming an absent parent unschooling is becoming more involved in your childs life , not less ! many people seem to equate control with love , for some bizarre reason , and then think that if parents are not controling their children , they 're just being lazy and not showing love for their children however , without control , you can still help your children support them love them control , in my mind , makes it harder to help , support , and love your children , not easier in adult romantic relationships , control is not a good sign control , of what you eat and wear and do , of who you see , is considered , rightly so , abuse in such situations so why is it considered acceptable treatment for children ? some people also think that unschooling can be dangerous if you 're letting your child do whatever they want , they could cause harm to themselves or those around them and this brings me to the point that unschooling , and radical unschooling specifically , is treating children with the same respect as you would a person of any other age if my best friend tried to walk in front of a car , i would physically stop him the same applies to a child if a toddler is crawling along on the ground eating cigarette buts , it 's not okay to let them ! unschooling means not making arbitrary rules it does n't mean letting someone do something that will likely cause harm to themselves or others i think some of these thoughts could certainly be worked out more , elaborated on , etc , and i'm certainly not the first to address these issues , but since i 've found myself in the place of explaining unschooling to people lately , i 've been thinking a lot about how to address various points how to put things in a convincing way that makes sense to people so i'm just working things out here peace , idzie you might also like unschooling and freedom debate blame unschooling ! unschooling notes on unschooling from our talk at the aqed symposium linkwithin
