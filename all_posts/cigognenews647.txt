in neurosis there is a loss of integration among brain sites so that memory cannot be conflated with inner sensations and external reality we lose our wholeness so that past and present cannot be differentiated remember again that when animals are traumatized and then put again in a similar situation without the trauma , the brainwaves are practically identical the brain cannot tell the difference between past and present , and forces us to react as we did in the past even when that reaction is not called for in neurosis we live in the past without being aware of it we are shy with others because an angry father forced us to give in and submit unquestioningly this kind of father takes the child s no away so that later on she cedes to other s wishes all of the time thus , she reacts in the present as if it were the past without lower level connection to higher levels , we are only considering the late developing cortical brain and not the brain as a whole sadly and happily , no one can make a connection insight for us it must come out of a feeling , and it must do so in slow orderly fashion when the patient has the connection , we know it is time when the insight is forced by a therapist , it usually is not the time organically it defies evolution ideas after feelings , not before neurosis manages to fragment that reality disconnection feeling therapy reestablishes that total reality there is a unity of nature that happens only with connection connection , therefore , is the merging together of related neural networks on all levels of consciousness it should be clear that dissociation restricts consciousness , not awareness , and we need consciousness , not awareness , for control i can make this same impatient individual aware left frontal area in therapy that he is terribly impulsive and cannot stand waiting , but that does not produce the bottom to top connection that allows for control the connection between deep right brain and left pre frontal brain even with full awareness , the right lower brain sends impulses throughout the body that gnaws away at various organs the result may be colitis often first line originated or bleeding ulcers , which cannot be stopped without first line access the aware person can be totally unconscious of all of this the unconscious has no way to become conscious in the neurotic neurosis means an altered state of consciousness that includes defective or impaired bottom to top brain circuitry in brief , the brain is rewired in the adult , instead of feeling the need for love and caress , one may feel immediate sexual impulses or the drive to eat the more that those circuits are deviated and continue to fire in a specific way , the more the rewiring becomes reinforced we need to go back and relive the times of first deviation if we are to make headway to resolving it we go back to reset the set points toward normal that is why in our therapy , the naturally produced inhibitor or repressor serotonin is enhanced after one year of sessions its set points have been reestablished it is sometimes possible to get relief by delving only into later childhood traumas , leaving the prototype in place if the threshold for symptoms is raised by this approach , all the better there will be no overt symptoms but the tendency is still there thus , an alcoholic may not be forced to drink when some of the pain is relived , but he will always be in danger thereafter if we are looking for total personality change , it will not be possible without addressing the imprint if one is happy with having no symptoms , then so be it it is the patient s life , not ours early trauma , birth , and pre birth , will generally interfere with the proper evolution of the right brain and its connections to the left it remains so excited that even neutral events can set it off do we need a therapist to help us see outside reality ? no we need a therapist to help us find the internal one the rest takes care of itself to be specific we need to access the right brain because that brain specifically the orbito frontal cortex and the lower brain , as well contains a map of our emotional history and our internal state with access we don t have to figure out what happened to us at age two , we can re experience and know it and we will immediately know how that experience drove us that is why recall is so different from reliving let me hasten to add that there are any number of limbic structures and adjacent ones that are involved , including the ventral anterior cingulate which seems to straighten out our perceptions it is beyond my competence and intent to discuss them
