how many times have you second guessed your actions ? not just once , but even hundreds of times ? i know i have at the beginning of my mental illness journey , i second guessed everything i did i spent hours thinking about what could happen to me i always came to the conclusion that something bad was going to happen to me , which was drawn from my irrational thoughts and i know i'm not the only one who experiences this it meant that i would have panic attacks when i tried to leave the house , catch a bus , go to school and so on any task was a challenge if i compare this to now , i can automatically walk out of the front door and catch buses all of those struggles i used to battle for hours before i could tackle them , are now a natural part of my life and hold little to no problem i do n't have a second thought about what if 's and even if i do , i can control these thoughts there are areas of my life which still do cause me panic and lots of thinking , which usually comes in the form of health anxiety or societies , for example and it is something that i am working on nevertheless , it 's awfully strange to think that just a few years ago i spent hours debating whether or not i had the strength to walk out of the door and now it 's such a natural process i am proud of how far i have come and you should also be proud of yourself ! progress does happen , even if you feel it never will one day , a struggle that once cut you up inside , will not even be a worry in your head it 's almost magical amy xx
