boy , we 've been slammed with rain lately i spent another run soaking up the sky today running is a lot more difficult with this weather the cold , wet and gray is not good for my mood either i think it 's been one week of dreariness , and i 've definitely noticed a corresponding dreariness in my outlook despite the weather , running is going well my training is right on track , and my knee feels better that 's a huge relief ! it 's hard to believe i'm coming up on one month to go before the big day well , actually there may be a little day this weekend before the big day one month later let me explain i may run a marathon training run this weekend i know , i know , maybe it 's not the smartest idea , but running another miler alone is daunting a saturday small town marathon , on the other hand , is quite inviting besides , local runners will be traveling the hours to run it , too i have until thursday to sign up , and right now i'm leaning toward doing it hopefully , it wo n't be raining !
