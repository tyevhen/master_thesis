unfortunately because of an increase in spammers leaving bogus comments on the blog , i have had to take the dreaded step of adding word verification to the comments i hate having to do that on other people 's blogs , so i apologize that i am asking you to do it as well i only want your amazing feedback , ideas , suggestions and questions and i do n't want to dilute the content with unwanted spam if it turns out that the comments really start to suffer from this then i will reverse it and just keep manually deleting the spam as it appears for those that don t know what the heck i am talking about , what this means is that when you leave a comment from now on , it will ask you to type in some letters numbers in a box first to make sure you are a human and not some spam it only takes a few seconds to do , but it is an annoyance that i wish we didn t have to do update also another annoyance is when people leave comments that are simply to sell something they are promoting they do n't leave anything valuable except a few words and a link if someone wants to promote their product on my site , they can email me with permission and i can look into it for them but if comments are left that are just advertisements in disguise then they will be deleted if you are a blogger that has a relevant post to the topic and would like to leave a link to your post with some valuable feedback that is different and i do n't mind you sharing your thoughts on the subject , in fact i would encourage it its just the sales tactics of products that bother me i really do appreciate all of the thoughtful comments you leave so please do n't let this distract you from sharing in the future you might also like upgraded the forum what is rss ? how to stay up to date with the reality of warning my incessant monologues are hardly adding twitter , facebook , and followers linkwithin
