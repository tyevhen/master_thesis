have you seen the movie , the bucket list , starring morgan freeman and jack nicholson ? did it make you think ? do you have a list ? i do long before the movie i had a things to do before i die list i'm thinking about this now because i recently watched a video of a woman with ms talking about her list that led to a discussion with my boyfriend and now this post like i said , i 've had a list in my head for years and years it 's changed a bit from time to time i 've also crossed a few things off already , like running the boston marathon and traveling to australia most of my list , however , has remained consistent and intact over these many years but it 's always remained in my head for some reason , i 've never actually written my list down perhaps i 've just never taken the time to write out my bucket list perhaps i 've neglected to write it down out of fear maybe the written word forces me to be accountable to myself if it 's only in my head , if i do n't tell anyone , it 's much simpler to walk away from the goals , to pretend they never existed i guess there 's less chance for disappointment that way i think it 's time for me to write out my bucket list these are some of the things i want to do during my lifetime i am free to add to or subtract from this list at any time , of course , but for whatever reason , i now feel the need to put it out there and what better place than here ? after all , writing this blog was somewhat of a bucket list item see the list i want to be a voice for those with depression and to reduce the stigma surrounding mental illness i want to write a book i want to jump out of an airplane on my list since the age of i want to climb a mountain i want to hike to the basecamp of mt everest i want to travel to and volunteer in africa i want to compete in and finish an ironman triathlon i want to travel to antarctica i want to remain sober , one day at a time i want to be a competitive runner into my 's i want to take a wwii historical tour through europe that 's it for now i may be forgetting something that 's the problem with keeping the list in my head for all these years but i think this list is a pretty good representation of my desires several of them may never be realized purely out of lack of finances , but i did n't want to let that stop me from acknowledging them it 's a list of desires , not a list of likelihood most of the goals on this list are within my grasp i know i can do anything i set my mind to do i know that even the ironman , which i already would have conquered if i could conquer my fear of open water that 's a big one , because i know it will be scary and tough , but i also know it is totally doable i just have to set my mind to it what 's your list ? i challenge you now to write it down make it real i actually feel good , maybe relieved , now that i 've shared it i 'd love to hear if you took me up on the challenge
