from i 've been having a long correspondence with an old friend about christianity , both personal and philosophical as some readers may know , i call myself a christian because i believe it historically true that christ rose from the dead i have confessed him as lord , but i do n't feel it in truth i get more spiritual nourishment from nature and loved ones to be fair , theologically , that is also god acting , though i think nature too often spared criticism red in tooth and claw wrote tennyson why must nature be so filled with violence , from the praying mantis to the great white shark ? the christian explanation is that nature fell along with man , and man did not become a carnivore until after the flood but given the fossil record , it is obvious that nature was red in tooth and claw long before man appeared just look at t rex ! and there are thorns and thistles before man 's appearance thus linking fallen nature to man 's fall is anachronistic , though some believers like to think of the jurassic period as a time of monsters , of nature gone awry nonsense so when did nature fall ? when man appeared ? rubbish if in paradise the lion shall lay down with the lamb my , what big teeth you have , grandmother , for grinding grain the lion would have to be completely re designed to become a vegetarian then one could argue all these animals we cherish will be resurrected like us , not needing material sustenance but here when the resurrected christ re appeared to the disciples near the end of the book of john , he cooks fish for them that involves killing the finny tribe bleeds red just like the furry one so the resurrected christ blessed the killing of animals , did he not ? not surprising since the practice of old testament judaism is all about slaughtering animals , and christ was the ultimate sacrifice all very neat the example of the resurrected christ shows no change in man 's attitude toward nature one can make an argument that he practiced the norm while in this world , but he could have as easily toasted some bread for his disciples you ca n't argue anything from nature except beauty justice ? love ? goodness ? a good lion kills robinson jeffers is the one poet i know who looks at nature realistically , without any contaminating anthropomorphism his god finds war as beautiful as peace , the glow of an atom bomb as pleasing as a sunset if we are honest with ourselves we will dispense with the illusion that nature is some kind of soft landing , some example of kindness and goodness we will see that sea otters are predators , however cute they appear btw , cuteness means anything that resembles a human infant i have established this to my satisfaction note that those kindly disposed to aliens give them big heads and big eyes and small noses , just like the human infant so if one cannot derive the nature of god from nature , it must come from revelation then revelation must arrive through the fallen beings who record it , and where does that leave us ? with a spotty record of the truth , surely one thing that makes me believe the new testament is all the unflattering things included , like christ cursing the poor fig tree still , if we object to that action , a good christian would likely reply , who are you to judge god ? to which i say , sorry , i ca n't help it , i was born with this prickly thing called a conscience back to my original discussion i am a christian philosophically but not emotionally in other words , i believe in forgiveness but i do n't feel forgiven this is the perplexity that tortures me when i attend church , which is rarely , because i weep for loss partly the loss of my early concepts of god , as i was converted to the jesus movement when i was with my mind and mood disorder , a simple faith does n't seem to be an option , but i envy those who have it , like my friend he not only believes in forgiveness , he feels it he experiences god since most of my experiences can be questioned experientially on the basis of my mental illness , how would i know if i really felt forgiven anyway ? maybe it would only reflect a leap in serotonin levels , though the two feeling and brain chemistry are by no means mutually exclusive what am i getting at ? i do n't know like robert burton i write as an escape from melancholy in a nutshell i do n't trust my feelings , thus i am prevented from having a religious experience all through the bible one is supposed to love god with all one 's heart that is no easy proposition for me a leper cannot feel a doorknob , thus may break his wrist trying to open a locked door in the same way my feeling sensors are diseased and i do n't know whether i'm feeling god or not i do n't care how long this blog entry is , i want to know the problem why is it i ca n't embrace god ? why is it that i ca n't feel as if i believe ? where is the joy of forgiveness ? and if the christian god is all powerful , why ca n't he break through my illness and give me the gift of feeling forgiven ? my argument is that it is not just a lack of faith on my part , but a consequence of my disease before i was diagnosed manic depressive i had many religious highs which in retrospect i realize were most likely manifestations of the disease in a very real sense , this disease has robbed me of my former faith what i end up with is what i call beef jerky christianity , a faith stripped of experience , a dried up philosophical commitment to truth is this noble or foolish ? i do n't know ever since i had electroconvulsive therapy at the age of i have not been able to re connect with god the closest i 've come is taking the eucharist at an episcopal church i attended in mexico at that moment i feel as if i can believe as soon as i leave the altar i begin to doubt my experience , though i confess there is a faint glow in that action maybe i should convert to catholicism and be done with it i 've tried buddhism , but it was an inferior sect i dabbled in spiritualism when very young hinduism is a great comfort but for me no guide to life judaism is christianity unfulfilled sikhism and zoroastrianism are attractive , especially the concept of asa truth vs lies in the latter islam holds no attraction for me it seems a step back from both judaism and christianitiy we all know the dangers of its fundamentalist version in these speculations i have stopped crying the cats play it 's a sunny day kathleen is reading upstairs , dizzy with her ear infection i look forward to my youngest daughter 's visit on the th life ai n't half bad , no matter how bad i get kilorats , craig erick
