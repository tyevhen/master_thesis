at am my mind was still rushing i think talking to the guy i am going to meet today triggered it y told him i wanted to raise awareness about selective mutism i then did not move from the sofa or have any dinner until am that was about hours straight when i went to bed i did not feel tired , i could not lie still and i felt like getting upto do the some of the things i need to do today to prepare to go away it is am now , i intend to hang the washing , wash up and wash my hair before meeting for lunch at i need to go in earlier to do a few things in town doing all that stuff on selective mutism seems a little ambitous , i am going to contact the social phobia web sites at a minimum though maybe i will do more maybe not ? i will post again later if i get time !
