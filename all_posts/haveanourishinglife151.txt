i am always open to hearing and reading new information regarding mental health a couple years before i started taking medication , i treated my depression with nutrition , vitamins , supplements , and other alternative methods prior to that , for almost a decade , i had a no fat , low calorie , vegetarian diet with zero calorie drinks only once i started researching depression and anxiety , i soaked up a lot of information that would indicate my diet could be contributing to my despair so , i decided to change my eating habits through extensive research , i ended up becoming a paleo expert written with a hint of sarcasm if you really want to know more about paleo , you can look it up yourself however , i am not going to get into the details in case you don t want to hear about it i will only say one thing that you 've probably already heard there are good fats and bad fats after reading about how fat can be good , my world was shaken for the first time in probably eight years , i willingly ate full fat foods and meat i really struggled to make this switch and i often boomeranged between the two extremes for a while but , nonetheless , i could not un learn what i read about paleo for about two years , i put myself on this paleo diet because i thought that it would help with my depression unfortunately , the thought of losing weight was still ever present in my mind after a year of diligently following this diet i am a perfectionist , so you better believe i was committed , my depression was worse than ever i thought i was doing everything right i was eating an all natural diet , taking vitamins and supplements , exercising , going to counseling , and trying my best to take care of myself but things continued to go downhill after many torturous months , i ended up in the hospital i was totally defeated , had no will to live , and was in extreme despair after talking to a doctor , i reluctantly consented to taking an anti depressant since then , there has been a night and day difference for me , medication worked however , i still , sometimes , read information on non conventional ways to treat depression and anxiety because i know it works for some people so , i recently saw an informational video about treating depression without drugs there was a lot of information but , i doubt the instructor narrator guy was ever depressed and i doubt he ever had an eating disorder either strike one and two i want to hear about how people , like me , struggled with these mental illnesses and recovered but i continued to watch and listen out of curiosity in the video , the instructor dared anyone who was depressed to eat a big salad of raw veggies you can t be depressed after eating that ! he concluded a key thing to remember is that the opposite of depression is not happiness i am happy , or maybe content is a better word , after eating a salad because that is what i think i am supposed to do for me , however , eating a salad doesn t take away the underlying depression , lack of motivation , feelings of worthlessness , shame , and guilt because it is so dang hard to take a pill , i had to try this experiment again i ate a really nice , big , organic salad with olive oil for dressing it was a meal that even dr salad challenge in the video and all the hippies in new hampshire would have given their stamp of approval i felt good afterwards i like salads on occasion , so it wasn t like i was choking it down or anything i didn t notice a big difference as time went on i was glad mostly because i thought i was doing the right thing and i was optimistic that it could work this time however , an hour later i was hungry again i drank a big glass of water still hungry i didn t know what i should eat more veggies didn t sound appealing at all i started to worry about the different foods to eat and i wondered if eating them would cause the experiment to fail and my depression to come back i ate a chip a single tortilla chip and feelings of failure wash over me the old eating disorder mind set came rushing back i am a failure and i have a weak will power must have control because of watching the video and listening to dr salad challenge , i am not only still depressed , but now i also feel like a fat failure the whole rest of the day , i was really down it wasn t until i wrote down my experiment results that i realized , for me , the experiment did not work i must move on and continue along the path that works for me there is no way that physically eating one tortilla chip could have set off a downward spiral or caused eating disorder behaviors to creep up again before i was even done chewing and swallowing , i was full of shame my plummeting mood had nothing to do with the chemical , nutritional value of the chip it had everything to do with the expectations i put on myself personally , my depression grows when i try to live up to other people s expectations it comes from an all or nothing or perfectionist s attitude for me , my depression is the worst when i try to control what i eat the salad challenge might work for some , but it doesn t work for me and i have to be honest with myself about that , even though i would have loved for it to work my experiment conclusion i will continue to eat salads every once in a while when i am feeling like a salad because i like them but , i will put ranch on it , and maybe some ham or cheese , and maybe some croutons painting of the day have a nourishing day today !
