most color pickers , i find , are n't terribly helpful fortunately , though , it 's relatively easy to create your own all you have to do is generate a rainbow swatch and capture mousedowns or mousemoved events as the user hovers over the swatch , and sample the color under the mouse pointer the trick is creating a good color swatch the answer is a few lines of server side javascript the swatch shown here which has colors ranging from pure white at the top of the swatch , to percent saturation at the bottom was created by varying the red , green , and blue color channels sinusoidally , with each channel phase shifted slightly code for this is shown below to run the script , you can use the little imagemunger app i gave code for in a previous post the app puts globals image and panel in scope see previous post for details just point the app at an image file of say dimensions x or whatever , and let the script fill the image with colors be sure to use jdk colorpicker js kas thomas february public domain run this file using imagemunger http asserttrue blogspot com simple java class for running scripts html function main w image getwidth h image getheight pixels image getrgb , , w , h , null , , w var x , y , spanx , spany for var i i pixels length i x i w y i w spanx x w spany y h pixels i rainbowpixel spanx , spany image setrgb , , w , h , pixels , , w panel updatepanel function rainbowpixel xspan , yspan blue yspan math sin xspan green yspan math cos xspan red yspan math sin xspan return red green blue note that this technique can be adapted to pdf image maps quite easily as shown here it is also the basis of a pure java plug in for the national institutes of health 's freeware imagej program future projects instead of sampling the color under the mouse pointer , retrieve the target color procedurally by back calculating the color based on the x y coordinates of the mouse rewrite the rainbowpixel method to space the color channels out by degrees pi over radians instead of or degrees in the code shown above , blue and green channels are phased degrees apart blue and red are degrees apart make it so that colors range from pure white at the top of the swatch to black at the bottom , with full saturation in the middle of the swatch write a version in slider controls can be used to control the phase angles of the color channels
