shameless self promotion , but when one is single , letting people know it is your birthday seems imperative ! yes , it is my birthday today i'm listening to mpr 's radio heartland show , and they already played my birthday request , bobby mcferrin 's live version of the wizard of oz if you have n't heard it well , it 's pretty incredible i will try to link to it or put it on this blog later if i can figure out how to do that ! any help out there greatly appreciated ! i'm still recovering from the flu , which is good because my social worker is about to take me out for breakfast i think i had one real meal yesterday , so i think pancakes should go down okay this morning i'm getting a little sick of ginger ale , pretzels , saltines , and popsicles ! anyway , happy birthday to me ! the sun is shining and it may hit degrees ! what more could i ask for ? ? happy day , everyone !
