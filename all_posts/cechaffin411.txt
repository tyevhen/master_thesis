since i am not inspired , my cousin , dweebler cramden , has consented to compose another startling poem he would correct me and say that it is not a poem , that he only writes verse my mistake dynamic duo oh hear the drum ! the neocons believe their tetragrammatons will fool the public well what they don t know the average joe can apprehend the quagmire , so there s nothing left to tell cheney and bush were in such a rush to give their policies a push and send iraq to hell this demonstrates to potentates the power to manipulate is not a one time sell cheney talks from the side of his mouth his thoughts go east , his tongue goes south his head needs no gel while our commander takes a gander in all the states that do not slander what we re doing so swell bush loves his navel , he loves to travel he loves to pound his favorite gavel and smile for clientele his self delusion s so complete he lets christ wash his dirty feet inside a roach motel a war that s lost cannot be won the chance of history is gone , broken our citadel but these darn fools invent the rules they learned from all their think tank schools until we must rebel get up and wave your protest flag against your favorite gasbag and try to ignore the smell now i do n't necessarily agree with vituperous vitriol my cousin espouses , then he is also a british citizen and ca n't know the bounds of american civility i apologize to any who were scandalized by dweebler , but he would very much like to hear from anyone who enjoys his verse , especially if she is a wealthy , well padded woman of a certain age nearly neutral but afraid to claim it kilorats , ce
