no resolution yet to this most recent mind numbing , purposeless rut but maybe a reprieve yesterday , i swam today , i ran two consecutive days of exercise , and yet i still feel bad that 's the mind numbing part even when i take positive steps to take care of myself , the satisfaction which would normally follow is stolen quickly away i'm left in a blank stare thinking , and what was the purpose of that ? depression is a clever demon it steals the meaning from the meaningful strips the purpose from the purposeful life becomes a slow series of steps , literal steps , one foot in front of the other , with no reason for the journey nor reward at the end so i ask again , what 's the point ? intellectually , i know exactly the point my brain knows there is purpose even where i feel none my mind is numb , but my brain knows my brain , as if detached and looking in on the scene , answers the question as i methodically remove my sweaty running gear this is helpful , it says , even though your body wo n't let you know you have to keep moving forward you 'll only feel worse if you stop that 's been one of the few times my brain has been able to squeeze a word in lately depression is clever and consuming it normally boxes out those rational thoughts i assume , after swimming , or running , or cleaning that i will feel the satisfaction of my accomplishment a sliver of pride , maybe ? not so when depression is running the show no matter how positive the steps i take , depression bombards me with unrelenting disparaging , derogatory , and demoralizing thoughts there is no room for rationality nor emotion when depression 's thoughts consume me it took me a long time to learn and trust that these horrible , put down thoughts are actually a symptom of this illness sneaky depression ! the thoughts are mine , are n't they ? if we listen to most people , depression is the result of our negative thinking our own character defect hence , the popular fallacy that we can cure depression by smiling and thinking happy thoughts ! but it 's not true ! finally , after years of illness , millions of hours of therapy , multiple hospitalizations , and countless treatment regimens , i learned that these all consuming , horrid thoughts are a symptom not a personality flaw a symptom , not a personality flaw now that 's a thought !
