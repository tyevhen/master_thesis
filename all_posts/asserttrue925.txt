imagine if you could ping a running jvm over http to obtain realtime diagnostic info that seems to be what sun has in mind with u s patent , , , java virtual machine configurable to perform as a web server , granted to sun microsystems last month abstract a virtual machine , such as a javatm virtual machine , is configured to operate as a web server so that users , using a browser , can make general purpose inquiries into the state of the virtual machine or , in some cases , mutate the state of the vm a browsable vm contains a network traffic worker , such as an http thread , a services library , and a vm operations thread , which is an existing component in most virtual machines the network traffic worker and the vm operations thread communicate through a request data structure the vm operations thread generates a reply to the request upon receiving a request data structure from the traffic worker such a reply can be in the form of an http response containing html or xml pages these pages are transmitted back to the browser user by the network traffic worker
