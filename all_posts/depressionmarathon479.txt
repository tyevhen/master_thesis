yesterday morning our occupational therapist entered the office and immediately began blaring , the old gray mare from her i pod speakers we all laughed , as just a few days before she and one of our very elderly patients were singing the chorus to that song as they worked together it was the only way our ot could keep the patient on task we use whatever techniques necessary to get our patients to work with us sometimes later in the morning , while the ot was working with the same patient , she played , the old gray mare for her we all , including our very elderly patient , began singing along before we knew it , our typically wheelchair bound patient stood up and began shaking her hips while she sang it was beautiful ! that was the most activity we had seen from this patient in quite awhile it was great fun ! today i was half heartedly cursing the ot for playing that song , as it was stuck in my head for my entire ten mile run ! but actually i did n't mind the repetitive tune , because every time i heard the song in my head i saw our patient standing up , shaking her hips , and singing out loud it was , for me , a ten mile smile pay attention to life 's little moments , my friends they are precious
