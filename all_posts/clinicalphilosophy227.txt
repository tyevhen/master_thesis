dialectical behavior therapy dbt is said to be 'dialectical' because it moves back and forth between i a stance of acceptance or validation of the client and their experience as they are on the one hand , and ii a stance of helping them to change on the other i do n't really see that this is 'dialectical' in any particularly interesting theoretical way , but perhaps i'm missing the point and i should say , i do n't have linehan 's original book this in any case is n't a critique of dbt , only a question about the pertinence of its name there is however a dialectic that seems important to me to cultivate in any therapy this is between i engaging with 'the part of' the client that is an agent , desiring change , can feel hopeful , and ii engaging with 'the part of' the client that is a patient , fears change , feels hopeless managing this dialectical encounter appears important and this is because if i just engage empathically and acceptingly with the hopeless part of my client , then they will feel accepted and cared for , but ultimately remain helpless and powerless if , on the other hand , i just engage with the part of my client that feels hope , wants to change , dares to be brave , then i risk losing them when they do n't feel brave , are scared , hopeless , powerless i risk too not hearing their distress and coming across as unempathic in my work i am experimenting with being as honest about these two parts of the client as i can be discussing the dialectic not usually in those terms ! with the client themselves wondering with them where they are at , whether they feel heard and which part of them is doing this hearing i have the idea that the tension between these parts is what keeps the therapy itself alive i also have the idea that the agent can be recruited as a reconditioner in the sense of behaviour therapy for the patient parts of the client i mean to say that , if there is a need to change habitual patterns of feeling , activity , and thought , then the way to do this may not be directly cognitively or affectively , but from the ground up behavioural conditioning , and the agentive part of the client can be recruited as the self directing provider of this therapy in their daily lives you know , like practicing the violin you make yourself do it and eventually the requisite neural pathways get layed down for spontaneous expressive access in the future i am suspicious that this is too active a model of successful therapy , since it focuses far more on what i do than on who i am but that is a topic for another day
