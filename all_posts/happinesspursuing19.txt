a few years ago i whipped up a tea from all the herbs in my garden that , according to rodales herb book , were supposed to relax a person or otherwise produce a feeling of well being i ca n't remember everything that was in it i think there was some lavender and rosemary and maybe some lemon balm and other stuff it tasted terrible , something like dirty feet but damn it was effective i wish i 'd written the recipe down because that tea was the best stuff i 've ever taken for my depression anyway , i thought i 'd see if there was a commercial version out there and tension tamer is my first one to try it 's not bad it tastes kind of weedy and lemony , not the best tasting tea in my cabinet but tolerable the effect , however , is disappointing it might bring a small hint of relaxation but nothing like the punch to my mood that my homemade tea gave me listening to a george winston album is better for me than this tea i'm still going to drink my way through the box in the hope that there is a cumulative effect
