down again we meet , medusa and stones cannot cry yes , i remember that face the unshaven pastures of my cheeks bloated by hangover , my eyes purple wells so i drink too much would n't you ? awkward giraffe , i lack speech to say these leaves have lost their taste music affects only irritation , touch frightens and food sickens my psychiatrist says , you suffer from anhedonia looking down a well water and darkness do not soothe it 's hard to explain because the gray muzzle in me moans for lack of howling at the sickly moon beneath the smog line how dead that moon appears like my own pock marks in a mirror
