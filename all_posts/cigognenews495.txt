i had come back from the european theater of war i landed in new york and heard about a new guy playing something none of us ever heard before bebop we went down to nd street to hear him , and it blew us away his name was charlie parker years later he was found wandering the streets naked and showed all the signs of severe psychosis now what has psychosis to do with bebop ? a lot just a smidgen of neuroscience late research shows that inventive jazz playing and i include bebopis largely right brain , just the place where very , very early trauma is imprinted , where our key feelings reside , and where we need access in order to invent in music and get well in life wow ! what a tall order alas , it is also the place that pain can break through and disrupt our functioning it happened to poor charlie who was run by his right brain , happily and unhappily it helped him invent and go crazy he did not have enough left brain to integrate his feelings and suppress those too cumbersome he did not have enough left brain to stifle his inventiveness charlie s music was wild , florid , unconstrained , liberated , unpredictable , unexpected and flourishing it went off in many directions at once , which is why we all had such a hard time learning it it was the beginning of a very new music , thanks to a pre psychotic who could not contain his feelings like dali , it made him the most creative and also very close to madness
