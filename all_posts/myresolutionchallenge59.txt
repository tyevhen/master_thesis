last week i talked about not having to be perfect , you can read that post here it leads me on quite nicely to this week s post how to have a good day not having to worry about being perfect helps us to go with the flow and relax our outlook on life i attend a creative writing class every monday evening , where i have to read out my work to the group when i first started , i was terrified that my writing wasn t perfect , and i would be laughed out of the class what i failed to realise , my fellow students are in the same position , we all want to improve on technique and find new ideas i relaxed , and suddenly my writing improved and i even got a few belly laughs from my homework piece it was a good day ! we very often forget to remind ourselves of all the good stuff in our life it s human nature to dwell on the negative rather than focus on the positive of course , when we linger on the negative talk this only increases the negativity we attract into our daily life my favourite quote is thoughts become things , pick good ones i try to live by this mantra it is possible to retrain your brain to think more positively i wrote a post about the benefits of writing down anything unpleasant and leaving it in a drop box you can read that post here i ve also written several times about the benefits of a gratitude journal writing down your happy thoughts , or successes , on a daily or weekly basis will lift your self esteem when i received praise from my writing class peers and the tutor , i jotted their positive comments in my journal the next time i doubt my abilities i will be able to re read this and boost my confidence have you had a recent success ? it doesn t have to be a huge success i always put a pound coin in a jar when i lose lb it fills me with joy to see the coins mount up as the weight drops off what about receiving a compliment ? do you shrug off a you look lovely today with a don t know why i haven t slept this dress is ancient my hair needs doing whether you choose to write down the good stuff , or simply play it over in your mind before bed , getting into the habit of reminding yourself why you had a good day , will encourage more good days to follow so the next time you re brushing your teeth or taking a shower , think about three things that make you feel grateful start your day with a positive outlook , replaying all the good points from the day before at night , write down all the compliments you received , the successes you created or simple acts of kindness that warmed your heart start every day with a smile how do you ensure that you have a good day ?
