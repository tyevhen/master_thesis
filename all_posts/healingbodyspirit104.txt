on occasion i will have a client with obsessive compulsive disorder who has had a lot of counseling , has sought tons of advice and really knows the things they need to do to change they have read a lot of books and articles on ocd they have gone through a string of counselors seeking help , but nothing changes at times their ocd the compulsive behavior annoys friends , relatives , maybe a spouse and even their therapists they want to change , so why ca n't they change ? their conscious mind knows what to do , but their subconscious mind does n't know or it has not registered people can reason with them they can try to reason with their self , but until it reaches the subconscious mind , it is n't there that is why self hypnosis or hypnosis is good , it reaches the subconscious mind and allows change to take place
