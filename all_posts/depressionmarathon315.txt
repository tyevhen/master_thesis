i'm back home and settled in after five wonderful days in boston with my boyfriend , d we had a great time we enjoyed each other we enjoyed the city and , of course , we enjoyed race day the atmosphere in boston was electric the entire time we were there , but on race day it was amazing it was hard to leave and fly home separately , but now that i'm home , it 's good to be here , too as far as my race , well , it just was n't my day it was boston 's day ! that 's for sure ! i was grateful and proud to be participating the spectator support , all one million of them , was humbling and incredible there were very few quiet spots along the entire mile route unfortunately , all the spectator support in the world could n't keep me from walking at least a portion of each mile after the race 's halfway point i did my best , but my legs were dead and would not respond i ended up standing for nearly minutes prior to the gun going off , and by mile two i knew it was going to be a longer day than i had hoped fortunately , it was a beautiful , sunny day , but the temperature rose a bit beyond predictions the heat may have had an impact on me gi issues , which forced a pit stop at mile four , and lightheadedness also delayed my finish but i did finish i'm proud to have persevered ! after realizing at mile two that my legs were tired and not responsive , i focused on running for as long as i could i first focused on making it to mile ten when i ran through ten , i focused on mile i made that goal , too , so i set my sights on mile fourteen but it was n't to be before i made it to miles i had slowed to a walk from that point on i walked at least a portion of each mile and up every hill i tried to take in as much fuel as i could , but i was simply out of gas i figured i was in for at least a five hour day if it had been any other marathon , at any other time , i would have contemplated dropping out but it was boston , it was the marathon of hope and recovery i not only wanted to help take back the boston marathon , i wanted to take back a large piece of me i thought a lot during those long boston miles i thought about what i had been through recently i thought about five hospitalizations between october and december , i thought about january , , when i began reclaiming my brain , my body , and my running from the ravages of depression i thought about my friends , my family , and the professionals who supported me along the way , many of whom were following my marathon progress from afar i knew i would n't stop i could n't stop i kept moving forward in the end , i averaged a little over nine minutes per mile and crossed the finish line in a respectable i was surprised i must have walked fairly fast ! i had tears in my eyes down the final stretch and was crying by the time i put my fist in the air on the line i did it despite my body 's unwillingness to fully cooperate , i did persevere i did the best i could do on that particular day i'm proud i finished what i started just a few months ago now it 's time to look forward , move ahead , and keep the pace and that 's exactly what i plan to do
