a guest post sent in by caroline having anxiety is like that moment of panic when you miss a step going downstairs , all the time you know what 's about to happen when your heart starts racing and it gets hard to breathe you start shaking , your thoughts get cloudy and suddenly you ca n't see anything clearly anymore some symptoms are huge , like those some symptoms of anxiety are so tiny , like not being able to sit still , eyes always focused on the floor , or not talking in class ever you ask a friend to go with you , everywhere , because the thought of going somewhere by yourself is a task that seems near impossible thoughts of what could happen at any given moment are always racing through your head , making it hard to think , or concentrate on what 's going on around you anxiety is constant fear of what others are thinking , like those people laughing in the hall ? what if they 're laughing at me ? so many what if 's come with this disorder if someone does n't reply right away , you automatically assume they hate you , or want to talk to someone else anxiety can control a human not many things have the power to do that so the people that get up every single day with this disease and carry on acting normal , those people are the strongest out there and the friends and families giving constant support to them are the reason those people can do that so , if you know someone that has this disorder , always walk with them to the checkout at the grocery store , accept their fear of being in public and help push them gently out of their comfort zones and if you have anxiety , tell someone it can make it , times easier to cope with i hope this gives others some understanding of what it 's like living with anxiety it can be so hard but if people can just understand , it could be so much easier caroline
