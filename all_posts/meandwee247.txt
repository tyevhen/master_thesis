hi friends ! well , i 've been away for a bit , eh ? so much has been happening here and it 's been so hard to keep up with it all ! deep breath firstly , thank you so much for your kind words on our last post ! we are pretty pumped about the wee one on the way to answer the many questions i 've gotten i'm currently weeks and days as i write this and feeling good ! our due date is february rd so i'm pretty much assuming an end of january birth i'm finally not feeling sick anymore and my tiredness has lifted enough so that i can function it was baaaaaaad i was pretty much on the couch full time poor little p had a lot to cope with , since she needs a lot of structured play to flourish those harder times are finally behind us though , so onward and upward ! the whole pregnancy was a pleasant and welcome surprise it 's funny we had just decided to wait a few more months to try but lo and behold i found out i was pregnant a mere few days later after that discussion ha ! a true blessing after going through everything we did to bring little p to us not a day goes by that i'm not grateful or shocked by the miracle happening i 'll admit , the first few weeks had me terrified i was worried about how i would handle the sleepless nights with a new baby and still be alert for paige how would i handle paige 's special needs and care for a newborn ? how would it all happen ? ? ? ! ! ! i felt pretty panicked but , as time has gone by i 've relaxed and realized that everything always falls into place as it needs to and we can always try to hire a mother 's helper or something here and there in those first few months if i need a bit of extra sleep in the morning or something time to save up ! ! anyway , now i'm feeling much more calm in other news , which i 'll share more in upcoming posts , is paige is now sleeping in a big girl bed in her new big girl room tear it 's been going wonderfully and has been much easier than i thought it would be i'm still working on finishing up the decorating in there but it 's mostly done i plan to do a post about the bed , and a separate post sharing her new room with you ! the baby will go in paige 's old room we have plans to freshen it up and make it new for the next wee one and on another note we 've made some great strides in meeting paige 's sensory seeking needs and have created some therapy swings from scratch for our own house i plan to do a post with photos of the swings and how we made them in case anyone else is interested i 'll also write about what paige was needing and how the swings satisfy that need and thus help her focus , learn , improve her speech and her motor skills it 's been fascinating to watch we 've been busy ! but it 's a good kind of busy , so i ca n't complain it 's just a lot going on at once and sometimes i feel like i'm buried and flailing around but little p starts her intensive aba floortime therapy today with her new facilitators so i'm going to start having more free time on my hands to get things done around the house and maybe start creating art again silver lining ! ! ! thank you again for your well wishes and we are doing well ! thanks for those who have asked or who were concerned looks like i will finally have some more time to do some proper posting around here ! yay ! be well ! ! ! save you might also like weeks weeks weeks linkwithin
