you can give jack credit for this very umm , creative title john and i dug in today and worked on the ot space we have been planning for the boys the swing i bought on craigslist literally came over night , we already have a trampoline and a sand and water table to put beans in today i found a gym mat for on craigslist i will probably want a second one at some point , but it 's a great start first we had to clear out the front of the garage , which was a mess this took about an hour and a half then i went over to the kids' private ot office and inspected their swing set up between that and some very excellent pictures of a swivel hook by meghan gallagher houder , we were in business brave woman that i am , i went to the hardware store and found all of the stuff bought the lb load bearing variety i know the boys are tiny but the swing is moving and gravity is at play , so i did n't want to take any chances and voila , now we are cooking with gas the only downside was that the boys were fighting over the swing this afternoon which is a good downside i suppose the trampoline had been buried in the garage for awhile nathan went right over to it and had a blast working on his jumping even though he does this every week at ot , he previously hated the trampoline at our house he would pretty much climb under it and lie there looking at the netting if i tried to put him on it he would scream so that 's progress for sure as for the new swing smell ? here you go where this came from we have no idea ! it 's not even a quote unless someone has been showing him secret new swing smell videos ? yeah , no
