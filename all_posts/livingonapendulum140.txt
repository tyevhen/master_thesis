well i do n't have much to say today , mind you i did n't have all that much to say yesterday either , i was so tired as those of you who read yesterday 's post might have been able to tell that i decided to steal the idea of a friend of mine and customize it the best chick flicks , according to me for the original post http feliciamaystevenson blogspot com what makes a good chick flick ? i like to have a good dose of humour in my love stories keep in mind that humour is not mandatory , as you will see below must the guy be a hunk ? man no , i do n't find some of the guys from my favorite movies to be hunks billy cristal but the personality just makes up for it if the guy can do something amazing for her , build a house , travel in time , write letters from the grave even better ! i have a really hard time figuring out levels of best , like the number best , so i just want to enumerate a bunch of great chick flicks i 've seen without trying to grade them so here goes the proposal ryan reynolds and sandra bullock the older woman and the younger man , and what a man it is ! the underling winds up having some power and a b tch becomes human and lovable i love when she is chanting with betty white in the forest priceless ! ps i love you gerard butler and hilary swank not much funny in here , it actually made me cry there are moments of cuteness for sure , like when he is protecting her from the fierce will dog i also like when she kisses her longtime friend and they discover there is no chemistry i do but i do n't dean caine and denise richards a divorced wedding planner who falls for the groom to be this movie was made for tv , yet i still included as a good chick flick first dean caine is hot second , there was a lot of comedy in this movie , many moments of tension and a great finale the notebook ryan gosling and rachel mac adams this movie needs no introduction , i do n't think there is anymore on the northern hemisphere who is not aware of it he builds a house for her and that line it 's still not over swoon now ever since i saw ryan gosling in young hercules , i will never be able to summon hormones for him , but this movie came close wedding date dermot mulroney and debra messing a single woman hires an escort to accompany her to a wedding to make an ex jealous he teaches her all about romance and sensuality and of course he totally falls for her lots of funny moments , debra is a hoot when harry met sally billy cristal and meg ryan harry and sally meet when she gives him a ride to new york after they both graduate from the university of chicago the film jumps through their lives as they both search for love , but fail , bumping into each other time and time again finally a close friendship blooms between them , and they both like having a friend of the opposite sex but then they are confronted with the problem can a man and a woman be friends , without sex getting in the way ?
