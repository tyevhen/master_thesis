it was kind of a big week around here seven days ago i ran my first race in months , days , and it went well i was thrilled to be back racing i was happy with the result and i was grateful to do it without re injuring my achilles it was a long , long time coming i'm so glad i was able to persevere on thursday , i jumped out of an airplane from , feet , and fell through the air at miles per hour for seconds , before floating back to earth the experience was more amazing than i can put into words it was everything i had hoped for and so much more ! i 've wanted to skydive since i was years old it was a bucket list item , but i can honestly say i have n't completely crossed it off the list i will definitely do it again ! and if i can swing it , i plan to go through the training to jump on my own i did add a link to the video of my jump at the end of my previous post i 've watched it , and re lived the experience , about times myself i rarely give advice here , but if you 've ever considered jumping , just do it ! you wo n't regret it my seven day stretch of big events ended today with a mile training run it was my first miler in years it was n't one of my best it was , actually , really hard i even considered cutting it short at miles i worked a lot of hours this week , including almost yesterday , and i think my legs were tired nevertheless , i pulled out my perseverance card and played it i kept going it took me almost hours and minutes to get back home , including about pit stops or water stops for both jet and i , but my actual running time was only hours , which is minutes per mile , so i'm satisfied i'm glad i continued running even though it was n't easy life , like running , is n't always easy do n't we all know that ? as simplistic as that sounds , i do think my experiences hanging tough in training help me hang tough when faced with life 's challenges , too , whether the challenges come from my work , my health , my finances or my illness speaking of my illness , my mood has improved significantly the med changes we made a couple of weeks ago have certainly made a difference racing , jumping out of an airplane , and running miles probably helped a bit , too it was kind of a big , successful week around here and i had fun how cool is that ? carry on , my friends
