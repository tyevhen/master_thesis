vitamin d what a roller coaster there 's the vitamin d council telling you to aim for a level of ng ml , and then the institutes of medicine rather grumpily suggest is sufficient with a monstrous report no one has time to read except chris masterjohn vitamin d council says no risk of toxicity below chris kresser , paul jaminet , and kurt harris talk about lack of randomized controlled trials and suggest somewhere between as a good range depending on the expert and depending on your skin color , and there is risk of kidney stones , calcification , and premature aging at higher levels as i am a very pale woman , and i have looked at a bit of the pregnancy and cancer literature , i tend to think , hey , pale pregnant women might do better a bit above , caucasian women should aim for , and everyone else , is probably a good range but kurt makes a good point in his podcast with chris kresser the oh vitamin d level we al measure is still indirect , oh vitamin d is the active hormone , but its metabolism is tightly regulated and levels are rarely out of a narrow range no matter how deficient we are so who knows what a low serum level of oh vitamin d actually means in local areas , such as the brain , or in scanning for cancer cells in other sequestered areas of the body i do n't know if i really have much of a horse in this race , though , as the data for mental health is scanty , to say the least but the theory is sound for vitamin d to play a prominent role in mental health , as it interacts with stress hormones and nerve growth and repair , and seems especially active in those areas of the brain associated with mood , appetite , and sleep the hippocampus and hypothalamus australian researchers have been valiantly paving the way in single megadoses in seniors for years now in the vital d study , women over living in the community were recruited from voting rolls which is compulsory in australia women were included in the study if they had a high risk of hip fracture or previous hip fracture , osteoporosis , or high risk of low vitamin d levels for several years , they were given a single dose of , iu vit d or placebo in easy to swallow capsules once each year in the autumn or winter , and several measures were followed along the way one of the measures , more fractures , proved that standing on the sun once yearly is not a terrific way to prevent them the active group getting the vitamin d had significantly more fractures and falls and then there is depression it was a lot of people , so the typical short scales were used the ghq questionnaire i already blew the punch line in the title the active group had no significant difference from the placebo group in the amount of depression or change of depression with the huge bolus of vitamin d let 's look more closely the average vitamin d level for all the women at the beginning of the study was about nmol l ng ml about nmol l , so the more typical oh vit d level measurement i'm used to seeing is ng ml for the most part , the women in the active arm had vitamin d levels higher than the placebo arm , with a level of nmol l ng ml after dosing , and nmol l ng ml after months and the discussion , which is typically the most interesting part the association between vitamin d and mental health is inconsistent epidemiology shows a correlation between low levels of vitamin d and depression in a small fibromyalgia study , mood and fibromyalgia symptoms were not related to vitamin d levels before or after supplementation , even in those with vitamin d deficiency in another month study of older women receiving iu vit d and mg calcium daily , depression scores did not improve compared to placebo in another group of folks receiving , iu vit d vs phototherapy for seasonal affective disorder , vit d was a clear winner in another study of obese individuals , , , vit d per week for a year showed a beneficial effect on depressive symptoms , though those with a baseline level nmol l ng ml had no benefit how to pull it all together ? well , , oh vitamin d , the active form , definitely has a role in the central nervous system in neurogeneration and repair however , the cns may have a separate conversion system from oh vit d than the rest of the body evidence from a study i blogged about earlier suggests maybe a u shaped curve is applicable neonates with the lowest and highest amounts of vitamin d had the highest risk of schizophrenia later in life it is probably safe to say that giving year old women massive doses of vitamin d once a year is a bad idea bones and mental state accounted for clinical studies of vitamin d in clinical populations with documented insufficiency remain warranted and , indeed , at no time in history would we ever have been exposed to , iu vitamin d in a single day my personal clinical experience ? a lot i 'd say to of people who come to see me have horrible vitamin d levels i live in the far north of the us , but it is not uncommon for levels of ng ml to show up on my initial tests , with the lowest i have seen being i would have to say , sunshine and or vitamin d supplementation depending upon the season has perked up my clinical population over a timeframe of , say , months at the same time we have implemented other interventions nutrition , therapy , medication , so who knows what made the difference is vitamin d the end all , be all missing link to the question of crappy modern health and modern disease ? no does it play a role ? most likely but you ca n't overdose on vitamin d via sunshine , and you sure can via megasupplements vitamin d is a hormone that sticks around for a while , not something to muck around with willy nilly i supplemented this winter , as i was low i 'll make every effort to soak up the rays all summer will i supplement next winter ? probably not
