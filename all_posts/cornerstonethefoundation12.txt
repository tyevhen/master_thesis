if suffering from depression , it is common to be troubled by particular irrational fearful thoughts that come back time and again until they become a mental obsession when these obsessive fears confront us , a mental battle of epic proportions ensues as we examine , debate and work through them in a vain attempt to find relief and release this process can take hours , days , or longer this is not surprising , as our mind is so exhausted that it has lost the flexibility of a healthy mind , which could dismiss such irrational fears out of hand try as we might , we cannot shake free of these fears and in the end , we can no longer see them from any other perspective we lose the ability to differentiate between what we fear , and what is real , and come to believe that the fearful perspective is the only perspective i finally found the courage to share some of my irrational fears with the christian lady who was counselling me , and she gently helped me to see such fearful thoughts from another perspective the true perspective at first , i could not feel the truth of a new perspective , but i accepted it , and kept it in my mind and when those fears returned , instead of going through the exhausting process of trying to work through them again , i recalled the new perspective given me by my counsellor , and accepted it and believed it i then learned to live with the fearful thoughts simmering away at the back of my mind , without fearing or fighting them , while continually reminding myself of the new perspective and as i let time pass , the new perspective , the truth , finally won out sometimes we can embrace the new perspective quickly , but if severely depressed , it can be some time before the truth sinks in , and when it does , we receive relief and freedom then you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free john in the book self help for your nerves , dr weekes explains the importance of finding someone suitable to help us find 'the other point of view ' let it be your wisest and not just your nearest friend if you have no such friend , find a suitable minister , priest or doctor p a professional therapist health care worker is of course another possibility the lady who counselled me had experienced and overcome depression , and understood what i was going through to help me with this process of learning to see and embrace new perspectives , i wrote each new perspective on the back of a business card or scrap of paper , which i kept in my pocket or wallet and when that fear reared its ugly head again , i pulled out the card and read it as i continued to recover from depression , i was able to work through such fears and find the new perspective myself , with the assistance of prayer and god 's word in many of these cases , i continued to write the new perspectives on flashcards this saved me a lot of mental anguish of trying to work through things again that i had already worked through in the past here is an example of finding a new perspective regarding a very powerful fear i had the misfortune of having a car crash while recovering from severe depression my exhausted mind , already struggling with anxiety , was swamped by fears that assured me i was going to have heaps of car crashes , starting with the loan car , and then in every car i got in for the next two weeks , regardless of whose car it was these fears were so fresh and powerful that they felt real remembering what i had learned , i sought the new perspective to have towards this irrational fear , and this was these thoughts that say i am going to have lots of car crashes are not real these thoughts are not what is going to happen , they are only what i am afraid is going to happen jesus said to let not my heart be troubled , but trust in god and in him john therefore i will get in these cars and trust him to keep me safe psalm and regarding the fears that i was going to suffer many car crashes over those two weeks , this is what i wrote in my diary afterwards nothing happened all verses from the niv
