i was wondering again the other day whether all these labels put on me and the medication switching was real or not i have never really though about when i have had clear bouts of hypomania they usually pass so smoothly aqnd efficiently i only recognise i have been high after the event i thought of this example the week before i moved , the more i think about it the more i believe it is not something most people do it was a sunday and i had to do some work to do , it was also the weekend before i moved so i had to get a certain amount of to be packing done to start off with i dithered a lot and flicked between one task and then the other , but then i had an idea and set the kitchen timmer i did minutes of packing followed by minutes of work i was so efficient throughout the day i managed to get everything done my mind just managed to switch on command , everything was so clear and under control it was like the usuall anxiety and lack of confidence and fear of failing , then super efficiency kicked in and everything worked like clock work it was great
