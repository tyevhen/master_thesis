with a title like that , i'm amazed you 're reading this sentence but blah is how i 've been feeling i do n't want to do much of anything , which explains why i have n't written in a few days i think the gray weather is really getting to me we did have some sun yesterday , but otherwise nothing but gray gray is exhausting i did run this weekend miles yesterday and more today i should be proud of that , especially since i am nursing another injury which kept me off the road days this week i have some tendinitis in my right shin area it hurts , but not enough that i was n't able to push through it yesterday and today of course i may not be able to walk tomorrow kidding i 'll be fine so i do n't have much to say today blah does not lend itself to verbosity , and i do n't want to turn everyone off with my whining anyway i'm not a big fan of whining this too shall pass right ?
