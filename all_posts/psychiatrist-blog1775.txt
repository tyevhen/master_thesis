or why i do n't do custody cases anymore a friend of mine desparately needed a night out on the town recently so last night we did it , a group of us each in our own various stages of life i heard about past marriages or more than one current boyfriends , behaviors that make up the why in the y chromosome , children , teenagers , laundry and discipline or lack of it by the end of the evening i came home feeling somewhat guilty that my life was so peaceful and relieved that i just did n't have to deal with any of that it brought back memories of doing court ordered child custody evaluations keep in mind that over the years i 've interviewed and worked with psychotic killers , rapists , drug kingpins , death row inmates , mafia figures and various other low level criminal types i 'll take them any day over a disgruntled non custodial parent now , most divorces do n't end up in court ordered custody evaluations the majority of people with kids split up , talk or shout amongst themselves and generally figure out what they need to do and when to do it without any court involvement other than a rubber stamp those were n't the cases i got by definition , by the time a case came to me the couple had already been through one hearing , or three , as well as emergency motions for visitation and or custody , domestic violence petitions , protective orders , social services investigations and or criminal charges these were not easy cases over time i learned that all the allegations back and forth could generally be boiled down to four or five categories allegations of abuse or neglect physical or sexual , drug use , domestic violence , mental illness or something i call generic lifestye differences non custodial mother alleges that father dresses daughter in age inappropriate clothing so she looks like a biker chick while custodial father complains that mother wants daughter in black patent leather shoes with white anklets or mother alleges that father is a lying psychopath with sexual interests in their teenage babysitter or father really has been convicted of multiple felonies and the interview alone is enough to get you thinking about the distance between yourself and the nearest security alarm in memory of kurt vonnegut so it goes one must fight the temptation to toss the child to the nearest passing stranger the fathers i interview assume that because i'm a woman i will naturally side with the mother the mothers assume that because i'm a woman i will naturally agree with their childrearing tactics and the fact that all men are rats and they all want to know whether or not i have kids i do n't being childless is an advantage in these situations i am not saddled with my own personal shtick of past marriages or three , domestic violence and childrearing issues and if being a biological parent had anything to do with good parenting skills we would n't need these evaluations to begin with the children are the most honest ones of everybody involved in the litigation my ears would always perk up at any sentence out of their mouths that began my mother wanted me to tell you they were honest even about their coaching i was also surprised by some of the things the parents admitted quizzing a child in detail about the other parents' sex life , plans to take the child and run , attempts to undermine the child 's medical or mental health care sometimes the main goal of the evaluation was just to make sure the child did n't disappear or die in the process of growing up the fact of the matter is that there is no litmus test for being a good parent in spite of the thousands of dollars being paid to private forensic evaluators , not the court employed folks for interviews and psychological testing , no psychological test can tell you which parent is best for which kid and the answer may be different for each individual child even when the same parents are involved a child who is unpredicatable , emotionally labile and impulsive may do best with the parent who is patient , stable and consistent while the shy , slow to warm up child needs an extroverted parent regardless , most kids are pretty resilient and they grow up to be normal responsible folks in spite of the craziness between their parents i just hope they manage their own custody issues as well when they 're adults
