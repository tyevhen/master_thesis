stephanie saul has a quite interesting story in the new york times about a peer reviewer who really dropped the ball a key member of the senate said wednesday that a prominent diabetes expert leaked an unpublished and confidential medical journal article to glaxosmithkline last year , tipping the company to the imminent publication of safety questions involving the company s diabetes drug avandia the doctor , steven m haffner of the university of texas health science center in san antonio , faxed the article to the drug maker after agreeing to read it as part of the peer review process for the new england journal of medicine , according to a statement wednesday by senator charles e grassley an article on the matter that was published online wednesday by the journal nature quoted dr haffner why i sent it is a mystery , the quote says i don t really understand it i wasn t feeling well it was bad judgment ok , i have to give haffner credit for admitting his error however , i was n't feeling well not a great excuse according to a gsk spokesperson , haffner sent the article to gsk for advice from experienced statisticians the spokesperson denied that gsk provided any feedback to haffner um , could n't haffner have found a statistician who did not work for gsk ? as you might guess , this type of behavior is a no no the new england journal of medicine as well as virtually all journals has a policy where peer reviewers are not to share the content of papers under peer review with others why did haffner go to gsk ? well , here 's one possible reason dr haffner has previously disclosed that he has conducted research and served as a paid speaker for glaxo iowa senator mr grassley said that dr haffner had received , in consulting and speaking fees from glaxosmithkline since maybe it was his relationship with gsk , maybe not haffner is apparently not a fan of medical journals , as can be seen in the quote below the three major medical journals are becoming more like british tabloid newspapers all they lack is a bare chested woman on page , apparently if they changed their peer review process to include submitting papers critical of industry for objective peer review by precisely the companies they are criticizing , that would help to de tabloid the journals ? ? at the end of the article , saul notes a case of limp noodle punishment for a similar violation last year the new england journal sanctioned another physician , dr martin b leon , for commenting on a study before its publication dr leon , who was a reviewer of a journal article on the effectiveness of heart stents , disclosed at a medical conference that the study s findings were negative before the article appeared as a result , the journal barred dr leon from reviewing articles for five years , and said he could not submit commentary for publication in the journal during that period oh , that will teach him a lesson ! he ca n't spend his free time reviewing articles for a journal ouch , that might leave a mark and he ca n't publish an editorial for five years in one journal ? ? with hundreds of other journals to choose from , how will he survive ? see some interesting comments on the leon case here hat tip furious seasons
