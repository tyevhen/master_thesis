i 've written before about the tendency for technology to result in lower paying jobs job deskilling was a major factor in the first industrial revolution when skilled artisans were displaced into menial , repetitive factory jobs and is just as important in today 's technological revolution , which began sometime in the late s with the widespread availability of computer chips i 've written about this trend quite a few times before if you teach a robot to fish the technological roots of income inequality the internet has killed prosperity as we know it the driverless economy why the super rich get richer in a macroeconomic sense , it all sounds quite theoretical , but the following photograph provides a great real world case study of how , exactly , deskilling works the tiger stone paving machine , sometimes called the road printer , can lay down a lovely , herringboned brick road or walkway at to times the speed of a crew of skilled bricklayers the machine is available in , , and ft widths and costs from , to , and best of all for buyers , it requires no skilled bricklayers oh sure , you still need human attendants to feed bricks into the pusher slot but they obviously do n't have to be highly skilled artisans so this might seem like a pretty small incursion of technology into the lives of a few bricklayers and who cares about bricklayers , right ? i mean , we 're so beyond bricklaying i'm being sarcastic , of course , but this is just one example of a trend that plays out in a million different ways across the economy every day new tech shows up jobs get a little dumber , require a few less skills wages go down productivity jumps profits increase wealth gets transferred , from workers to owners repeat until systemic collapse a big thank you to all the great people who retweeted me yesterday buy my books or click to find out more , at least have you added your name to our mailing list ? thank you be well
