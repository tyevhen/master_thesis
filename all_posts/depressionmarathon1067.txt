another weird , tough day today i'm just feeling out of sorts restless , irritable and discontent to quote the big book i hate feeling like this i'm full of this jittery , let 's go energy , yet i'm tired i want to sleep the day away , but ca n't seems like i 'd have energy to accomplish a lot , but i basically end up pacing unable to focus on anything and with patience for nothing this is not a great place to be it 's weird i do n't like it my therapist , per usual , tells me it will pass it 's temporary and i know that but it feels icky right now icky good word i think the word icky must have been created for times like these i'm not sure i'm even making sense i ca n't put into words it 's just icky does that mean anything to anyone out there ? well , despite the icky ness , i did get some stuff done i made it to yoga this morning , and i ran my first short speed workout late this afternoon i'm really frustrated with how heavy i feel , and apparently am if the jeans i tried on today run true to size ! ughhh i'm frustrated with craving crap , which seems to coincide with icky ness , although eating crap certainly does n't help ! so i guess i'm frustrated and icky but where was i ? oh , yes , i was focusing on the positive ! it 's so easy to get off track when feeling restless , irritable and discontent i yoga ed i ran i went to therapy i got out grocery shopping for some good , fresh food , and i made it to a meeting so the day was not a loss i still feel icky , but at least busying myself kept the pacing to a minimum here 's hoping tomorrow 's a better day !
