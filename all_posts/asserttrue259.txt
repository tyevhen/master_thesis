lately i 've been using the great tools at genomevolution org plus custom canvas api scripts to render colorful heatmaps of aligned genes from phylogeneticaly diverse microorganisms the following graphic is one such glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase genes of n bacterial species , arranged in order of gene g c content high gc at the top hot colors are g and c cool colors are a and t what are we looking at ? this is actually a composite rendering of the glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase genes dna sequence info from bacterial species each gene is painted left to right ' to ' in a strip pixels tall , with hot colors assigned to dna bases g and c guanine and cytosine , and cool colors assigned to bases a and t adenine and thymine wherever there 's a g or c , it gets painted red or red orange wherever there 's a or t , blue or blue green same gene , versions , varying significantly in g c content the gene gc content ranges from a maximum of at the top to at the bottom why glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh ? no real reason , except that it 's a fairly universal indeed , quite ancient metabolic enzyme , reasonably compact making possible a rendering that 's not super wide , as it would be for a larger gene , well delineated genetically not a fusion protein or an enzyme with multiple isoforms , and probably representative of a good many core metabolic enzymes this is the enzyme that catalyzes the sixth step of glycolysis sugar breakdown you may recall from biochem that the breakdown of glucose proceeds by splitting the twice phosphorylated molecule into two carbon pieces the triose phosphates in turn get phosphorylated by gapdh before they transfer a phosphate to adp to yield atp , the hour energy drink of all cells everywhere alignment of genes was done via clustalw in mega freeware rendering of the alignment fasta file took about two seconds , in the browser , using lines of custom javascript
