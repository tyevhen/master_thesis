first , thanks to all who have been taking this journey with me , friends too numerous to mention and family , of course all the great e mails i 've received are not shown as comments here at the blog , regrettably know that if you do post here , the comment is automatcally forwarded to me by e mail by posting her others can enjoy your remarks as well now for today 's poem countermeasures like a stiff current applied to the solar plexus life fucks with us if you do not read psychology as a horoscope of self congratulation , you are ill ask your pastor suffering builds character or your therapist let 's work through this psychology encourages confessions but prescribes defenses better protect yourself today the speaker achieves anger , an important prognostic sign in coming out of a depression it 's better to be angry than sad , because anger energizes and sadness paralyzes besides , anger feels better here the speaker draws a necessary boundary for self preservation , with a dose of cynicism towards easy explanations and cures those unfamiliar with mood disorders often blithely advise in other words , screw dr phil ! ce
