i have a situation of course , by situation i mean a boy to be matter of fact , i actually have a date a first date first dates are odd are n't they ? a bit like a job interview really 'what do you do ? ' 'do you have any hobbies ? ' 'where do you see yourself in five years ? ' the first date is a job interview where neither one of you want to be seen to overly want to get both applicants are cool and aloof about the job on offer of course not all job interviews , er i mean first dates , go this way sometimes you come across applicants who are mega keen i 've interviewed a few who have been very clear of what they want out of the job in question , namely a wife and kids obviously that kind of directness is off putting , well to me anyway i guess even in a real life job interview the sucker uppers never get through to the second stage it 's the ones who have that perfect balance of skill , attitude and confidence this leads me to consider if first date games are an absolute necessary part of the dating process perhaps we need a bit of aloofness and lets pretend i do n't even fancy you to keep things interesting and fun perhaps if two people met up in a swanky bar , ordered a couple of drinks and opened the chitchat with 'i really fancy you , will you be my boyfriend' the whole concept of dating would be ruined this comes as a challenge to me i am a heart on your sleeve kind of gal i tell everyone my secrets , i'm as honest as a nun dating games are difficult this time however i am going to play perhaps i need to attack this situation like a would with a job i'm pretty sure this was my downfall last time but oh well i think i want this job , i just need to find out a bit more about the , ahem , package what are the benefits ? is there a lot of opportunity ? what 's the probationary period like ? so my strategy looks a bit like this aloof i will not confess my interest in this job , i mean boy , oh no i mean game , oh god i have no idea i will be cool as a cue , keep my distance , leave him guessing observe whilst being my very unnaturally aloof self , i will sit back and look out for the iois you remember my fpua days right ? i need to keep sight of what his intensions which leads me on to my third and final rule a sex ban that 's right kids , no sex it wo n't be easy but it 's going to happen i always fall in love with the guys i have sex with i'm a passionate gal , i do n't just have sex for sex sake , it 's emotional for me so that 's it my current situation will be battled with me acting like a do n't care , whilst tying to find out if he does and keeping my legs shut sounds to me like i have this job in the bag
