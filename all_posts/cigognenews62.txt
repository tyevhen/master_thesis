we are specialists of joy , not pain primal therapy is no quick fix we are attempting to redo someone s entire life it will be done in a slow methodical manner so as to never overwhelm the patient and make him suffer all over again , as happens with abreaction if he can experience just enough to have a full experience that is enough for a session we do not want him to suffer any more than necessary he will suffer when the pain comes up arbitrarily , prematurely so that he cannot integrate it the pain hangs there in an ego dystonic fashion freud again , meaning alien and apart with pure pain that cannot be made ego syntonic or integrated so why do we have to trace back our evolution again ? one reason is that we never sever anything permanently in our evolution we suppress the old and add on the new sometimes the primal pain vestige is so powerful that it exerts a constant force that disrupts our functioning in my patois , the first line erupts and surges higher then it has to be dealt with and relived i call it intrusion , an imprint so strong that it interferes with our personal evolution and our current functioning we see it in physical symptoms and deformation of organs and growth we see it in diseases such as hypertension , cancer and heart failure that are actually offshoots of the central damaging memory , locked in as an imprint , out of reach and out of touch this is also the case with attention deficit disorder where forceful imprints constantly surge toward the top level to disrupt concentration and attention processes remember , earlier , i explained that evolution always moves the imprint higher so that first line damage may be expressed on the upper levels of brain function , where attention and concentration are mustered training a person how to concentrate is not the answer feeling the force that scatters thoughts is the answer once we lift the repressive lid done in orderly fashion there is no longer unconscious forces driving behavior and symptoms and as repression lifts , the patient s truth becomes self revealing bit by bit his unconscious tells him what he needs to know , but not too much , just enough to integrate the pain and its information his orderly descent into feelings eventually informs him of what it all means everything he needs to learn is already lying inside of him , waiting for discovery it must come from inside , never outside , just as the feelings were laid down by the system and not by executive order the aim is not insights it is change in all aspects of the person his behavior , biochemistry , neurology and feelings we are after total change because there was total change at the time of the imprints we want normalization of the whole person we are not there to give love we are there , paradoxically , to help patients feel unloved so that they recapture the ability to feel and then can feel love when it is there if a therapist needs to be loved he will act out on the patient and give him what he , the therapist , never got he has become a pal not his doctor the patient feels loved , it feels good and he loses ! or there are great discussions about music and art and politics , and the patient becomes an intellectual pal , and again he loses he has been transformed from a patient who needs treatment into a good friend nice idea but very wrong we are not there to give love we offer kindness and caring but also science we don t replace science with pseudo caring we adhere to key principles the patient begins to suffer we do not rush in to stop it and make him feel better we don t do him any favors suffocating the pain with love his feelings are about real suffering it must not be tampered with that is the part he has kept hidden for years it must come out and be experienced then we will be free free of that pain which has made him depressed or anxious for so long the patient is himself at last it is dialectic he has to feel unloved so as to unlock the feeling gates he will never do that with therapeutic approval and warmth and understanding he will get that after the feeling , not before when he has made a breakthrough , we rejoice with him it is not just about pain it is about contentment , ease and relaxation it is about joy it is what we want too for them why else do the therapy ? i received over fifty letters on my birthday thanking me and my staff for saving their lives or improving them greatly that is the reward and the meaning of our lives we are not pain specialists we are joy specialists who need pain to help joy along there is a reason the patient has to feel unloved he needs to go back to the open sensory window when unloved dominated that is the essence of our therapy travelling back in time and undoing the original damage we cannot do any better than that
