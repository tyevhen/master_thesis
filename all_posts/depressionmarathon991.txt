another tired , tough day except for the time spent in the doctor and dentist offices , i spent most of the day in bed my first appointment of the day was with my psychiatrist guess what we discussed ? yup , fatigue i'm so tired , i even agreed to give another anti fatigue med a try if you 've been following along , you know that i quit taking the previous stimulating med because it elevated my pulse and made running virtually impossible i quit that drug in december , and by spring my resting pulse rate had dropped from bpm to around bpm it 's no coincidence that my running improved significantly this year as well my doc and i are hoping this drug , a cousin of the original , will cure the fatigue and wo n't have the same side effect please , god , let that be so !
