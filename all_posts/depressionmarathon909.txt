this is a great time of year to be a football fan if i wanted , i could watch a game just about every day of the week saturdays are full of college games , and then i get to watch my awesome vikings on sundays today , i went to my morning aa meeting , which was quite good as usual after the meeting i went swimming for minutes before i came home to relax in front of some great football games ! sixty five minutes of swimming is boring , but i covered miles again mile with flippers i think wearing the flippers is strengthening my ankles and shins that 's exactly what i need to keep this tendinitis from coming back once i resume running my left leg is pain free now , but i have n't tried to run yet i think i will get back on the road by mid week i still have n't heard anything about puck 's biopsy the vet thought we 'd have results by now it 's hard to wait i pray there is nothing wrong with him he 's certainly not acting ill , but i know that does n't always mean anything he 's so bored with me not running he 'll be thrilled when i start running again ! well , i do n't have much more to say i'm grateful to be feeling well now , back to the game
