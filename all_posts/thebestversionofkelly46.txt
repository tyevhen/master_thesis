i started with just the items from the set then added in some other items for interest before taking some from alternative angles these were my favourite three health i was busier than normal last week and on monday i did some shopping the primark haul by tuesday i was feeling i had over done it fatigue wise so , i had a resting day the benefit of now blogging is i can still do something constructive from the sofa or even bed and that s great as keeping busy helps control my depression and anxiety by thursday i was back to a manageable level of fatigue sadly , i had to deal with some stress on thursday , it currently wouldn t be professional of me to disclose the details but it disrupted my sleep drastically on thursday night so friday was another challenging day looking tired even with make up this week !

exercise i am following an exercise plan my friend sent me , you pick one cardio , one leg , one arm and one core exercise and do a minute of each i decided to start with seconds of each and will up this to seconds next week so far , i have only tried one exercise from each group so will be trying more of those next week too the yoga class i do is a kid s class where the parents join in too it s so much fun , we love it i often notice my lack of fitness during the class though ! i was going to list some days as no exercise but decided rest day sounded more professional i hope these comments come across as tongue in cheek like intended ! i m fairly active anyway as most mums are , what with school runs we walk , housework , ironing etc i won t list those though just the more conventional exercise , and yes shopping counts as exercise , thank you very much i got my husband to take some pics of me doing some of the exercises to show you seriously not easy to get flattering photos and i kept laughing ! i do n't always bother changing into these clothes to do them , one time i did n't even take my slippers off i'm not wearing make up in the pictures , i was going to until my year old daughter said 'mummy if you 're doing a blog to show people you then why not show them how you really look ? ' how right could she be ? i was very proud of that comment and want her to keep that outlook so no make up i just typed , excuse the lack of make up but deleted it because it 's dumb i feel the need to excuse that at all ! anyway back to exercise diary friday rd march rest day saturday th march walk twice around the local path i will try and calculate the distance for next time ! sunday th march yoga class with the kids and seconds of squats , leg raises , press ups on knees and knee raises monday th march shopping it counts ! tuesday th march rest day wednesday th march seconds of squats , leg raises , press ups on knees and knee raises thursday th march seconds of squats , leg raises , press ups on knees and knee raises goals for next week less diet cheats more exercise and vary types less stress and better sleep publish blog posts enjoy my first blogging event and try not to get to anxious beforehand summary no life updates as it s been a fairly run of the mill week and i have been at home a lot i am pleased with my progress with my healthy eating and exercise , i feel it has been a good start my fatigue has been worse than normal on at least three days this week which is disappointing but i think to be expected initially my anxiety and depression have been generally manageable i have enjoyed working on the blog this week remember to come back for next week s diary and there should be at least two further posts next week too if you don t want to miss one , then subscribe to the blog by email thank you kelly x suggested posts my journey to healthy eating my exercise history or lack of my cfs story and tips for managing
