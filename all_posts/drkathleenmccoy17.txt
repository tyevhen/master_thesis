it was wizened with age , scarred from historic battles and lying by the doorway of a popular take out rib joint the big orange cat barely glanced at us as we approached but when bob reached down to let it sniff his hand , the cat responded warmly , rubbing and purring then it walked over to me , collapsing on my right foot and embracing my ankles with both soft paws it looked up at me and purred as i reached down to pet it and it made my day just as when an old and very dear friend writes a email filled with warm encouragement a stranger reaches out a hand to help one climb a high curb a child on the beach looks up from digging in the sand with the gift of a radiant smile a friend 's dog wants to cuddle a snail mail letter arrives from a someone special , standing out amid all the junk mail and bills a faint wisp of a memory makes one smile a lovely moment of connection happens with an acquaintance on the way to becoming a friend a spontaneous hug just when you need it the most someone treasured and dear says i love you ! there are so many moments that bring such blessings to our lives and today my blessing was a sweet orange cat lounging on the stoop of the rib joint its sweetness and affection was such a joy it may have simply been hoping for a share of our upcoming take out order but i prefer to think that this elderly orange cat was an angel of sorts , blessing us with a moment of pure happiness and reminding us that love and beauty are abundant in so many small moments of our lives
