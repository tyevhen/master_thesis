you probably know that steve irwin , the crocodile hunter , was killed this past weekend by a sting ray in the course of filming a show what you may not know is that dr wayne fenton , a schizophrenia researcher at the national institutes of mental health , was killed this weekend by a schizophrenic patient he was seeing in his private office i did n't know dr fenton , i do n't think i even knew of him , but i learned of his death at a labor day barbeque i hosted , from one of my neighbors who is also a schizophrenia researcher and who did know him my husband asked me last night , do n't you worry about being alone in your office with patients ? i do n't there 's only so much i can worry about , and for the most part , my patients constitute a rather tame crew my husband says that when he lets himself think about it , he does worry about me even if i do n't wrestle with crocs for a living , the reality remains that people with psychosis can behave in unpredictable ways as a child , i lived across the street from a neurologist his office was across the hall from a psychiatrist and one day , a patient walked in and shot and killed the psychiatrist needless to say , my mother thought i should consider another career i once briefly treated a patient who was preoccupied with thoughts of killing his former psychiatrist and who had previously been banished from a local psychiatric institution for threatening psychiatrists there he was psychotic , bizarre , violent , and needy after a few months , i sought consultation and , as a result of this , told the patient i would not continue to see him in my office the consultant had suggested that it was too intimate and secluded a setting but that i would be happy to see him at the clinic where i work the hours i'm at that clinic conflict with the hours this patient worked , so while i made the offer , i knew it would n't fly when i told the patient , he became angry and began pacing around my office and making threatening gestures i went into the hallway , and to get him to leave , i had to have the police come he phoned later and wished me a doomed future perhaps the closest anyone has ever come to the f off rule shp talks about in her post today foofoo added to shp 's comments with a horrifying story of how he 'd been assaulted , bitten , and broken by a violent patient he 'd pulled off an intern i'm impressed by his bravery , saddened for both of them at the violation i'm not so sure i could have gone on working at least not in that setting in the face of such horrors i did n't know dr fenton this story is n't really mine to tell but from the perspective of a fellow psychiatrist who is left to wonder a bit about issues of safety , and to feel badly for my neighbor who is distraught my heart goes out to dr fenton 's family and friends , and somehow this all feels a bit closer to home than the other stories i 've heard this weekend dr fenton remembered across the blogs
