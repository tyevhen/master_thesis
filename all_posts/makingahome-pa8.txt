we finished the living room to the point where we could get the furniture all put back in place we still need to attend to a few details such as face plates , wall decor , and curtains , but i'm giving the paint another day or so to cure i 've learned that lesson the hard way in the past we were going to start the kitchen and dining area over the weekend , but we decided to take a much needed family break and spend some time resting and playing this week is going to be broken up a bit due to some traveling , so we 're going to hit the kitchen hard next week and tackle everything at one time i'm currently hem hawing around regarding the paint color of our kitchen cabinets , so i want to at least have that finalized by the end of this week the plan for the kitchen is to paint the ceilings and the walls i'm going to paint the cabinets either a shade of white or possibly a light gray we bought butcherblock countertop and a white ceramic farmhouse sink i'm sooooo happy about both of those purchases i'm having brad remove one of the upper sections of cabinets from one side of the kitchen window so we can put open shelving there and we will be installing a white subway tile back splash the weather was perfect over the weekend we spent time outside we picked and ate many blueberries straight from the bushes we spent time weeding the raised beds we visited with family who were in from texas we played with our animals , and the kids visited and played with their cousins and spent lots of time in the pool we made sushi i listed a bunch of homeschool material online i spent some time knitting my shawl and spinning some merino it was very unusually laid back for a summer weekend
