emergency situations if your friend is threatening to hurt him or herself or someone else , do n't minimize your friend 's threats you need to get your friend immediate help by either calling or bringing your friend to a hospital emergency room suggestions for non emergency situations start by listening and finding out what your friend needs if your friend confides in you that s he has been anxious or depressed and s he 's not suicidal or homicidal , you need to start by listening in some cases , your friend might just want emotional support s he might just need you to listen you can let

by telling him or her if you can relate to the problem if you 've never experienced this type of problem , be as empathetic as possible to show your friend that you care ask questions about what your friend has already done to resolve the problem if your friend is open to therapy then there 's no problem you 're not going to risk alienating him or her with a recommendation that s he attend psychotherapy the trickier situation is when a friend has misconceptions about psychotherapy and would be insulted if you suggested it in a situation where you think your friend would be offended by a suggestion to go to therapy , you could start by asking your friend what s he has already tried to resolve the problem very often , people with longstanding problems have tried many different things before they consider psychotherapy someone who has tried many different ways to resolve a problem might be more open to considering psychotherapy talk about your experiences in therapy after you listen to your friend describe his or her efforts to resolve the problem , you could talk about your experiences and how it helped you , if you feel comfortable doing this knowing that a close friend

time the first step would be going to a consultation with a psychotherapist , which does not obligate your friend to continue the consultation would be an appointment with a therapist to talk about the problem in a broad way , ask questions , and to see if s he feels comfortable with the therapist your friend can also have consultations with a few psychotherapists before choosing one see my
