i'm a little worried you see , my excellent run this weekend may have been due in part to a decrease in one of my medications it is a med i take for fatigue today , i had another sleep filled , heavy , dragging day i did run my scheduled ten miler , but otherwise i slept almost as many hours as i was awake i'm barely hanging on now despite all that sleep so , i'm a little worried running faster may equal being more fatigued i really , really hope not , but i'm a little worried more on this tomorrow i gotta get to bed !
