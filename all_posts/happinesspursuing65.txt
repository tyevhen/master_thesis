when i went off the good st john last autumn i explained that it might have made me too happy and i could n't have that sounds perfectly silly when i say it like that anyway , i spent months letting that nugget of truth or whatever it is a nugget of seep into my brain and lodge itself there now that i 've taken the brave step of trying to work through happiness i find that the stuff seems to work really well an hour or so after taking it and about the time that i completely forget that i 've done so a sense of pleasentness comes over me it lasts for a few hours and i do n't crash afterwards if i remember to take a pill at every meal and that 's turning out to be a pretty good challenge in itself then i seem to maintain a generally happy disposition now when i feel myself slipping down i can think back and almost invariably realize that i forgot my wort with my last meal placebo effect ? maybe but i 'll take it ! if it is a pe will this entry mark the end of its effectiveness ?
