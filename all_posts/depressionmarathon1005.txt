tonight was the big night i spoke at my aa home group tonight i was so nervous it was rather ridiculous i spent more hours than i care to admit typing up my life 's path this afternoon , but i'm glad i did being prepared helped tonight i think it went well i was anxious about talking about depression in conjunction with my aa talk , but i did it anyway and received a lot of very positive feedback for doing so i also gave a shout out to my mental health treatment team psychiatrists and psychologists are often derided by hardcore aa'ers who think aa should cure everything that ails us again , i received a lot of positive feedback from others who admitted to using outside help so it was a success , and i'm relieved it was n't as difficult as i thought it would be , and the positive feedback felt really good like i said , i'm relieved i'm so grateful to have found a community of wonderful , sober , healthy and fun people i never would have thought any of this possible just a few short years ago if you 're struggling with alcohol , i encourage you to seek help if i can do it , anybody can
