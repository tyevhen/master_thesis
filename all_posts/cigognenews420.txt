there is a story today about the film mission impossible with tom cruz which has been shoved aside in sales by the new film , the horror film the devil inside so why is that ? wait a minute the film is about exorcism and that is about getting rid of your inner demons through shake , rock and roll and a little screaming in my patois it is called abreaction so what does the film do ? it installs terror in you and then tells you how to get rid of it exorcism this is no different from what is happening world wide to those who try to follow my therapy through getting patients to smack the wall , scream and get angry all that is missing from their therapy and the film is context , the origin of the terror in the film they give you a context , a symbolic one that stands for the deep terror inside so many of us it riles up the fear and then shows the ways to release it and that is one major reason it is so popular you can be terrorized safely in a warm environment and live through someone else s catharsis what a great formula you can walk out of the theater relieved and calmer and the price was very paltry the difference in primal therapy is context , connecting with the generating source , the imprinted memory of that terror therein lies true liberation so the film goes through the motions of getting rid of the pain without really doing it and that is what so many clinics do in the name of primal you don t even have to hurt , and that is so attractive but such a chimera why context ? because the origin of the terror , the imprinted memory , lies there and only there any other attempt to shake off the terror will fail
