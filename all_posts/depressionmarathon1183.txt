i realized today i 've been depriving all of you the opportunity to travel inexpensively and donate to a good cause at the same time ! i have an online travel business with a search engine capable of searching over other travel sites ! in just one search , you can get all of the prices offered by almost every other travel site available we search all of the big ones , travelocity , orbitz , cheap tickets , etc , as well as hundreds you 've never heard of so save your time and search once , rather than bouncing around looking for the lowest price , and be assured you are going to get every price offered across the web at that moment in time but that 's not all ! ! insert dorky pitch man here ! besides supporting my business , saving time , and saving money , i donate a percentage of my earnings to the national alliance on mental illness you get to support mental health research , education , and awareness while you travel how cool is that ? please check out my site here in the future , just look for the link in the sidebar thanks for your support !
