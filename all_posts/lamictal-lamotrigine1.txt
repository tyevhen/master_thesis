the little sheet they gave me with my abilify scrip warns against direct sunlight lamictal , as we know , can really screw with your skin combine those with an outdoor baseball game and you have well screwed up skin i attended a baseball game three weeks ago in spite of the spf sunblock i put on my arms , they 're still peeling after three weeks as for my shins , where i forgot to apply sunblock entirely , let 's just say that they were pretty screwed up at first they followed the usual sunburn pattern they turned red and sensitive they started peeling then , surprise ! petechiea those are those little red spots on the skin which i experienced on day after exercising they went away after a few days , and i am once again peeling like a mofo i burn pretty easily , but i 've never had a burn like this that just keeps peeling needless to say i broke out the aloe but i would have been happier if i 'd applied more sunblock
