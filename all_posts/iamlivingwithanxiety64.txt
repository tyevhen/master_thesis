one of my favorite recovery phrases is feelings are not facts dr low has an entire chapter on this topic , writing i want you to know that your feelings are not facts they merely pretend to reveal facts your feelings deceive you they tell you of danger when there is no hazard , of wakefulness when sleep was adequate , of exhaustion when the body is merely weary and the mind discouraged in speaking of your symptoms , your feelings lie to you if you trust them , you are certain to be betrayed into panics and vicious cycles this is a powerful message for people struggling with anxiety when we feel life is out of control , that imminent danger is around the corner , that we are having a heart attack it s easy maybe natural ? to believe these feelings but dr low advises us to spot these unrealistic notions , replace them with secure thoughts , and take the total view of the situation i find this recovery tool so helpful because it s short , easy to remember , and applies to most anxiety provoking situations , in which there usually is no factual danger i think it can be especially helpful for people struggling with ocd while there may be a strong urge to believe something is unsanitary , that a ritual is required to perform a mundane task , and so on , these feelings do not line up with reality the next time you spot yourself working yourself up , try reminding yourself that feelings are not facts of course , recovery teaches us that you won t experience instant relief , but over time the reality of the situation will become clearer than how the stranger in the brain perceives it to be i endorsed for writing this post reference low aa mental health through will training glencoe , ill willett publishing co
