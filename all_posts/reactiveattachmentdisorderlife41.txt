apparently our son with rad is not going to get hired at burger king he applied a while back and made it through the first interview he came out using his charming and endearing characteristics except that he was doing them at a much younger level i assume that means he did it during his interview as well which would have made him appear very immature well , he is , but it would have made it worse i took him to the psychiatrist last week and she gave me a brilliant suggestion she suggests we go to a nursing home and have him apply to work in the kitchen or clean she said kids like him generally do well in this environment because they receive a lot of praise and attention from the residents so today that is where he is going to apply i can see he would love that if he can just get on there i recently finished reading letters to a young therapist excellent book in this book the seasoned therapist has written letters to a graduate student over a year and then published them she said she gives her depressed clients things they need to try to do each day the first is to exercise exercise causes our bodies to raise its endorphin level which provides a feeling of well being think of the runner 's high the second is to do something nice for someone each day it is better to give then to receive and the third is to spend some time outside each day she felt that breathing fresh air and enjoying god 's creation is important to happiness we can assist our kids in all of these activities sure it is not going to turn someone who is depressed into a bouncing happy child but it will improve their mood therefore improving their life we are working on this ! have a healing day !
