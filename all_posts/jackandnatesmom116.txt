this morning i was sitting upstairs while john was getting dressed for work and we had the news on all of the sudden we hear the newscaster say something about a report that could potentially erase autism we looked at each other like huh ? i proceeded to stay glued to the screen for as long as possible and never heard a word on the today show about it so i decided to google it big mistake have you tried googling the following lately ? autism , causes autism , news , autism , pregnancy first of all , it s depressing second of all , wow the number of theories out there is staggering the thing that is most obvious is that really no one knows thank goodness the idea of it being mom s fault for being a refrigerator mom aka , unaffectionate , inattentive , etc has been thrown out the window however , here is what is disturbing me the number of results i found when i googled autism , pregnancy brain changes that relate to autism begin in the womb http www usatoday com story news nation autism labor induction eating healthy fats during pregnancy may reduce the risk of autism http news yahoo com eating healthy fats during pregnancy may reduce babys html antibodies during pregnancy linked to autism http www futurity org health medicine antibodies during pregnancy linked to autism induced labor linked to raised risk of autism http www webmd com baby news induced labor linked to raised risk of autism study suggests mom s health during pregnancy correlated to autism risk http www webmd com brain autism news moms health while pregnant linked autism risk flu fever in pregnancy linked with autism risk http www nbcnews com health flu fever linked autism pregnancy study c major stress during pregnancy linked to autism http mentalhealth about com library sci blpregnant htm lack of folic acid in pregnancy linked with autism http www npr org blogs health folic acid for pregnant mothers cuts kids autism risk study links autism with antidepressant use during pregnancy http parenting blogs nytimes com study links autism with antidepressant use during pregnancy ?

and as you can see , all we have to do is consult google to find out that we did everything wrong , right well let s review my personal history both times i was pregnant , i was not obese , i did not have diabetes or hypertension , i took folic acid , my thyroid results were fine , i did not take valproate , i did not have extra ultrasounds , my kids were almost years apart , i didn t have the flu or a fever , although i did have a stomach bug neither of my labors were induced , in fact , no pitocin actually entered my body during either delivery , nor did i even have an epidural with my second labor i did take an antidepressant , but i switched to the one that is considered safe in pregnancy that doesn t change the fact that i still feel guilty about it maybe that s it maybe i caused this this still enters my mind , even though there are significant genetic correlations in both my family and john s , which we were not even aware of when our boys were born i can still find a way to blame myself if i could reason with journalists and medical agencies who are releasing this information , i would say that by making these likely insignificant correlations public , they are making many mothers feel like bad parents mothers who actually need and deserve the exact opposite i understand that everyone is searching for answers i understand that everyone wants to be the one who figures this out but ouch , is this hurtful here is the most credible resource i have found http imperfectmommy com blog having a child increases your chances of having a child with autism absolutely love this i never did figure out what the autism eraser is guess i ll have to stay tuned maybe i should have avoided drinking water ?
