the deprivathon i nothing fills the body like tobacco gas sating each bronchiole until alveoli collapse , punctured bubble wrap , yet it is not the health risk i address but slavery , the false comfort of stuffing the god shaped vacuum with dark matter inscrutable face of the known universe know that without tobacco my chest is an abandoned altar , my lungs empty gloves this day by the grace of the unknowable i will not smoke ii how can i wax oracular about a deadly habit ? shall i say , i saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by white voodoo missiles from the military industrial suicidal tobacco coven , red man 's revenge funded by oil wealthy oklahoma indians , saw the blue smoke climb the undefended caves of their nostrils like mutated kudzu planting a manitou deep in their unsuspecting ribs to one day metastasize and waste their brains for the prize of a green oxygen tank and a wheelchair ! o cancer ! o emphysema ! o stroke ! o coronary ! o insidious degenerative enzymes from secret hybrid leaves developed for mass destruction ! o refreshing salems in a waterfall among the green ferns ! o perfect models with khaki slacks and sweaters tied around their necks sailing off martha 's vineyard , liberated by newports ! o marlboro man who never talks but rides by purple mountains and orange sunsets in his fleece lined suede jacket ! o virginia slims who keep that weight off for a woman who is only a clothes rack for designers , x ray clavicles and botox o be happy , go lucky , winston tastes good , the pause that refreshes , smooth , smooth , smooth as polished agate but i'm not starving hysterical naked only addicted to inhaled nicotine jolting the brain in seven seconds , instantaneous pleasure loop hydrogen jukebox ! iii mornings are made worse by smoking too much under the influence of alcohol the night before , which temporarily dulled the pain of inhalation you wake up feeling like a crematorium , still , have to have that morning rush while listening to the coffeemaker hum with the refrigerator i can t ignore the pleading quality of machines a whir , a whine , as if a wish for petting , as if they sympathized somehow , could understand the loss of choice it s said one of three will die from smoking but this is only pseudoscientific propaganda easier to see the damage in finely furrowed faces , gray with sunken cheeks who purse their lips to make it easier to exhale against the increased resistance the blue bloaters of emphysema then there are the barrel chested wheezers who hyperventilate to compensate the pink puffers of chronic bronchitis yet none of this so terrifies as does the black crab lung cancer patients stink no one wants to play with them on the field or at the rink , no one wants to stay with them because cancer is possession by an alien cells gone native , cells too stupid to know they destroy their host , mole burrowed deep , tiny claws scratch at the pulmonary tree in the darkness of blood and bronchi iv depression and loss look much the same along life 's hedgerow , still , differ as hawthorn from holly , as grape from pear loss is a coin tossed down a well until you hear the plunk of water and weep in depression you never hear the coin drop nicotine , like benzedrine , has antidepressant properties deprived , the mind shudders like an old engine who will pull this train ? i think i can , i think i can , desiring this man 's art and that man 's scope the sea has jaws and a gray green coat what hangs from the jaws is pulverized to pebbles until the shingle rattles before an otter floating in the caramel kelp the disconnection , stoppage , hesitation , grappling for numbers , addresses , details , sans nicotine i mourn the vanished power of the stimulated reign v my parents smoked , it was not unpleasant it was present at christmas with the holly wreath and the brown couch with the little nubs and the wrought iron legs from which my mother read hiawatha to us while smoking mom smoked when i was a fetus bad , bad mother mom withheld her nipples from me mean , mean mother she tried to nurse my older brother but failed weak , weak mother at birth i knew what she knew there must be a substitute vi i saw the spirit of fire , tobaccohontas in her coronet of coals dancing in a leaf skirt of golden brown , her incendiary thighs burning burning burning before her only god breathed fire afterwards came dragons , venomous snakes and toads finally man 's penis swelled and woman 's labia grew bloody purple , pink and wet i heard tobaccohontas speak i burn for you , brave do not forget your love cleave me with your tomahawk , undo the seam so lightly stitched by nature or my own nails will ream it , drive your spear into the ravenous slit beneath the golden curls of my mons , pound me as a bear ruts a sow in a ditch littered with salmon bones and acorns my mouths have swallowed the seed of many warriors , come ah , tobaccohontas , i once fingered your moist fragrance in blue pouches of drum tobacco your scent still calls me from the tent of the elders puff by puff but moderation is beyond me i must devour and be devoured hear me my lava grows hard in your ocean your undersea cleft shapes me my tip breaks off like a coal in your wet purse i shudder , deflate and die you are the siren of my death i stub you out in ashtrays as if they were vampires coffins through which to pound my stake now i can only suck the memory of your forbidden pleasure and cast its usage toward some future beyond obsession forgive me princess you were the best vii withdrawal still twists me on its spit i suck my toothbrush in a rage , spit out toothpicks like a nail gun when then is there an end to it ? was slavery worth the wage ? no i must can t think of it ! i ll wash my inside windows today after the windex and the suds the accumulated slime runs yellow and gray onto my rag , phlegm of oncology the same sick mucous color you get from washing an ashtray i was living in an ashtray no i was a living ashtray yet when the windows were done i was at a loss at how to reward myself a glass of water ? a walk in the park ? a swim at the gym ? a pitcher of warm spit ? nothing beats a cigarette i must hold on hold out hold to hold forth hold back hold sway mommy , don t let me die an ashtray viii there is an absence greater than absence of life there is a hollow hollower than death when the lights go off in the gunman 's eyes and every man becomes a purse there is a loss greater than loss of pleasure when there is no breast or nipple and the nurse removes your pacifier and the wailing of your deprivation goes unnoticed in the bassinet and your infant body shakes into the grief of sleep or when standing at the railing of your crib and there is no mother and no substitute for mother in the endless darkness why can t you change yourself ? after such abandonment you may spend your life seeking a fix like the milk dewed nipple in the rhythm of the bliss of your sucking , the warm pillow of breast pressed against your face ix there is so little poetry left i suffer its loss as much as cigarettes it may leave a bigger emptiness love or addiction ? sometimes i think addiction especially when i am around poets and feel the heat of their narcissism rise like steam from a meatloaf , the endless infantile hunger to be heard the problem is that poets can t give themselves a fix , they need an audience for praise plato was right and wrong he never imagined the democratization of poetry , fearing aeschylus and aristophanes not angelou and bukowski you say i am writing prose now i say form must fit function in this proliferation of venues and dilution of talent on the internet and in overpriced coffeehouses what do i really think ? forget poetry , poetry sucks poetry sucks donkey dicks in the dead of night poetry sucks the butt holes of rabid bats poetry sucks the big walla walla like a staubsauger poetry is a concentration camp for narcissists poetry is eternal competition with every poet , living or dead poetry causes stillborns , curdles milk and stains the altar with pig s blood poetry is bread in the mouth of a pigeon spreading legionnaire 's disease poetry is the word flu fuck poetry x when asked why she did n't quit , bette davis replied , then how would i talk ? gesturing with her cigarette holder and what if i become seriously depressed when the faces of familiar cars look strange and i am frightened by doorknobs and tea kettles , when whatever spark of self i knew flies up and out the chimney into the wailing dark ? will i zero sum suck again ? that is always one danger when smoking or not smoking appear equally pointless in a universe without pity ergo , who cares if i smoke ? in that state , which always returns i vow to pretend to care against all evidence the other danger is similar on a very good day , say your daughter s wedding or grandson 's baptism , when the joyful conviction of invulnerability whispers , you ve achieved control and can have just one i have decided when i get the urge to imagine a silver angel with glacier blue eyes and crystal hair swooping down like winged victory to pluck my desire in her gleaming hands and throw it back to heaven as a spent coal
