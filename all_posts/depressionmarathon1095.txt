anger , fear , disappointment , resentment , frustration negative emotions such as these seem to be doubly difficult for me to handle as a result of this illness i'm not talking about jumping off a bridge or anything , but i 've noticed recently that any negative emotion can trigger a steep , precipitous slide into the abyss darkness and despair seem to be ever present just beneath my surface it makes feeling angry , fearful , frustrated or disappointed quite dangerous for me i wonder if anybody else has this experience ? am i unique in this ? have you noticed ? i 'd love to know
