i finally received my boot today my right achilles tendon is now officially immobilized it will remain so for the next weeks my right ankle is immobilized in approximately degrees of plantarflexion toes pointed downward , like in a high heel shoe it 's very uncomfortable to walk , so i believe i will use crutches for anything longer than household distances i'm not sure how work is going to go because it 's like i have one leg inches longer than the other , which makes balance an issue i need to be balanced when working with unsteady patients i may need to ask for help , and i hate asking for help why is asking for help so difficult for some of us ? i'm going to get plenty of practice at asking over the next weeks for example , i ca n't mow my lawn safely in this boot , so i will need to ask someone at least weekly to push my lawnmower for me thankfully , my friend , pam , offered this week , and i took her up on that offer tonight but i dread the thought of asking her , or anyone else , over and over again it 's the same issue at work we 're all busy i do n't want to bother my co workers or ask them to do part of my job even though my bosses said it would be okay to get help , i feel hesitant to ask for it i feel like i need to pull my own weight , and if i ca n't , i should n't work unfortunately , i ca n't afford not to work i need to keep working as much as i can i guess that means i 'll be asking for help there , too ugh ! the challenges of wearing this boot will be many , i'm afraid at least i'm less frustrated now that i'm in the boot , and i 've begun the healing process i'm anxious about the outcome , but i'm going to try to put that worry on the back burner there 's nothing i can do today about what will happen six weeks from now there 's no use fretting about it i 'll be traveling to duluth this weekend for grandma 's marathon , this time as a spectator it will be different standing on the sidelines of my favorite race , but i know several runners who will be participating , so i 'll have plenty of cheer to give out i'm also looking forward to being able to stay out late with friends that will be really different that 's the silver lining , i guess let the healing , and the fun , begin !
