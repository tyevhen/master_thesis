thank you ! ! ! i want to take this moment to thank all of you who have ever commented on this blog if you do not write a blog , you may not realize how nice it is to get a comment ! lately , i 've been struggling with motivation i 've been questioning my purpose it 's classic depression crap , but that does n't make it less bothersome or real your comments help me cope with the crap submitting a comment lets me know i 've touched someone outside my miserable self when you comment , i learn a bit about you , and what you need , want , or appreciate comments let me know that i 've connected with you , and for that instant my writing fulfilled the intended purpose maybe something i wrote made a small difference in your day that 's always rewarding to hear maybe a post helped you think about something in a little different way positive or negatively and that , too , is satisfying maybe something you read helped begin a discussion with others in the real world that 's very cool depression is such a silent illness , maybe reading my blog is the only time you talk about it i always hope i 've caught at least one person like that i want to offer support and relief i want readers to know , you are not alone and when you submit a comment , you also tell me i am not alone your comments help me because my depression is isolating it is often a silent , solitary illness for me , too your comments keep me going when i want to stop they keep me connected when i think i want to be alone they instigate a smile , a laugh , or a bright moment in my day i appreciate your opinions , your feedback , and your experience your comments support me , and i appreciate them more than i can express so , thank you ! thank you for taking a moment to read my pondering thank you for expressing your point of view thank you for sharing your experience , strength and hope with me and all the other readers here thank you thank you
