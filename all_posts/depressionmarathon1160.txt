ever have one of those days where the past smacks you in the face over and over again ? i created one of those days today i 've been missing some important items for a few years , and i set out to find them today why have i been missing things ? as i 've remarked here previously , i had ect treatments for my treatment resistant depression as a result , i lost my memory totally and therefore lost a few years of my life i moved into this house right in the middle of that lost time period today , i was looking for my marathon and track medals for important reasons i wo n't get into here i have beautiful medals gold and a bronze from a international track meet in sydney , australia had no idea where they were , but i figured they were probably with my marathon medals , which were also missing i was also searching for my wedding ring it 's true , i am no longer married , but that ring represents a beautiful time in my life besides , we designed them and had a jeweler hand craft them for our wedding it had been so long since i had seen it , i was really afraid i might have accidentally thrown it away in the end , i found all of the above , but i had to do a lot of digging to get there the digging became the problem in the process of searching through my bedroom , i emptied some drawers containing lots of old writing and recovery stuff there were folders full of crap from outpatient treatment , dialectical behavior therapy , cognitive behavioral therapy , step work , and multiple hospitalizations the journal containing one of my suicide notes was under some books i unearthed pictures of friends who used to be close but are now distant ouch , family photos from relatives i no longer hear from , and even a picture of an old college flame ancient watches , jewelry , cards , and notes everything meant something everything reminded me , usually painfully so , of a different time in my life it was amazing even old , broken watches instantly transported me back to the days each watch dressed my wrist it was an exhausting trip down memory lane divergent , wide ranging feelings crowded my soul as if competing for supremacy , those multiple mixed up feelings threatened to overwhelm me throughout the day sadness , hurt , disappointment , anger , loss , grief , gratitude , and cheer each took center stage at one point or another deciding what to keep and what to throw also caused internal conflict by the time i found what i was looking for i felt battered and bruised from the inside out yet , i also felt relieved cleaning out some of the trash from the past , whether it was a sock , a key , a card , a piece of writing , or an entire program 's folder , felt healing although reading some of my previous troubled writing was difficult , it also healed me i felt grateful to no longer be in such a painful space i was grateful for the difference between then and now it reaffirmed the work i 'd done and reinforced that i had improved some of the writing even filled in pieces of my lost years , which apparently were quite painful and filled with drink it was quite clear , i did n't want to live in some ways , i'm amazed to be sitting here today feeling so different though not gone , my depression is different suicide , once a daily contemplation , now enters only occasionally , and it rarely feels like an option today , my writing reveals more control , less desperation and hopelessness i am less a victim of a cruel , cruel world today i am more willing to take responsibility for my care back then , i was certain i was doomed there was no light ever coming my way today , i'm more accepting of the lows i have more faith they will pass and while i still do n't wish depression on anyone , while depression still stops me in my tracks , i feel less helpless and more willing to do what i can within its temporary limits after my difficult trip through the past , it was nice to see i 'd improved today , because of the work i 've done and the help i 've received , my life is better and easier i am more functional i am more accepting of myself and others i 've learned to take responsibility for my actions i'm more tolerant , and i am significantly more spiritual i'm not perfect , but now i'm okay with that and i have gratitude today i never had that in the past being able to function today was an example of these changes i continued functioning despite a myriad of painful feelings and memories without hurting myself , lashing out at someone else , self medicating or sleeping that is not only an improvement , it 's a miracle thank you d e , k l , a a , kim , cindy and bill , mom and bruce , running , and puck thank you i am so grateful to all of you
