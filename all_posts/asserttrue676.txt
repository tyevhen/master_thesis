today , i was reading failure trends in a large disk drive population pdf , a february paper by eduardo pinheiro , wolf dietrich weber , and luiz andr barroso of google , containing lots of great data on hard drive failures and the difficulty of predicting same the above graph depicts one of the more interesting findings , which is that the effect of operating temperature on disk reliability appears to vary with disk age , such that younger drives tend to be more susceptible to low temperature failures , whereas older drives tend to be more susceptible to failure at elevated temperatures results are grouped by age of disk at failure , then broken out into subgroups histogram bars based on their operating temperature so for example , among disks that failed at years of age , the annualized failure rate afr was about for those disks that had had operating temps of deg c or more , versus a fail rate of for those that had seen temps of less than deg c many people have assumed that high temps are bad for disks and indeed maybe they are bad for year old disks , but disks that fail at younger ages tend to be much more traumatized by cold than by heat pinheiro et al give additional data for this , and it 's pretty convincing for example , if you have a look at fig of the paper , you 'll see a bathtub curve , showing that extremes of temperature are deleterious to disk life expectancy ironically , the bathtub curve reaches its lowest point at around deg c very close to human body temperature
