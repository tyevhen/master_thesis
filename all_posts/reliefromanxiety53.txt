this post is following on from my previous one giving an introduction to self harm , which you can read , here this time round , i'm going to share with you some advice of perhaps other coping techniques , or how to deal with self harm itself talk talking is always key if you have someone to whom you can share how you 're feeling with , i believe the chances of self harming reduces because the intensity that you 're feeling should lessen you also know that you have that support around you find your own techniques self harm for me tends to be something i do when i ca n't find any other way to release the tension and to not take part in it , can require a lot of will power but to try and avoid it , i try to do things such as going outside , doing kick boxing , mindfulness , talking and so forth i give myself the image of myself of how i would feel afterwards i try to find other ways to deal with my pain thinking if you have the urge to self harm , try to give yourself some breathing time to consider whether you really want to go down that route or not i have found that giving myself this time has often meant that i did n't harm myself in the end care if you do find yourself self harming , do n't feel ashamed i understand that the normal feelings are guilt and anger , as i too have felt it myself but , it does n't mean that you have taken a few steps back , it just means you needed to do something to get rid of the pain you were feeling of course , embarking on less harmful ways of reliving pain is something to work on make sure that you look after any wounds , and give yourself some time to heal afterwards you can find mind 's self harm advice , here i hope this has helped in some way if you have any other advice , please leave a comment below best wishes , amy xx
