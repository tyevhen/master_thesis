today has been frustrating i bought a utility cabinet to assemble , only to discover it was missing a piece ok , i thought , no need to become upset over this i 'll do something else so i decided to complete my taxes after gathering my paperwork , i realized i was missing one of my documents i tried to go online to access it , only to find the internet was down argh when we 're stressed , we grow tense , and when we become tense , we often become anxious the muscles across my chest were tight my mind was racing and i was not in the best of moods before my recovery training , i would n't have recognized that i was in jeopardy of my emotions getting out of control i would have brewed , boiled , and found myself anxious everything would have irritated me obsessions would return it would not be a good day instead , i 've spotted what 's going on this situation is frustrating but not dangerous frustrations like this occur throughout everyone 's day i can take rational steps to deal with these frustrations i 'll call the store and ask if i have to return the entire cabinet or if i can just pick up the missing piece i 'll gather what paperwork i have for my taxes , and wait for the rest to arrive by mail i 'll find something else to do while the internet is down , such as writing this blog i'm disappointed my day did n't work out as planned , but that 's no reason to let anxiety and anger rule my day
