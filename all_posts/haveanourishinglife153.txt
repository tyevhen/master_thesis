painting of the day tea cup by mary borchers a lovely blogger , therese borchard , i know , similar last names ! crazy , huh ? ! often says that you should write from where you are and not from where you want to be today , i am guilty as charged i had this really great article written up with quotes and links and all that good blogging stuff but when it came down to posting it , therese 's advice popped into my head i am sometimes not always guilty of writing from this beautifully hopeful place that sounds so great to me and that is not necessarily a bad thing but the reality is , i still have a long way to go until i get there i will publish my other brilliant post some other time when it feels more honest but for now like a birthday balloon that miraculously survived a rowdy four year old 's party but was left alone for weeks , i woke up this morning with a deflated self esteem i do n't know where the heck that analogy came from but , in my mind , it makes sense for some reason , unknown to me , i feel like everything good has fled my consciousness i am left with only negative thoughts constant , tormenting , negative thoughts i'm fat i'm a failure i'm not good at anything my life is such a waste and repeat , like a broken record it is good for me to read my own advice as well as to write it down for others i try to practice everything i preach , but sometimes i fail and that is ok like today , all i want to do is either scream in frustration or stay in bed all day long and not face anything that comes my way but i know that wo n't make me feel better this time i 'll just be disappointed in myself if i do n't do anything i 'll end up feeling worse than when i started so , i am going to try to push myself to get through this difficult time i will start by leading with my body and maybe my head will catch up i wrote a piece on this advice a while back click here if you missed it the basic idea is that , if your brain wants you to do something that is not so good for you , going through the motions of a good routine can help your head get to a better place sometimes , on the other hand , the hurdles are not that important so if it is causing too much anxiety , i might pass on that battle not the whole war just that battle this obstacle , however , is important to me so it is worth pushing myself
