i talked a few weeks ago about how overwhelmed i get with all of the different appointments , supplements , therapies , etc another area that can get very overwhelming is the whole dietary aspect jack is gluten and dairy for the most part free we allow him to have some real cheese , as when i saw his igg levels that qualified him as sensitive , they were extremely low also , if you have ever seen the gluten and dairy free cheese substitutes you will understand why i feel like a cruel mama feeding them to my kid we continue with dairy free yogurt , ice cream , and avoid any other dairy when at all possible nate was on the specific carbohydrate diet from december until , well , now i have not taken him off of it officially , and we still comply with it most of the time , but i have been allowing some cheats this was kind of inspired by the fact that he really had n't made much progress while on the diet there are maybe foods that do n't follow the diet that i am allowing him to have in small amounts his envirokidz cereal , gluten free fries , veggie booty , and gluten dairy free fish sticks call me crazy , but i was having a really really hard time denying him one of the few things that i can tell he truly enjoys food also , because these foods are new and exciting to him , they are extremely motivating speech wise he says pop for the cereal , and today he said fry f is a totally new sound for him he is also trying to say cookie today he also said open at ot and back to daddy he also said thank you to daddy the other day his ot said that his session today was probably the best one he had ever had so i would say he 's doing ok with the new foods so anyway , when i was thinking of what would make life feel a little less overwhelming groceries and meals immediately came to mind when we first implemented these diets for the boys , cost was really no object we were more focused on getting the right foods , preparing them appropriately and monitoring any changes but as we all know , these foods are extremely expensive and the grocery bills have gotten out of hand i have now been monitoring this much more closely and trying to find relevant coupons which is kind of like trying to find a needle in a haystack i have limited my whole foods trips to every other week , and i buy only the speciality items the boys need during these trips everything else comes from our local grocery store it means running to more than one store some weeks , but it 's worth it the other thing i have done is dust off the slow cooker and make the commitment to find recipes that we can all eat sounds like a pretty tall order right ? it really has n't been that tough several of you have asked for recipes i talked about on facebook , so i thought i would post them here and tell how i modified them , if i had to , to make them suitable for the boys it 's been way easier than i thought it would be ! balsamic pear , chicken and asparagus http allrecipes com recipe balsamic pear chicken and asparagus detail aspx ?
