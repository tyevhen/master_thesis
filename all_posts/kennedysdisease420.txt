i recently received the following question this week do you know of any understandable explanation of cag count and its importance and implications to sbma sufferers ? everything i have found is pretty unintelligible to me and i thought i was a pretty intelligent kind of a person ! ! from what i can gather the count length whatever that is i have no idea of mine is important to diagnosing the condition but is of no particular relevance in assessing the outcome is that correct ? so i consulted our biology professor and asked for help ed provided the following explanation of the dna mutation and kennedy s disease i definitely learned something from his explanation thanks , ed kennedy s disease aka sbma is a genetic disease aside from the fact that this means one inherits the disease from one 's parents , this fact has other implications the fact that it is genetic also means that there is a change in a gene a gene being an inheritable factor that influences some trait genes are made of a type of biomolecule called dna dna , in turn , is composed of long chains of small subunit molecules called nucleotides different genes are linked together to form larger dna structures called chromosomes humans have pairs of chromosomes for a total number of and each chromosome can have over a thousand different genes nonetheless , each chromosome in every person should contain the same genes in the same order now since genes are made up of dna , and genes make up chromosomes , chromosomes contain dna so essentially , the genetic material has a hierarchical structure chromosomes genes nucleotides a simple , similar analogy might be building walls bricks now one might wonder what makes each gene different as was stated , each gene is made of dna which is in turn made of nucleotides dna employs different nucleotides adenine , guanine , cytosine and thymine scientists , being efficient or maybe lazy abbreviate these with single letters a , g , c and t each gene has a specific , unique sequence of nucleotides much like words have a specific , unique sequence of letters the primary difference is that each gene 's sequence is very long , often in excess of a thousand nucleotides the sequence of nucleotides in a gene tells the cell how to make a specific protein , thus each gene codes for the production of a specific protein if the nucleotide sequence of a gene is altered this alteration is known as a mutation , the resulting protein is altered and it may not work normally and often does not work at all the result of such a change may results in changes in the way the cells work and if this occurs , we would say that this would be a genetic disease thus kennedy s disease is due to a mutation in a specific gene that alters the function and structure of a specific protein the gene mutated in kennedy s disease is the gene that codes for the protein known as the androgen receptor ar the type of change in the nucleotide sequence in the gene for ar that causes kd is quite unusual usually , mutations are due to nucleotide substitutions or deletions or insertions but this is not true for kennedy s disease kennedy s disease is due to the repeat of a three nucleotide sequence a repeat of the sequence that is cytosine adenine guanine or cag in the scientific shorthand this cag pronounces see a gee , not pronounced so it rhymes with hag repeat actually occurs in the ar gene in all humans where its repeat number is quite variable the repeat only causes kennedy s disease when the repeat number exceeds cag repeated times individuals with repeat numbers less than do not have kennedy s disease at this time , it is not clear why this causes kennedy s disease scientists are trying to find out but it does !
