i was contemplating being alone on christmas eve while jet and i were out on a lovely , warm , mile late afternoon run earlier there was a ton of traffic between the early service christmas eve church goers and the last minute shoppers , the roads were bustling but jet and i had the paved bike trails , some of which parallel those busy roads , all to ourselves i found myself wondering what those drivers thought about a lone , female and her dog running on christmas eve i wondered if some of them , assuming correctly i was spending the day alone , felt sad for me that was , after all , the common reaction among my coworkers and patients earlier this week but i was n't sad then , and i'm not sad now i really enjoyed my solo run this afternoon unlike the travelers bustling around me , i did n't have any church commitment or last minute gifts to buy tonight i did n't have to be anywhere except right where i was on that uncluttered bike path with my dog i felt peaceful and serene this morning i volunteered to work some extra hours at the hospital , and i really enjoyed my patients and coworkers my patients seemed extra grateful for treatment received today , a holiday weekend , even though we always treat patients on holidays and my coworkers were quite appreciative they were extremely busy and way under staffed i felt glad to be able to help i left there feeling fulfilled i took a long nap after work and before my run , which was also lovely i just got out of a long , hot shower and now i'm sitting here , geeking out with my feet up , a football game muted on the television while i listen to a public radio christmas variety show and blog being alone is n't so bad i like the peacefulness i feel today i'm not sure what it 's all about i guess i'm just a loner at heart i'm sure if i was with family or friends , i 'd be enjoying that time , too , but this has been a good day it 's been a day of my choosing except for work this morning , i had nowhere to be , no expectations to meet , nobody to please i did what i did when i wanted to do it it 's been nice i have been invited to two christmas dinners tomorrow i appreciate the invites it will be nice to spend some time with friends i 'll go to one dinner , but other than those couple hours , i 'll spend tomorrow alone with jet , too and that 's okay i'm grateful to feel at peace this christmas i wish all of you peace , joy , and serenity , too merry christmas , my friends
