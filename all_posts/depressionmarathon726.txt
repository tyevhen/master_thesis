it 's so interesting being sober at a drinking party i went to a good old fashioned drinking party last night i do n't know what else to call it i mean jello shots were involved it was a little strange i have n't been to a party like that where much of the focus is on getting drunk for many , many years i know i have n't been to one since getting sober it was fun it was interesting the party was at the home of one of my co workers , and it was mostly co workers in attendance it was fun to see them outside of work i work with some very cool people we played stupid games , people got loud , and we laughed a lot i was the only one who was n't drinking , and i was perfectly okay with that i was just as silly and loud as many of the drunks that surprised me a bit i was expecting to feel more reserved without the loosening effect of the alcohol i was n't reserved , and i had fun so what 's my point ? well , i was pleasantly surprised at how okay i felt to me , it means i'm doing well it means i'm feeling spiritually fit at this moment , and my program of recovery is working in my life there have been times in my sobriety where i could n't have participated like i did last night the thoughts about joining in the fun would have been too great the cravings difficult to ignore but last night , i had fun i was a participant and that 's what recovery is about , participating in life , one day at a time
