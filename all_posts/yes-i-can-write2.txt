i talk a lot about learning in a general sense , but sometimes people want to know a bit more about my learning , my experience as an adult unschooler , and how that works how do i decide what to learn next ? how do i find the information that i need ? how do i learn ? i addressed the question somewhat in a recent patreon post , but as was pointed out by someone , if your background is one where learning is something divorced from your own interests and daily life , it might not be as obvious as my suggestion that learning is as simple as living life while curious i haven t been able to stop thinking about that , and so i figured maybe i could try to use some actual examples from my own life to illustrate the various ways i learn about the things i care about most while the more conventional understanding might be that a curriculum comes first and then it s followed in order for learning to happen , that s obviously not how i approach things so instead , i thought i d look back on the past year or so , and try to condense it into something like a portfolio this is what i ve been doing , and these have been some of the helpful resources i ve used makes sense ? okay , time to dive in ! media studies aka i watch a lot of tv shows and documentaries tv watching might have a bad rap documentaries not so much , but as i ve discussed in other posts , i actually interact with the shows i watch as do many people ! i watch them with others , and i look at the content critically not in an i only watch good shows way , because some of my faves are trash , but with an eye for what is well and badly done story wise , what biases or unspoken assumptions are at play , etc and on the flip side , i watch documentaries not only to learn about their topics , but for the beauty , the experimentation , and the art inherent in a good doc the how watch lots of things , read reviews and discussions online , watch video reviews and deconstructions , talk about tv and documentaries with others makeup this is an art and form of self expression that i cherish , and i ve been learning more about it , building skills , and amassing my own personal product hoard over the last couple of years i admired others for a while before i took the plunge myself , and it can admittedly be overwhelming there has been lots of googling , reading of reviews , instagram inspiration , and trial and error along the way but mainly ? there s been youtube ! the how youtube tutorials , product reviews , hauls , lots of experimentation and practice white supremacist hate groups and ideology with the belief in the old adage that it s important to understand your enemies , current events should provide a pretty clear picture of why i started digging deeper white supremacist hate groups have been around for a long time , but greater exposure in recent times has lead to a resurgence , and understanding what s behind it has seemed deeply relevant the how news articles , short form journalism , documentaries , long form journalism , conversations with others swimming starting in the winter , i made the huge stride for me of actually exercising regularly ! yay phys ed i guess ? ? it involves working through some anxiety not about the swimming itself , more about being alone with my own thoughts being difficult , building up stamina after not being physically active for a long time , and finding the meditative moments in leisurely treading water , the swirl between my fingers , and the sound of my own breathing as i float on my back the how buy pool membership , go to pool , swim cat behaviour anyone who knows me knows that i m pretty obsessed with cats it started when i was a toddler , and i really never grew out of it ! but instead of being content simply with cuddling and fussing over the three cats i share my home with , i wanted to understand more about their behaviour and motivations , the ways i can better communicate with and train them , what research is saying about feline cognition , and just generally how to be a better cat guardian and friend to cat kind the how reading and watching anything i can find by cat behaviorists , keeping up to date on new research , spending lots of time observing and interacting with cats literature appreciation aka i read a lot of novels since i first picked up a novel as i was learning to read , i never really stopped reading i am very much in love with the science fiction and fantasy genres , and i m usually in the middle of one novel or another over the past couple of years i ve even set myself yearly reading goals through the book social media site goodreads in i read books , and my goal for this year is i m a little behind right now , but still well on track to make it the how get a library membership and go there regularly , request they purchase new books in my preferred genre that are getting a lot of buzz , read books , read book reviews , write book reviews , talk about books with people self directed education the obvious one , really , so much so that it seems a bit superfluous to go into it more than this the how read articles and essays on unschooling self directed education and current events that influence both mainstream and alternative education , watch education documentaries , maintain a facebook page on the topic , write my own posts and essays on my blog and other places , talk about education this collection of interests is not an exhaustive one there have been plenty of other spurts of curiosity and research and dabbling but it is a good overview of the things i ve been most focused on in recent months the more you do things and learn things just because you re interested , you re curious , you care , the easier it becomes a habit formed of questions and google searches , a process of letting go of the need to prove the worthiness of a task in favor of just enjoying it self directed education might start out feeling complicated and it can certainly be difficult , as many things can be , even when we love them , but it doesn t have to be that way learning can be reclaimed , and enjoyed on its own merits , free from unnecessary complication and curriculum it can be simple
