things are looking up around here i'm moving ahead while i'm not quite back to full strength , i am feeling better every day i 've been able to run , work , do my chores , and meet with friends on a fairly consistent basis over the past days i'm grateful to be feeling more like myself again and i'm especially grateful this episode did not last very long if felt like forever when i was in the midst of it , but i know it could have been a lot , lot worse i'm not sure what else i have to report i'm glad i'm doing better , because work has been long and busy the last several days , including today i worked hours on friday , hours yesterday , and more today in between i ran miles on saturday i'm so glad i did n't have more than miles scheduled , as my legs were really dead it was a tougher than usual miles , and i was glad to be done i took a long snooze after that one i guess fatigue is the one lingering effect from this depression relapse that has n't really gotten better yet it was really noticeable during and after saturday 's run , but it 's been pretty significant every day i'm tired just tired i'm hoping the fatigue will abate soon in the meantime , i 'll keep sleeping a lot thank you all for your comments and support over the past couple weeks i so appreciate everyone who reads my little blog and your comments really did make a huge difference during this time
