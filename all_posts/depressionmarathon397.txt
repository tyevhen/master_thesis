i do n't want to write about not feeling good it 's been so long but for some reason , or no reason at all , yesterday was a rough day it was weird i awoke thursday morning feeling like i had been hit by a truck i could n't seem to shake the sleep from my body my mood was very low right off the bat i had an appointment early in the morning after returning home , it was my plan to go running i had a hill workout on my schedule but when i got home , all i could do was go back to bed my parents were visiting and just starting their day , but i could n't even stay awake for them they went about their business while i slept i figured i 'd be refreshed and ready to run when i awoke but two hours later , nothing had changed the extra sleep did n't help in fact , i laid back down shortly after i got up and it was n't only physical for the first time in a long time , my mood was in the tank i saw my doctor mid afternoon at our last visit , we discussed decreasing my anti depressant we were going to make a decision at yesterday 's appointment , but based upon how i was feeling , we decided against it of course that made sense , but i was so looking forward to lowering my dose things continued along the same lines most of the day i did get out with my mom for a couple hours late in the afternoon , but i never did get those hills run we ate dinner out , and i could n't wait to get home i went to bed long before they retired fortunately , my parents understand my occasional need for lots of sleep today has been slightly better i'm still lower than i 've been , but i'm not pushing the panic button yet i did okay at work today , even though i was n't my usual chatty , cheerful self i'm scheduled to run miles tomorrow , and with the cooperation of our current gorgeous , sunny , dry weather , i'm feeling fairly optimistic i 'll get it done i'm preparing now , and i plan for another early bed time tonight i'm feeling more hopeful this precipitous descent will reverse itself as quickly as it attacked and that 's what it felt like , a sneak attack it came out of the blue on what should have been a beautiful , happy day thankfully , that was yesterday , and i do n't have to live it again moving forward now , we 'll see what tomorrow brings
