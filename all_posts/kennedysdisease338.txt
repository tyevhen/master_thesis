yesterday ed meyertholen , kda board member and resident guru for explaining anything complicated , hosted the chat room the topic was an update on the gordon conference it wasn t long , however , before the topic shifted to biomarkers what they are and why they are important the key takeaway was that biomarkers can help determine if you have a disease before any symptoms show up for example , a biomarker could show that a person has cancer forming before any other physical signs are evident i e , a tumor , nagging cough , blood in stool , decline in red blood cells , etc i found the subject so interesting that i wanted to learn more so i went to wikipedia for answers wikipedia defines a biomarker as in medicine , a biomarker is a term often used to refer to a protein measured in blood whose concentration reflects the severity or presence of some disease state more generally a biomarker is anything that can be used as an indicator of a particular disease state or some other physiological state of an organism a biomarker is a parameter that can be used to measure the progress of disease or the effects of treatment the parameter can be chemical , physical or biological in molecular terms biomarker is the subset of markers that might be discovered using genomics , proteomics technologies or imaging technologies biomarker help in early diagnosis , disease prevention , drug target identification , drug response etc several diseased based biomarker had been identified for many diseases such as serum ldl for cholesterol , blood pressure , p gene and mmps for cancer etc uses for biomarkers for chronic diseases , whose treatment may require patients to take medications for years , accurate diagnosis is particularly important , especially when strong side effects are expected from the treatment in these cases , biomarkers are becoming more and more important , because they can confirm a difficult diagnosis or even make it possible in the first place a number of diseases , such as alzheimer s disease or rheumatoid arthritis , often begin with an early , symptom free phase in such symptom free patients there may be more or less probability of actually developing symptoms in these cases , biomarkers help to identify high risk individuals reliably and in a timely manner so that they can either be treated before onset of the disease or as soon as possible thereafter in kennedy s disease , our cag count is an indicator of a gene mutation , but not a biomarker by the time twitches , cramping , high creatinine levels , etc start showing up the progression has already began warning wednesday s snap quiz could contain questions on biomarkers , so be prepared
