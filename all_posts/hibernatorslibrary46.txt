neurotribes , by steve silberman , read by william hughes silberman explores the history of autism by weaving stories case histories of autistic people in with stories of psychological and ideological leaps in the understanding of autism he reveals a lot of details i did n't know about researchers like hans asperger and the making of the movie rainman it was information that i was intrigued by , though i found his writing style to be a bit winding at times in the end , i felt a little lost about what the thesis of silberman 's book was or if he had one at all before reading the book i expected to get a history of autism research with a lot of current information on the neurodiversity movement but because there were so many stories of autistic people woven into the book , i did n't really get what i expected the information seemed a bit scattered not that i did n't enjoy the book i did it was interesting reading about all those case histories it gave the book a personal air i just expected a more a to b to c historical account of the history of autism and the neurodiversity movement
