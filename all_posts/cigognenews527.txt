what is the common factor that makes it possible for one approach to fit into such widely diversified therapies ? it seems to be the idea that hypnosis somehow makes the inner person more accessible when an individual relaxes into a trance state , memories , pains , and traumas as well as solutions and potentials supposedly become more available hypnosis is viewed as a direct route to the unconscious , where old demons can be exorcised with the least amount of discomfort to the patient traumas can be relived and resolved without any conscious participation symptoms can be relieved without any knowledge of their source compulsive behavior patterns can be broken without undue effort defeatist self images can be overhauled in a session or two in effect , hypnotism is based on the belief that the unconscious mind can swiftly heal the patient without the conscious mind ever being involved because of this apparent ease in effecting change , hypnosis has become one of the most popular forms of therapy it is popular from the patient 's point of view because it is like magic indeed , hypnotherapy expressly draws one away from the why the reason for the neurotic symptoms in the first place as a result , hypnotherapy draws patients away from a cure history of hypnosis the first attempt to explain hypnosis in naturalistic terms came in the s an austrian physician named franz anton mesmer proposed that healing could occur through the transference of animal magnetism his procedures became known as mesmerism people still speak of being mesmerized mesmer intended to bring hypnosis into the realm of modern science , but his techniques only contributed to its aura of mystery , magic , and charlatanism dressed in flowing silk robes , mesmer would appear before his patients , who were gathered around a tub filled with water and iron filings these would purportedly help transfer to the patients the marvelous animal magnetism exuding from mesmer at some point the animal magnetism would trigger convulsions in the patients , which would remove whatever symptoms had been present i suspect the convulsions represented a release of accumulated primal energy , which might well yield temporary relief of the patient s symptoms in , a committee of inquiry convened by the king of france discredited mesmer 's ideas the committee found that in fact that no such magnetism existed , and the striking recoveries were due to mere imagination hypnotism was again linked to mysticism and quackery nevertheless , by the s it had spread to various parts of the world two surgeons working independently of each other john elliotson in london and james esdaile in calcutta discovered that the mesmeric trance could be used for pain control during major surgery another th century english physician , james braid , agreed that mesmer 's techniques could be useful he dismissed the concept of animal magnetism , however , and introduced the term hypnotism from the greek hypnos , meaning to sleep this referred to a nervous sleep brought about by a concentration of attention braid believed hypnosis was a sleep state , or at least a state of consciousness existing below the level of conscious awareness these views divorced hypnosis from mesmerism , and tempered the medical profession s negative attitude toward the use of hypnosis in subsequent decades , two scientific viewpoints on the nature of hypnosis crystallized in the mid s , hippolyte bernheim , a professor of medicine at strasbourg , saw hypnosis as a normal phenomenon , resulting from a psychological response to suggestion , and not involving any special physical forces or processes by contrast , jean martin charcot , professor of neurology at the sorbonne , considered hypnosis a pathological phenomenon which occurred only in hysterical patients and which did involve the physical influence of magnets and metals sigmund freud stepped into the controversy in the s a former student of charcot , he became interested in the use of hypnosis as a therapeutic tool for treating neurotic disorders freud found hypnosis useful in helping hysterical patients recall forgotten traumatic events he also used it as a technique to alleviate physical and emotional symptoms in an case study , for example , he described how he used hypnosis to help a woman who was not able to breast feed her child after inducing a hypnotic trance , freud made use of suggestion to contradict all her fears and the feelings on which all the fears were based 'do not be afraid you will make an excellent nurse and the baby will thrive your stomach is perfectly quiet , your appetite is excellent , you are looking forward to your next meal ' freud went on to comment about his remarkable achievement hypnotism successfully alleviated the woman 's physical symptoms , restored her appetite , and allowed her to nurse her child for eight months later , however , while compiling his book studies in hysteria , freud discontinued the use of hypnosis and instead concentrated on the newly developed techniques of psychoanalysis and free association later , he employed dream analysis as the
