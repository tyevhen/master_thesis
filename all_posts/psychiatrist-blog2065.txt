my gansta wannabe child has left home to try his brain at a college course this summer never a camper , this is the longest he 's been away from home so far , life without you i 've been thinking about you and wonder how you are i liked talking to you last night , but a little more info would be okay say hi to your roommate , john , from the unknown place i hope he likes watching the world cup and you find someone up there who is n't a geek i'm glad they found your luggage and you got to bring your clothes with you i hope you wear it if you send me your email address , i 'll write to you even your sister misses you dad tried to give her your seat at the dinner table why ? ask dad he thought she was too far away at the end of the table but she was n't interested love , mom i should have something more interesting from a psychiatric perspective to say about my oldest child growing up , but it 's too hard to think about the fact that soon he will be leaving for good
