rules were always frustrating for me when i was young i usually looked for ways to get around the rules sometimes i was successful and other times i failed but it never stopped me from trying as i have matured , rules tend to make me ponder something , i e , consider their meaning when it applies to my life my daughter posted this on her facebook page yesterday i ve read similar words of wisdom , but this one is short , concise and on target yes , living with kennedy s disease is a physical phenomenon it is also a mental and emotional issue frustration , guilt , anger , fear and embarrassment are all part of the process leading toward acceptance and , these rules are about living a life filled with peace and happiness live in the present take no thought of what others think stop comparing what was to what is realize that you are responsible for your own happiness and , most importantly , living with kennedy s disease is not a death sentence it is a new and different way of living a fulfilling and happy life
