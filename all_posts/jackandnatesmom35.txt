i have to give my little natey credit for someone with limited verbal resources , and supposed impaired communication depends , in my opinion , on what you consider communication , he is certainly making potty training a wild and frankly entertaining ride for mommy and yes , i swear to god , my child is mocking me at this point he continues to resist the potty , crying when we take him , hitting us , screaming no , saying don t like , occasionally don t like potty , don t want anger always makes him use his words , so that s nice to hear when you usually struggle for each word the hitting , not so great , neither is the kicking i am not one to ignore my child s unhappiness , but this is a change in routine for nate he is not going to like it it s out of his comfort zone and for any child with autism this is extremely difficult we just have to work through it he has been communicating his dislike for the potty in other ways as well such as sitting on the potty with me for minutes , walking out of the bathroom and wetting his pants minutes later and then smiling at me or laughing when i say accident and uh oh not funny ok , a little funny he still likes to watch his little social story video about the potty sometimes it goes something like go potty please walk walk walk to the bathroom , pants down , sit down on potty , i m going pee pee etc well i took him to the bathroom the other day and he was not happy about it he sat down on the potty and i whipped out my iphone to show him the story as the app was loading he looked at me with this sarcastic little grin on his face and said walk , walk , walk , and then started laughing mocking me he has never repeated words of a story like that before though , so actually it kinda made me well up a bit he capped off the past few days of fun today by stalemating me from am to almost pm nothing not a drop i decided i would give him a taste of his own medicine we were gonna sit there in the bathroom until he produced some results ! i was working on a test for work while he watched a movie on my phone after about minutes , i looked over and he was going ! halleluiah ! i praised him heavily , gave him some marshmallows he smiled , and proceeded to drop my iphone right into the full training potty ugh somehow , even when i won , he got me ! damn it ! now my phone sat in rice for about hours and is working fine , except the charger won t fit in it , so i suspect a grain of rice is lodged somewhere where i can t see it , which means a trip to the iphone store on the bright side , he stayed dry all day today ! that is the second day so far in let s see , days of potty training , which may not sound like a lot , but it is two more days than he would have had if we weren t trying , so i m pretty happy about it the kid is a force of nature i am telling you , he is smart he is so in there and just taking his own sweet time showing himself to us
