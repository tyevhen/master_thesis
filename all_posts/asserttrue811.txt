introducing bespin from dion almaer on vimeo you should see a video here , but if you do n't , i apologize by now , news of mozilla labs' bespin online code editor is all over the web i do n't think anyone seriously doubts that it 's an idea whose time has come in fact , the timing was rather serendipitous for me , because just a couple of days before the bespin announcement hit , i had spent a morning talking with a friend the cto of a well known software company about a range of development issues , and one of the topics we spent quite a bit of time talking about was remote development you can do remote development and debugging right now , of course with things like eclipse over rmi iiop , if you 're crazy enough to want to do it that way but what my friend and i were discussing was an ajax based emulation of eclipse in the browser not actual eclipse with all its features , but a kind of eclipse light facade over a reasonably powerful set of online dev tools , which would of course include an editor with typeahead and all the rest but that would just be the start we talked about things like static analysis as a service compilation as a service import latest packages as a service jar it all up as a service sanity checking as a service wrap my crappy javascript code blocks in try catches as a service format my fugly code as a service help me oh dear god create osgi bundles as a service translate my java code to some other language as a service give me expanded tooltip help for dojo or other library as a service infinite undo as a service and so on well , maybe we did n't discuss every one of those ideas but we should have ! maybe the bespin guys can add to that list or better yet , implement some of it in any case , let 's do n't stop with just a code editor that 's way too simple we need more than that lots more
