for those who occasionally come to this site , know that i'm in a beta blog fix google and blogspot combined their sign in requirements to promote this new technology , but the sad side effect is that i ca n't comment on my friends' non beta blogs , unless the anonymous feature is enabled as a middle child my sense of fairness bleeds how can i pay people back for commenting here if i ca n't comment in turn ? also , for those not conversant with our fascinating neighbors , recently jailed and released for grand larceny , we had a real blowout with them yesterday they had enlisted us to open a cable tv account and share the expense , since as they operate only on a cash basis they could n't order it themselves the bill was due last week we paid it they did n't kick in their share yesterday i called the company to have their codes shut off they were when bill and darcy came home there was a firestorm how could you do this to us ? do n't you trust us ? we told you we 'd have the money this week jesus ! to which i replied i had already warned them if the money was n't in at the beginning of this week i would do what i said i would do and did i told bill to shut up on the phone i hold the cards here , i said , so do n't fuck with me when darcy called afterwards i told her that due to her protesting as the victim instead of thanking me for getting them service at all , i was inclined not to have the codes turned on for their reception again that 's when darcy came to the door and said , i ca n't believe you do n't trust us after all this time do n't you trust us ? to which kathleen issued a resounding , no i do n't trust you you tried to turn me into your fence darcy was flabbergasted by the term , so repaired to her unit to ask of bill what 'fence' might mean she came back with a diatribe about how all the things she had wanted kathleen to sell were truly hers , that her former landlady who recently had darcy jailed had given these things to her kathleeen stood her ground but i did n't bill brought over a and said keep the change which was n't much change but no doubt helped him satisfy his grandiosity so i weenied out i called the cable company and had them reconnected after all , they did pay me early this week as they said they would i went ahead with the disconnection because i know they 're in hawk to the landlord , who 's evicting them , and thus took a dim view of their credit perhaps the main reason i disconnected them instead of waiting another day or two was because they are television addicts i got a good dose of schadenfreude in taking away their lollipop i have never been to their place when the tv was not on and too loud to talk over , made worse by bill 's need to bloviate about what 's on tv , especially sports what if their story is true ? what if their landlady had offered them all the 'stuff' the police took away ? it is a slim possibility , and in general i give folks the benefit of the doubt so maybe i did n't just weenie out , maybe it was because the quality of mercy is not strained also because i think they would go bonkers without the lullaby of their electronic babysitter , and that sturm und drang would continue in their manipulative whining for the forseeable future their arraignment is today if the bail is low enough they 'll return , or maybe they have resources i do n't know about , cash stuffed away for just such emergencies to buy them their temporary freedom kathleen also questioned darcy how she could rent a car without a credit card darcy claimed enterprise would do it for a cash deposit of she encouraged us to check the facts but were too lazy to do so my jungian shadow confesses to delight in turning their television off , and i knew it would provoke a firestorm , but all in all i did n't want to live near those two if they did n't have television i could have stood my ground and they would have had no recourse as they have no credit card but kathleen , god bless her , did n't budge and was disappointed in my manhood for not standing firm pun unintended on the plus side , i got fifty dollars and put the fear of god into them i have established that i have power to cut their lifeline off with a phone call they have no life apart from television that i can see if they were in hell , i doubt they would notice their surroundings as long as they had a television i'm glad i can blog into the black ether rather than stay chained to the little box of horrors except for his limp , kenyon 's doing find i 've now wrapped his left knee joint with an ace wrap and duct tape , and amazingly , he has n't tried to chew it off kathleen insists that it helps him , as he can bear more weight on the leg i'm not convinced it certainly does n't hurt when i suggested it to the vet she was not enthusiastic but i know now that you can splint a dog naturally as a doctor i'm puzzled by the extra joint in his leg that we do n't have do dogs have two knees ? if so , i bandaged the lower one tomorrow i aim to blog on the men 's circle up here and its preparation for a retreat at the end of the month the theme is the archetype of the magician thine at rodent neutral , ce
