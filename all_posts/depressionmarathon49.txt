it 's not very often i find myself glad to be wrong , but this is one of those cases the pain i wrote about in my last post has gotten better i followed the instructions of the surgical nurse i spoke with on friday i took my pain pill as prescribed for three days , and what do you know ? my pain progressively decreased i'm relieved i'm glad i was wrong , and better yet , i'm happy to report i even learned something from this experience it 's always good when learning occurs at my advanced age insert smiley face emoji here like me , my mother was dubious as to the nurse 's simple instructions she could n't believe that 's all they were going to do as i tried to calm my mother 's concern , i said something aloud which i had never thought about previously it went something like this , well mom , even though this pain is unique to me , it 's probably not unique to them they 've probably heard this hundreds , if not thousands of times , and they know from experience my pain will get better if i just do what they recommend as i said it , i felt a knocking upside my head wow , i thought , that was really profound the knocking upside my head occurred because i realized i 've been in the surgical nurse 's shoes hundreds , if not thousands , of times with my own patients the complaints of my patients , which maybe i dismiss without enough compassion , are unique to them for example , even though i 've seen thousands of total knee replacements , and i know exactly the various pains my patients may experience , my patients do n't have that knowledge i know which of their pains is normal , and i know that pain will improve if they do as i recommend i see their entire course of recovery , and i know how the story ends they do n't i need to remember that when i return to work i need to remember what i just taught myself i think i do a pretty good job of empathetically communicating with my patients , but there 's always room for improvement when i return to work i need to be kind , reassure my patients , and be careful not to come off as dismissive i do n't want my patients to feel like i did on friday i do n't want them to feel dismissed when they express concern over a symptom , unique to them , which i 've heard many times before reassurance is important from now on i will do my best to provide more than just instructions i will work to reassure my patients , too whether suffering from pain , illness or depression , is n't that what we all crave ?
