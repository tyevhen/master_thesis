david is in egypt , from there he will travel to jordan , then to the dead sea , not far from where the savior walked i flew to fresno for several days leaving my nest in the rocky mountains , where it is still winter i heard birds sing , saw flowers blooming , and smelled the cherry blossoms that filled the air with fragrance the grass was a vivid green and leaves were on the trees here in our valley it is winter , but today i saw lavender crocus peaking through the snow in jordan it is summer and david is miles from gaza , where peace is only a dream still in my mind 's eye and in my heart , i hear the words of he who calmed the sea , peace be still
