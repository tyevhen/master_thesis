well , early this afternoon i was dragged to my grandparents on my fathers side house i expected to be bored stiff as usual , since they do n't speak english all that well , and i do n't really speak french at all i do know how to say a lot of simple stuff , i just freeze up when people are actually listening ! however , i was n't really bored for most of the time they spoke english , and i actually talked i think i totally surprised and amused my grandfather by actually having opinions of my own ! i continued reading the teenage liberation handbook , and got even more idea 's of thing to do in the evening , my sister wanted to go see a movie with a couple of friends , so after my mom and i dropped her off we went to my grandmother 's on my mother 's side this time house and i was absolutely thrilled with what she found for me in her basement a newspaper from may of it 's yellowed , cracked , and it 's only a few pages , but i felt goosebumps as i held it there in my hands was an actual peice of history the first world war was still going on , and there is even a list of those who died or were injured the previous day , with names and where they lived there 's an advertisement for shoes that cost it 's downright amazing she also gave me a stack of magazines ranging from ten to sixty years old , and a complete copy of the montreal star from february of i ca n't wait to look through that one as well ! and i decided i want to start a collection of old papers and letters and stuff old writing i'm going to send out a post on freecycle now i need to find out how to safely handle and store papers that are that old my job for tomorrow ! on that same subject , i 've always loved old books and things , but had kind of forgotten about that particular interest until today now i 've been thinking how cool it would be to volunteer in a museum and help the archivist sort through papers and documents i do n't know if helpers in that particular position are usually needed , but i 'd be happy to give it a try to get my hands on all those little windows into another time and place , another human mind anyway , enough ranting on that for now listening to today to lose the way by josh woodward , something i ca n't remember by nirvana reading tlh , ancient newspapers you might also like other bits of history unschooling in the news article on un homeschooling in local paper christmas celebrations linkwithin
