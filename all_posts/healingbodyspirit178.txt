nelson mandella was quoting williams in his second inaugural address our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are more powerful beyond measure it is our light , not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves , who am i to be brilliant , gorgeous , talented , and fabulous actually who are you not to be ? you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wo n't feel insecure around you we were born to manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us , it 's in everyone as we let our light shine , we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear , our presence automatically liberates others
