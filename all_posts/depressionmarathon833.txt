not much to report life is moving along i watched orientation videos at my new job today fortunately , i can access them from home , too , so some of them were viewed from the comfort of my recliner the sad thing is i'm not even close to being done with the videos yet ! speaking of computer access , i did spend a couple hours buying and installing a new router for my wireless home network it was hard to part with the , especially since the router i was using was only years old ! i did n't purchase the same brand this time around ninety six dollars the cost of convenience , i guess i had two good workouts today i started my day with a killer cable strengthening class at the gym i'm going to have sore shoulders and legs tomorrow , i think this afternoon , i went for a minute run with puck my legs were tired , but i'm happy with my training pace these days i 've gotten faster since i began triathlon training i'm looking forward to my rest day tomorrow i'm a little worried about puck he was really lagging behind for the last two miles of our mile run on saturday he seemed overly tired and or sore later , i figured out he 'd worn off the skin between his second and third toes on both of his back feet i think his gait has been altered since he had both acl 's reconstructed it 's either that , or he 's got arthritis in his feet causing him to alter his gait i do n't know , but he 's got red raw skin between his toes i rested him yesterday , and i 've been treating the skin with some doggie foot stuff i also upped his anti arthritis drug he 's healing , but i'm still concerned one of my concerns is leaving him home while i run it 's almost impossible for me to leave without him , and today was no exception he was raring to go as soon as i donned my running gear i tried to assist him by smearing some vaseline between his toes before we left , and i dropped him at home after only miles nevertheless , he still lagged behind for the last mile or so since he seems to begin lagging only after we turn toward home , it 's hard to tell if it 's behavioral , or if he really is in pain i sense a call to the vet in my immediate future well , it 's getting late , and i 've got a full day of patients yippee ! and orientation boo ! tomorrow if any of you have thoughts about puck i 'd be happy to hear them happy to hear any other thoughts , too ! good evening , one and all
