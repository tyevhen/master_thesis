post modern an anti villanelle would suit my mood post modern poetry should not make sense brash metaphor , a narrative that s crude red dog , blue cat , the sawhorse was imbued with hair wash , cut , dye and rinse an anti villanelle would suit my mood a man raking car crash somebody sued my poems for using the pluperfect tense brash metaphor , a narrative that s crude the bearded lady and the dwarf collude the dog faced boy won t howl , take down the tents an anti villanelle would suit my mood grasshopper leaps , the cockroach crawls for food while kilorats gnaw the new testament brash metaphor , a narrative that s crude such blather may result in hebetude while its practitioners say , it s intense ! an anti villanelle would suit my mood brash metaphor , a narrative that s crude i ve been reading a lot of contemporary poetry lately , as i had to review issues of the melic review to pick poems to submit to a net anthology i ve also read three books by an author for a review in the philadelphia inquirer through the good graces of frank wilson in reviewing melic i noticed there seemed to be a fall off near the end of when the poems more and more became verse disconnect , where the primary voice of narrative was buried under layers of scene setting , non pertinent images , and disregard for continuity , with a touch of epiphany at the end but not too much not enough to confer unity on the poem here are three excerpts for your delectation the authors will remain nameless the body s entire expression is self centered in this glyphic hill the architecture of a lost amazon civilization the texture of foam flesh and blood mine ours mingled to form a giant so large he would have difficulty carrying his heart murmur the traffic between worlds , walls we learned to listen to had to ! now here i am on foot among scattered bags taxis ride the plains i whistle at one to bring it down muleskinner and sage a birch rod dips toward sacred words everything 's out of tune tom much of contemporary poetry behaves like this it screams language and syntax are not enough ! we must break it up with interruptions of imagery and bizarre , startling connections it is a collage of words , not a narrative per se i have dealt with such claims in my essays on logopoetry my problem with such poetry is that it is written for poets and aficionados , not for the common reader someone with the equivalent of a liberal arts degree , whether dactic or autodidactic though nowadays i don t know what the degree is worth because of my stance on this i am considered retro , a bit of a dinosaur in most of my poems my hope is that the reader will understand the theme without suffering consternation from images and ideas at cross purposes after this brand of poetry began to invade our magazine , i stopped and put out a call for power lyrics out of some thousand poems we were only able to find about eight that came close to fulfilling our criteria it was plain discouraging we wondered where the poets of our earlier issues had gone i still don t know but i think there was a sea change in , at least in what we were receiving in submissions in any case , my villanelle today likely makes too much sense to belong to the category i invoke , but i did try to make it a little more contemporary than my others it doesn t matter if you like it it exists for itself and that is frequently the attitude i find among contemporary poets , whether mfas or just trendy my poetry is not trendy it aims for the human heart and failing that , the human mind but i sometimes think i was born a little late happily rodent neutral , c e chaffin
