ah , one of our readers asked this it 's one of those questions to which there is no real answer being a doctor takes a long time , it requires reliability , diligence , and a willingness to learn things you may not want to learn organic chem anyone ? ? ? ? and do things you may not want to do it requires endurance and passion you need to be tolerant of many things arrogant supervisors , irritable colleagues , sick people who may not be charming and who may , in their distress , be down right nasty you have to tolerate a militaristic order and be willing to work with a system that may be very difficult , wrong , and demand your obedience in ways that may be uncomfortable oh , i am so happy to no longer be a medical student or a resident in training so can you do it with bipolar disorder ? can you do it with diabetes ? can you do it with attention deficit problems ? can you do it if you 're disorganized or ugly ? the question assumes there is one bipolar disorder , that for everyone it has the same course and the same prognosis some people have an episode a few times in a life , and between episodes , their mood is stable , their emotions gentle others cycle from one mood to another , feeling the whole bipolar thing most minutes of most days some patients with bipolar disorder are in and out of the hospital , behave in impulsive and criminal ways when ill , and ca n't hold any job some do fine with medications and therapy , while others have refractory conditions that defy the most creative of cocktails and the best of therapists , even with their total compliance and some people become doctors and then get bipolar disorder so , maybe what do we think kay jamison would say ?
