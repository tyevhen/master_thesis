i am reading the life of albert einstein now in it is a phrase that he wrote to someone how glorious it is to discover an underlying unity in a set of phenomena that seem completely separate it is an important idea because i think it is the case with primal we have managed to understand enuresis , migraine , high blood pressure , impulsiveness , obsessiveness , phobias and violence due to an underlying unity thus , instead of treating each new appearance of symptoms or behavior de novo , as something unique , we search for the underlying dynamics that give rise to all of those phenomena it makes our job much simpler , and of course , more complex but think of its elegance we don t need a new diagnosis for dealing with phobias of various kinds because there is an imprinted terror lying about that explains it all it eliminates the labyrinthian task of tracking down each new symptom or behavior trying to find the cause here we find a specific time and place where a past event is engraved into our system we no longer have to rely on mystical variables to explain things such as id or shadow forces that past is knowable , even for events during our womb life and moreover it is treatable for a single underlying variable may account for the treatment of most of the separate behaviors or symptoms the imprint we work within the guidelines of evolution to find causes and solutions we know we cannot contravene the evolution of the brain if we want to understand how we become what we are if we remain in the present in our therapy we automatically avoid what surely are the causes of so much deviation we know that behavior is linked to our history , and we if avoid history we avoid cure we no longer rely on the beliefs of the therapist , we relay on the inner truths of the patient hewing to those truths keeps us from going wrong where we part company from all other therapies and theories of mind , is thinking that presenting symptoms are the patient s reality underlying pain unites so much of our lives , behavior and diseases if we do not understand that pain we can never understand a patient s plight it can be a single pain incest that uncovers so much about us it is the unifying principle for neurosis and psychosis , as a matter of fact we can begin to understand the imprint as it simultaneously affects cancer , depression and high blood pressure it ties so many disparate phenomena together
