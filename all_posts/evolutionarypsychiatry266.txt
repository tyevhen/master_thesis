for many , like my beloved texas longhorns , was a difficult year i started the year in a plateau , having gained and lost and gained and lost quite a few pounds during and after pregnancies for my two little girls nutrition was an interest of mine for many years , however i had read good calories , bad calories and the works of micheal pollan , and for years had been avoiding too much fake processed food and vegetable oil but it was n't until i found the idea of a paleolithic style diet that everything began to have focus , and made perfect sense i started out with a nutritionist who had a paleolithic bent but a distaste of fat and a fondness for brown rice and oatmeal nonetheless i would describe his plan as loren cordain meets body for life i followed his plan for months , losing all the excess baby weight and then some , then discovered the primal blueprint , where paleo meets good calories , bad calories , and food and western disease paleo meets academia i added back the fat , ditched the post workout brown rice and oatmeal , and through a perusal of the forums found the wonderful resources of the paleo and traditional foods blogs , and the rest is history none of that had much to do with psychiatry but with my biochemistry knowledge and front lines experience with mental illness , it seemed an obvious route to take with a blog as a population , we are long lived and expensive and sick it did n't seem to me that hunter gatherers could have been so afflicted and survive very long and many of my patients and myself had the look the extra pounds , the flushed skin , the thin hair something was wrong very wrong it is not that hard to find inflammation a new commenter on an older post noted that it seems to be in fashion to blame everything on inflammation and to some extent i agree when i was pregnant , all the little discomforts loose joints , weight gain , bleeding gums were blamed on hormones inflammation is a big word , covering a vast landscape of biochemical processes but it is a place to start , beyond psychology , beyond stress inflammation is where vegetable oil meets the modern stressful life and that is where psychopathology lies as well there are a number of ways to attack psychopathology therapy , exercise , proper sleep and avoidance of addictive poisons and here i focus on food , and parse the details this is science so the definitive is less than we would like but this is science , so we can question dogma fortunately , i have all my friends to parse with me and that is the greatest blessing from not the skinny jeans , the clear skin , or the vibrant hair though those are quite nice the greatest blessing is the community my old friend dan from medical school , gorgeous jamie and julianne all the way in new zealand stephan in the northwest us , dr bg and aaron blaisdell in southern california steve parker in arizona paul jaminet a few miles away in cambridge melissa in nyc thanks to leslie irish evans and robert su for the podcast opportunities ! andrew on his boat enigmatic paleo rock star kurt harris in the midwest dr eades and richard nikoley the commenters and facebook friends and twitter community who are all ready to look at a new angle and take apart a new or old idea tear it apart that 's what leads us forward evolutionary medicine in the st century is a breathtaking enterprise i can be a doctor and use my powers for good my plans for the blog include yes , at long last the thyroid , delving more into phospholipids and the now famous choline , and looking more into sleep i 'll endeavor along the way to keep up with the latest news and papers though i still have a day job , a husband , and two adorable little girls i'm looking forward to a gluten free january , and more pairs of skinny jeans mostly i follow the winds , and my nose , and my gut , which i suppose is more or less what my ancestors did it is nice to be able to use one 's powers for good happy new year
