i'm feeling unusually chirpy for a monday morning the sun is shinning , i 've been pinning on the train and i'm actually not bothered about going into work something 's wrong well , something is wrong actually very wrong i do n't think i 've mentioned the aversion i have developed for the pub every time i even think about going in that place , i feel a wave of anxiety rush over me my heart races , i get all shaky it means getting ready is a nightmare you try applying eyeliner with a wobbly right hand the anxiety does n't stop when i'm there either i have to drink my wine with both hands i know , it 's crazy you see there are few issues with that place for me now obviously first and foremost is mr cba , now a neighbour of the bloody place and in there all the time pretty sure he 's an alcoholic tbh anyway , that 's one thing the second thing is that i kind of got indirectly fired from my job there i know , can you believe it ? me , the mouthy one who always thought she knew better fired ? ! just before my holiday i got in touch with my old manager asking for my once a week shift back his response was not too great he said one night a week does n't really work for him , could i do more shifts ? well obviously not i do n't get in until late monday to friday and i do n't fancy working a seven day week so , that was that no more pub six years of rooting for that place and it 's over i was gutted in retrospect it was probably a good thing if even the thought of having a drink in that place makes me come over all a wobble what would i be like being stuck there for six hours a week my whole six pound an hour pay would be spent on glass breakages i 've been attempting to break this pub phobia or whatever the hell i 've got going on rather than out right avoiding the place i do try to go in , but only with the folks , they understand my madness i had n't been in the pub since well before my holiday i wanted to go in and hand my apron back and ask for my p aka make things awkward on saturday night i went in with the folks it was ok we met up with some friends of ours too and i managed to spend some of the time talking to aka flirting with a few of the regulars obviously mr cba was there i know i should have been adult and mature about things but you 've got to understand how hard it is for me to even look at him , not least hold eye contact when i do i feel all that drama come flooding back , mainly me feeling a massive fool so i completely ignored him it was ok sunday my folks suggested a walk up to the new clubhouse , just opened up the road from their house i thought yea , i might see a few of the familiar pub faces it will be fun as soon as i walk in who 's voice should i hear booming above the rest ? mr fucking cba great i 've pretty much spent my entire weekend indirectly in his company i very nearly turned around and marched back home , instead i threw my bag down on the picnic bench and vented my anger to my folks a few drinks in and my mum was a little drunk it does n't take much , she was only a third of her way through her second half she says 'aw look at him shell , he 's up here with all those couples he could have come to ours for a barbie later what a plonker ' as more of her peroni disappeared the looser she got 'he 's not that bad really i feel sorry for him ' do n't worry , i had a right go at her about that one and then she said 'shall i tell you what dave said ? ' bit of background info dave 's a pub regular who now drinks in the clubhouse , he 's nice , he sits with my folks sometimes for a drink obviously i was intrigued 'he said that mr cba feels a complete idiot , that he does still like you and shell , i 've seen him keep looking at you all wistfully ' firstly i do n't think mr cba even knows what 'wistfully' means , let alone be able to act it secondly , wtf ? ! my drunk mother has just thrown me a fucking grenade i wanted to detonate it right then and there to save myself from the emotional confusion that i knew would follow but to be honest the more i thought about it the better it made me feel i hope it is true i hope he does feel a fool god knows i 've felt like one for long enough so it 's bad right ? its bad i feel good about this ? it 's bad that he is even still on my emotional horizon how i would love to be like 'mr cba who ? ' i'm just not sure i will ever be like that , well not until i fall for someone else anyway also it 's really bad that i 've been thinking about him again i was doing so well oh , and its also really really bad that when i looked at him yesterday i wanted to squeeze his face again squeeze his face and punch it at the same time shit this sucks it 's ok though , i know the cause of all this it 's seeing him i'm planning on avoiding that again for a while
