clinkshrink was talking about how it annoys her when a patient says he hears voices , and with no other information , the nurse records a diagnosis of schizophrenia one of our readers said they would assume that a prisoner who reported he was hearing voices was seeking specific medications presumably for reasons other than to stop the voices or directly treat the symptoms of schizophrenia i read the comment and thought , wait , sometimes people hear voices because they have schizophrenia ! you ca n't just assume he 's drug seeking for devious reasons ! just as one ca n't assume that hearing voices is an auditory hallucination it 's not if the voices are actually there and the result of real people talking , or if it only occurs in the time right before sleep or that the voices are n't the result of hallucinogenic drugs or alcohol withdrawal in a prison population , or the result of another psychiatric illness as schizophrenia is not the only psychiatric disorder where people hear voices , well , we ca n't automatically assume that a patient who hears voices does n't have schizophrenia ! this is why we take a full history and observe patients over time okay , so i'm sitting with two friends in a restaurant and our waiter is really really skinny neither friend is a mental health professional , but we all notice the skinny waiter one friend says i wonder if he has anorexia ? the other friend immediately says , nah , he 's just skinny i said nothing , but i thought , how do you know ? he could just be very slim , or he could have an illness aids , cancer , tb , cocaine they all cause weight loss , or he could have an eating disorder really , all we knew was that he was skinny , that he wore a colorful t shirt , and that he brought us the right food to figure out any more , about either his medical or psychological state , we 'd have to ask questions that just were n't appropriate to the setting still , my friend was absolutely certain the waiter did n't have an eating disorder maybe it 's human nature that we jump to conclusions , but people do it all the time
