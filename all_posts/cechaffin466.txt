recently i boasted to rob mackenzie that i could write a sonnet in fifteen minutes the notion afterwards appeared at some board whose provenance i do n't recall , where people timed themselves on the task in public my effort came in at somewhere around eleven minutes but the one below , penned yesterday , took only five , likely because the form was the substance it 's been said that form is an extension of substance what then if a discussion of form is the substance ? what if the form of the form determines the substance of the substance ? i think form should be second nature for any poet any poet who ca n't write a decent sonnet in half an hour should join a slam team ah , c'mon craig erick , you 're a snob ! damn straight , and we need more snobs in this poetry biz to filter out all the wannabes rhyme and meter are basic to the art at the very least , an aspirant should be able to write decent blank verse sadly , many of my former students had difficulty with both but i squeezed at least one sonnet out of every one of them , even if they whined and sweated blood , though there 's one student out there , and you know who you are , who took a hiatus from the course but has yet to cough up a regular sonnet , likely why he 's avoiding me five beats some prefer their sonnets regular others like them straining against the bones of form like this or this the amateur knows nothing but a pitter pat of tones i like my sonnets rare , not medium i like to break the law i like to tempt my readers to a cliff tedium is all that ever comes from the attempt never to show your underwear in verse i moon you i approve i do i swoon melodramatically inside my hearse beneath the brittle , voyeuristic moon do what you like it s only five beats pound it like abalone or write like keats kenyon swam his heart out yesterday and has been up the stairs twice this morning without a splint kathleen and i plan to get the sunday paper and drive down to a beautiful beach whose name i wo n't reveal there kenyon will frolic and the unluckiest fisherman in the world will lose tackle , bait , and lures to the greedy ocean with nary a fish to show for it i do n't like to let fish get in the way of my fishing at two kilobunnies thine , craig erick
