seems irony has been a common theme for me the past few days yesterday , ironically , almost immediately after writing my sob story post about becoming a non runner , i went for a run not such a big deal except that i actually felt pretty damn okay ! it was snowing and sunny with an intermittent brisk wind have n't seen the sun around here much lately , and the temp rose above degrees , i think ! i kept the pace slow , stopped to walk a few times , but actually ran faster toward the end of my run than at the beginning that is almost always a good sign , as it was yesterday yes , my heart rate monitor was still screaming at me because my heart rate was too high , but i did n't feel like i was going to die this time and apparently , i did n't die , because here i am i went for a run yesterday i finally allowed myself to contemplate becoming a non runner and then immediately proceeded to have a pretty damn okay run ! freud would love this !
