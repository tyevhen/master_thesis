after my last post , a reader asked me what i was thinking well , med , perhaps i write less about my thoughts because they are difficult to sort out or perhaps i write less about my thoughts , and more about what i'm doing , because my thoughts are so distressing right now one of my goals with this blog is to provide some hope to other sufferers , and i'm not sure delineating my thoughts would provide a lot of hope right now it is a difficult balancing act i want to be real and authentic , but i do n't want to drag my readers through the muck that is depression i figure many of you have your own muck to deal with , and that 's not what you hope to get here that being said , i can tell you my current thoughts are not great i try not to focus on them i am feeling hopeless as i 've noted here recently , there is something different about this depression episode i am more discouraged , more hopeless , and more physically stricken than previous episodes suicide is a constant companion no matter what actions i take , things that previously helped , nothing seems to dent the misery and the misery leads to more stinking thinking i'm going through the motions motions are safer than thoughts on good days i take a shower , get dressed , and leave my house more typically , i throw on my sweats and struggle to stay awake today , laundry presents a monumental task somehow , i 'll get it done i 'll also force myself out the door for my short jaunt with puck there will be no attempt at running today no matter what motion i'm taking , i 'll try to stay out of my brain after all , there is nothing worth focusing on in there
