so my weekend went pretty well no major peaks or valleys today s ruined though i ve managed to arrange my life so that i rarely have to leave the house i can sometimes go up to two weeks before having to stick my nose out the door i know it s not healthy and it makes me even weirder when i actually do end up having to deal with people my wife tries to get me out she has none of these issues but it s just so much easier to stay at home but , like i said , today is ruined i have to go to the bank and sign some papers and i have to go get my hair cut since i work best in the mornings i try to schedule mindless stuff like this for afternoons but when i do i spend the whole morning dreading the social intercourse and i don t get any work done so the logical conclusion would be to get this out of the way early and have the rest of the day for my work well , that doesn t work too well , either when i get back i spend the rest of the morning reviewing whatever stupid thing that i might have said and by the time i ve worked through that it is afternoon and i ve lost all motivation to work disgusting , isn t it ? believe me i m far more disgusted than you
