my dog , my boy puck , was attacked tonight we were two blocks from home , only minutes into a mile run we were running our usual route , right past a home we 've run by at least , times before a woman and her large dog came out of the home 's front door before i knew what was happening , the dog broke his leash and ran straight toward puck in an instant , he had his mouth around puck 's neck and puck pinned to the ground i was screaming and attempting to pull the dog off of puck the woman was screaming and attempting to pull the dog off of puck then there was a man in the mix we were all circling around yelling , screaming , and pulling on the dogs the big dog was growling viciously as he tried to shake the life out of puck puck looked terrified he was yelping , as he tried to wriggle free i was certain puck 's body was about to go limp finally , the man pinched the big dog 's leg really hard he told me later , which apparently distracted the big dog , and he let puck go i screamed something really unkind about suing their asses off not one of my better moments , as i raced to gather puck in my arms i was certain he was going to be near fatally wounded , but he was n't in fact , he 's barely wounded at all he has a nasty little gash on one of his ears , but his neck is intact i do n't know how he survived without major injuries i do n't know how he survived period i'm so relieved he 's okay i'm still traumatized by the incident i was so , so scared puck , after he quit shaking , got up and wanted to continue our run we did n't i wish my memory was as short as my dog 's the dog owners , it turns out , were only fostering him for a local rescue society they told me they 'd been trying to give the dog back for several days they were equally as traumatized as i , and they were very apologetic they called the cops , statements were given , and who knows what will happen to that dog now i love dogs , but that was a scary , dangerous dog if puck had been a toddler rather than a dog a toddler would not have survived that attack puck will be ten years old tomorrow he will need a couple of stitches in his ear hell of a birthday present i do n't know what i would do without him i'm so glad he 's okay thank god he 's okay
