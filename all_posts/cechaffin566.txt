the poem below is the fourth in the second half of sine wave which leads from a neutral mood to a manic state as it ascends and intensifies this poem was previously published in river view i think it is mainly the intensity of the language , a language seeking to capture light , that gives this poem a manic air , along with the rather freedom flaunting diction no , it does not reflect my present mood , but that is of no consequence in art for me to be out of synch with my art as i post it makes me more an artist than not my works exist apart from me and my current mood cycle if i have been successful , my poems achieve an existence entirely separate from me or even any consideration of my personality or biography i think i wrote this in oklahoma while attending an oral roberts university conference on christianity and medicine i must have been do n't ask me about the conference or oral i did visit the prayer tower , however apparently oral thought the higher we pray , the quicker we got to god he really should have leased a room in the sears tower imho still depressed , and thinking about oral roberts' prayer tower just makes it worse telephone wires at dusk these wires , iced at sunset with duskfire , have a brightness beside themselves , their taut lengths humming with unknown conversations lipping their secrets electrically through the copper entrails of the black rubber body , transfigured at twilight into phosphorescence of brightwire , a thin white welder s rod of incandescent tongues as if the light could see the cold particulars passing between ears at this second dawn , dying of day and night s birth and if the sun could expose it all by omniscient heliotelepathy and if the words were fire laced with the salt of reason , leaving the burnt scent of compassion in the air if but the words , the words between men i mean , were true as these flaming wires , how beautiful these transient fires would be fit companions of stars published in river view click link for original publication
