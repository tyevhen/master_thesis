posted by dinah in psychotherapy , mother 's day is a two week long event people talk about it the week before and the week after for mothers in intact families , it gets a brief mention there was a nice meal or even some flowers for those who 've lost their mothers , however , it is a rough time , a day when grief re surfaces , when old wounds get spiced in honor of mother 's day , shrinkette has posted some cool pics the secret lives of our parents my best to everyone and , of course , happy mother 's day
