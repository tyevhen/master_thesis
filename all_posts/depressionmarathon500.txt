i'm sitting here with my foot in a bucket of ice trying to abate the tendinitis in my right achilles tendon but tendinitis is not what 's on my mind tonight i'm thinking about money , damn money if there 's one thing that gets me going , it 's financial stress and right now , if there 's one thing i 've got , it 's financial stress dammit ! i hate financial stress ! financial stress almost always makes me resentful of my illness resentment is not a sentiment i can afford , as it , too , will drag me down anyway , i'm resentful of this damn illness , because my financial stress is a direct result of depression before i got sick , i worked full time since the onset of depression , i 've either not worked or worked part time part time is nice it keeps me emotionally stable , but it sucks when it comes to paying the bills and every once in awhile , for various unforeseen reasons , it really , really sucks ! that 's where i'm at right now i opened my checking account last night and found that , as scheduled , all my bills had been paid unfortunately , i also discovered my account balance was zero ! i have another days before my next paycheck comes how did this happen ? well , as i mentioned , various unforeseen circumstances i live on a razor thin line between solvency and insolvency it does n't take much to upset the apple cart i do n't want to go into all of my woes , but my apple cart has definitely been upset this kind of stuff really bothers me i pride myself on being very good with my money i do n't buy anything i do n't need i'm never late paying bills , and i do n't even use credit cards ! no matter what , i take care of my responsibilities seeing a zero account balance , especially when i 've got a week before another paycheck , is not sitting well i do have a small savings account , which i hate to touch , but i guess this is one of the reasons i have it of course , then i worry about replacing the savings account money ! ugh ! like i said , financial stress really gets me going i hate it i hate it i hate it
