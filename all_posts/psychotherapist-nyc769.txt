i recently attended an exhibit at the nyc south street seaport called dialog in the dark where for minutes or so you go through the exhibit experiencing what it 's like to be blind of course , minutes of experiencing blindness could never approximate the actual experience of being blind but this exhibit does an amazing job , giving you a sense of what it 's like before you enter the exhibit , you are shown various videos about blindness and you are instructed on how to use a cane then , you enter into a waiting area where your blind guide , who will be leading you through the exhibit , greets you our guide was a wonderfully patient and upbeat man , kerry from the sound of our voices , he was able to identify each of the seven of us then , the lights dimmed slowly and we found ourselves in total darkness it was so dark that you ca n't even see your own hand in front of you let alone the person who might be ahead or behind you using our canes , we listened for kerry 's voice as he directed us to move forward through an open door he assured us that he knew every inch of the exhibit and that there was nothing to worry about he would help us get through it the feeling of being totally blind and dependent upon a blind guide was surreal using our other senses hearing , touch , smell along with kerry 's help and our canes , we navigated our way through various places , including central park , fairway grocery store , the nyc subway , times square , and a cafe although your rational mind might know that you 're really in any of these places , the exhibit is so true to life that your emotional mind and your imagination put you in those places the subway felt particularly real with the sounds and motion of a moving train it 's amazing how you can lose your sense of time when you 're in total darkness and you 're focusing so deeply on just trying to get from point a to point b to get a sense of what it 's like to get around nyc as a blind person is truly an unforgettable experience that all adults should try i wo n't give away all of the experiences in the exhibit because i highly recommend that you experience it for yourself but one of the unique things that all of us experienced was that , by the time we were almost through the exhibit , we were each using some internal sense beyond our ordinary senses to navigate around afterwards , kerry sat with us in the cafe and answered questions he told us about his own experience of losing his sight when he was a teenager amazingly , he was very positive and upbeat with a jovial sense of humor we were all quite moved by him from the reviews that i 've read , there are blind guides who have been trained for the nyc exhibit and it has been said that all of them are excellent at the end of the exhibit , the lights come back on again slowly we were all grateful for our sight and we came away with a new appreciation for how challenging it is to get around nyc as a blind person if you 're concerned about your safety , you 're told before you enter the exhibit that they have special cameras throughout the exhibited where people are watching just in case someone falls down or gets in trouble but kerry told us that thousands of people have come to the nyc exhibit as well as their exhibits around the world , and they have yet to have an incident this exhibit was developed by andreas heinecke , a german journalist and filmmaker he was awarded the ashoka fellowship award for his work as a social entrepreneur in his ted talk , he talked about what inspired him to develop this exhibit to find out more about dialog in the dark and their various exhibits around the world , go to their website http www dialogue in the dark com i am a licensed nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr therapist , and somatic experiencing therapist i work with individuals and couples to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at
