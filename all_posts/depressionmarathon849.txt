great benefits come from the small shifts that move us into new directions baron baptiste it looks like a gray day is arising here in southern minnesota the squirrels are playing in my yard fortunately , puck is sound asleep , otherwise he 'd be a little nuts no pun intended he 's not a fan of squirrels in his yard the squirrels are running around looking confused i found some nuts hidden near the concrete back steps yesterday the steps are gone now i crushed them with my handy sledge hammer in preparation for my back patio being built if you ever want to feel really powerful , take a sledge hammer to some crush able concrete ! i highly recommend it i'm up watching sportscenter , drinking my coffee , preparing for my day since beginning the triathlon training program , i have n't been able to sleep much later than am , nor stay awake much later than pm pretty boring , but it works for me right now my triathlon workouts are going well yesterday i swam intervals for yards that 's lengths of the pool does n't that sound impressive ? actually , i was pleasantly surprised , because this same workout was a lot more difficult a few weeks ago it 's always nice when workouts get easier after crushing my back steps and taking my daily nap , i returned to the gym to complete the strength training portion of my workout even the strength training felt easier yesterday today i 'll be out looks like the sun is breaking through the clouds on my bike for an hour after hopping off the bike , i 'll run for minutes i tweaked my achilles tendon during the last ten feet of tuesday 's run , so i'm anxious to see how it feels today i pray it will be okay ahhh , who am i kidding ? unless i'm on crutches , nothing will stop me from doing the triathlon at this point it 's only two weeks from today ! two weeks i ca n't wait to see how this all turns out it 's been a long road but then again , is n't that what makes it all worthwhile ? the journey is the destination , right ? baron baptiste , in his book days to a personal revolution , says , the inner revolution of growth is about passing through fires there is no shortcut to achieving skill amen
