i had a lovely dinner party for my birthday yesterday i gathered with other friends at a local restaurant it was really nice to get dressed up and go out i do n't get to do that very often the food and the conversation were good we laughed a lot , took a few pictures , and marveled at me making it to my undisclosed age ! my friend cindy pointed out that it was only two short years ago when i was on disability unable to work because of this illness it was only years ago when i was last hospitalized unable to care for myself because of this disease and it was n't quite years ago when i was self medicating with alcohol daily yet there i was last night , sitting with sober , healthy , fun friends who would have guessed ? certainly not me we did have a lot of fun i ate a huge steak i deserved it after slaving away on the treadmill yesterday ! i ran miles at the gym , miles on the treadmill and miles on the mile track here 's how it went miles on the little track , miles on the treadmill , miles on the track , miles on the treadmill , and finally miles on the track i ca n't imagine doing all of those miles exclusively on the treadmill or the track ! it was horrendous enough having to do them all indoors splitting up the miles helped a little with the boredom , and i think it helped a lot with recovery i'm much less sore today than i was last week after i did miles on the treadmill i'm sure the steak helped , too ! today 's been a day of rest and relaxation i went to church this morning like i mentioned before , i'm sampling a new place i like it , but i swear i'm the youngest one in the pews ! wow ! do n't younger people , and i mean people younger than , go to church anymore ? after church , puck and i went for a long walk it was a beautiful , sunny , clear day unfortunately , it was also quite cold ! i let puck off leash for a while , and he romped around in the deep snow so cute by the time we made our way home , napping was the only thing on the agenda , and that 's what we did like i said , it 's been a day of rest hard to believe it 's almost christmas it 's a bit of a non holiday for me my family does not get together we do n't exchange gifts i do n't send out cards or bake cookies it makes for a stress free holiday for me , but it makes me wish i had a family of my own to create the stress , too oh well , i 'll do my long run and then likely spend some time with friends i guess those friends are my family now , and there 's nothing wrong with that i'm so grateful for my wonderful friends
