before starting our discussion i would like to clarify something regarding the nature of damp heat in damp heat , dampness is the predominant pathogenic factor it is the dampness that is hot , not the heat that is damp in fact , it would be better to call it hot dampness rather than damp heat however , i will continue calling it damp heat because this term is in such common use this means that , in the treatment of damp heat , we must concentrate on draining or resolving dampness rather than on clearing heat however , we do of course use cold herbs too to clear heat i would like also to point out that generally chinese books and doctors overstate the frequency of damp heat and always talk about damp heat , seldom of dampness for example , in china , every urinary problem is due to damp heat , whereas we also see a lot of urinary problems with dampness but without heat , and a lot of urinary problems caused by qi stagnation or qi sinking similarly , any gall bladder problem will always be attributed to gall bladder damp heat , whereas in the west we see a lot of patients with gall bladder problems and dampness but not much heat i discuss here dampness in the context of heat because it is such a common pathogenic factor in many different symptoms and diseases aetiology of dampness external dampness can derive from environmental or climatic dampness thus , it may be due to humid weather whether hot or cold , but also to damp living conditions , such as living in damp houses exterior dampness can also be caught by wearing wet clothes , wading in water , working in damp places or sitting on damp ground seasonal external damp heat is more predominant in summer and late summer , and specifically from the great heat period of the periods of a year to the white dew period , i e roughly two months before the autumn equinox prevailing qi of the place the seasonal is a heavenly exterior factor , the prevailing qi of a place is an earthly exterior factor this is due to prevailing conditions of a place , i e a low lying , damp place , a place prone to fog , damp living conditions in the house , etc internal diet dampness may result from the excessive consumption of greasy foods , dairy foods , sweets , sugar , cold raw foods damp heat may also arise from excessive alcohol drinking together with that of greasy fried foods dampness may also be due to overeating in the same way as retention of food or from irregular eating habits work excessive physical work including sports , exercises , lifting , gym , etc can weaken the spleen and lead to dampness internal injury of spleen weakness of the spleen deriving from a chronic illness constitutional a constitutional weakness of the earth element predisposes the patient to spleen deficiency and dampness on the other hand , a constitutional tendency to a fullness of the earth for example , people with a constitutional tendency to stomach heat may lead to heat in the stomach and spleen which combines with dampness characteristics of dampness the following are the characteristics of dampness it is sticky it is difficult to get rid of it is heavy it slows things down it infuses downwards it causes repeated attacks it is lingering when exterior dampness invades the body , it tends to invade the lower part first , typically the legs from the legs , it can flow upwards in the leg channels to settle in any of the pelvic cavity organs if it settles in the female genital system it causes vaginal discharges , if it settles in the intestines it will cause loose stools and if it settles in the bladder it will cause difficulty , frequency and burning of urination however , dampness is also common in the head and always the cause of sinusitis for example the clinical manifestations of dampness are extremely varied according to its location and nature hot or cold , but the general ones are a feeling of heaviness of body or head no appetite a feeling of fullness of chest or epigastrium a sticky taste a vaginal discharge a sticky tongue coating slippery or soggy pulse according to its location , the more specific clinical manifestations of internal dampness are head feeling of heaviness of the head eyes red swollen eyelids , eyes oozing a fluid , sties mouth mouth ulcers on gums , swollen red lips stomach and spleen feeling of fullness of epigastrium , feeling of fullness after eating , sticky taste , loose stools , poor appetite , soggy pulse lower burner excessive vaginal discharge , painful periods , infertility , turbid urine , difficult and painful urination , scrotal sweating or eczema , genital eczema , genital itching skin papules damp heat with more heat , vesicles dampness without heat , pustules , damp heat with toxic heat , greasy sweat , boils , any oozing skin lesion , oozing eczema , puffy skin joints swollen painful joints fixed bi syndrome luo channels numbness and loss of sensation figure illustrates the classification of dampness treatment principles for dampness there are many treatment principles when treating dampness depending on its nature hot or cold and its location i will discuss only the three major ones drain dampness through urination with bland neutral herbs , resolve dampness from the digestive system and muscles through sweating with fragrant pungent herbs and dry dampness with bitter cold herbs table , and illustrate the main herbs and formulae according to the above treatment principles table bland neutral herbs and formulae for dampness which drain dampness through urination table fragrant pungent herbs and formulae for dampness in the digestive system and muscles which resolve dampness through sweating table bitter cold herbs and formulae for damp heat which dry dampness summary of tastes temperature and actions to summarize the three main treatment principles for dampness with examples of herbs , these are drain dampness through urination , diuretics fu ling resolve dampness through sweating cang zhu dry dampness huang qin these are also summarized in figure figure the three main treatment principles for dampness with sub types damp heat should be discussed separately from heat because it is such a common pathogenic factor that can be the cause of a very wide variety of problems damp heat is particularly important as a pathogenic factor because it itself can become a cause of disease in fact , not only dampness obstructs the qi mechanism leading to more dampness , but heat also dries up the fluids and condenses them into more dampness furthermore , the heat part of damp heat especially if predominant may also injure yin these pathological processes are illustrated in figure figure consequences of damp heat characteristics of damp heat i discussed above the characteristics of dampness here i describe the characteristics of damp heat seasonal character prevalent in summer and late summer , even in countries that are not that hot but are damp in the summer the seasonal damp heat also exacerbates a pre existing internal condition of damp heat e g urinary problems , gall bladder problems , wei syndrome , ms , intestinal problems , etc lingering , long course of disease damp heat is lingering the heat part of damp heat also perpetuates the problem as heat condenses the body fluids into dampness gives rise to phlegm damp heat easily gives rise to phlegm and phlegm heat because the heat in damp heat can condense the body fluids into phlegm manifests with complex symptoms due to the combination of dampness and heat which may give rise to contradicting symptoms and signs for example , the patient may feel hot from heat but the skin may be cold to the touch , or he may have cold feet or the patient may feel cold in general , but he may also get hot easily there may be a feeling of heat but the pulse is not rapid or vice versa there may be a thirst because of the heat but with no desire to drink because of the dampness the bowels may be sometimes loose from dampness and sometimes dry from heat damp heat may injure yin the heat part of damp heat , if predominant , may injure yin this leads to even more complex clinical manifestations , e g the patient has obvious symptoms of damp heat but the tongue has no coating damp heat is frequently toxic toxic heat damp heat frequently gives rise to toxic heat toxic heat is characterized by heat , swelling , pain and often pus a skin bacterial infection causing pustules is an example of toxic heat damp heat easily damages stomach and spleen of course , dampness by itself also damages stomach and spleen but damp heat even more because dampness tends to injure the spleen while heat tends to injure the qi and yin of the stomach symptoms of damp heat the following is a summary of the symptoms of damp heat please note that symptoms such as low grade fever or afternoon fever are not common and they appear only when the heat is pronounced greasy skin weariness ache in muscles night sweating low grade fever feeling of heat body hot to touch afternoon fever rare poor appetite a feeling of oppression of the epigastrium a feeling of heaviness of body and head nausea vomiting abdominal distension sticky taste thirst with no desire to drink turbid urine scanty dark urine difficult urination loose smelly stools skin symptoms of damp heat there are many skin diseases that manifest with damp heat for example , eczema and acne there are three main skin eruptions to consider papules , vesicles and pustules papules papules are red and stick out they may indicate damp heat but they may also indicate heat examples of papules from damp heat are eczema , acne and herpes vesicles vesicles also stick out but are not red and are filled with a clear fluid an example of vesicles is the rash that appears in chicken pox pustules pustules are like vesicles but they are red and filled with pus acne presents with pustules if the skin spots are large , red and painful many signs indicate damp heat such as oozing skin eruptions , swollen painful eyes , sty on eyelids , oozing eyes , mouth ulcers the following three pictures are examples of damp heat the picture below is an example of damp heat with toxic heat when diagnosing damp heat we must differentiate between prevalence of dampness and prevalence of heat because it makes a difference to the treatment in prevalence of dampness we will use bland neutral or pungent fragrant herbs and formulae in prevalence of heat , we will use bitter cold herbs and formulae the following illustrates the differentiation between prevalence of dampness and prevalence of heat in damp heat prevalence of dampness fever , feeling of heat , greasy sweat , greasy skin face pale yellow feeling of heaviness of eyes and head sweet sticky taste , no thirst , likes warm drinks weariness , likes to lie down , feeling of oppression of the chest , likes to be quiet , no irritability poor appetite stools with mucus or watery , turbid urine sticky white or sticky yellow tongue coating pulse slow , weak floating prevalence of heat more fever or feeling of heat , skin not greasy face red slightly red eyes , dizziness , headache bitter taste , no desire to drink irritability , insomnia hungry but no desire to eat constipation , scanty dark urine red tongue body , or red sides , sticky dry yellow coating pulse rapid
