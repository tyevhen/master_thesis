as part of my treatment for depression i try to stay busy and avoid being alone , even though i ca n't stand my own company so i just finished five days with my oldest daughter and grandson jacob , and am now visiting my two younger daughters in long beach , ca yesterday i had to drive to san diego for a doctor 's appointment , about miles from here , a two hour drive after my appointment i stopped at costco for my prescription , then got on the road about pm but i miscalculated it was good friday and the last day before spring break for many students but worst of all , it began to rain and rain hard and nothing so paralyzes socal drivers as that strange liquid it took me four and a half hours to get back to long beach , and i only narrowly avoided rear ending several herky jerky drivers who seemed driven by brownian motion now i used to write a regular column called view from the left coast , but each of the three magazines that featured it eventually went belly up either my column was a curse or this is simply a reflection of the instability of small presses , especially web publications in any event , since my column on socal drivers in the rain is no longer available online previously published in savoy , i reprint it below i would happily write a column for an e zine again but i would insist on being paid not a lot just enough to make me feel like a real writer , not some cyberhackwhore who gives it away for free as i do here ! here 's the column the sky is falling ! with our annual rainfall around thirteen inches , the los angeles basin qualifies as a desert though our climate is labeled mediterranean , a low elevation hike in the foothills will quickly convince you by its spiny barrenness that this is a desert unless you prefer a jaunt downtown , where the traffic court building has huge planters filled with nothing but dirt we survive by stealing water from arizona and northern california see chinatown , though desalinization plants one is currently being tested on catalina island will make all this moot in the future , given technology 's exponential progress the sons of champlin sang why do people run from the rain ? in la we do n't instead we undergo mass paralysis freeways move slower than mississippi mud millions call in sick if nobody walks in la , then when it rains , we need a stronger pronoun than nobody and mad dogs and englishmen has already been co opted by the noonday sun why , when it rains , do our freeways slow to the tempo of blood through plaque filled coronaries ? our road surfaces are good , their drainage is good , there 's really no reason to go less than mph on the freeways when it rains yet magically , when it does rain , the freeways fill like seats for the phantom of the opera when michael crawford was still appearing here 's some possible reasons for this peculiarly la phenomenon , something i 've never witnessed in houston or seattle braking in rain requires longer distances water from puddles can impair brake function it 's harder to see through rain a gray sky makes gray freeways treacherously indistinct people fear rain by force of unfamiliarity not everyone has a suv just yet rain makes angelenos mooningly homesick for their more temperate birthplaces , since anyone who lives here and was born here is a rarity culture shock , or geographic habitat dystonia , i e , rain is natural , and la , artificial the old man is snoring the spermatozoa like rivulets on carnuba waxed jaguar hoods can be hypnotizing leaking sun roofs and convertible tops rain makes one concentrate too much on driving to employ a cell phone effectively all of the above none of the above , again and again i asked my favorite california highway patrol contact , officer judy , to explain the phenomenon ce why is it that angelenos go into paralysis when it rains ? oj is n't it obvious ? ce to you , perhaps oj we have a term for it ce yes ? oj toxic terrapinization ce huh ? oj notice how each driver feels safe in their carapace , err vehicle they can see out the windows of their shell and proceed when rain smears the windows people begin to lose faith in their vision and thus retract their heads and limbs , so to speak , and proceed at turtle speeds with their heads up their asses notice i did n't say tortoise , though perhaps i should , since the tortoise is a desert animal and rain in la forces drivers into an unwanted state of evolution , back into their amphibious past ce are you sure it is n't because they ca n't use their cruise control settings ? oj shit , those are n't any good on our freeways , anyway even at a m ce but do n't the windshield wipers help ? oj oh , no , they make it worse most people do n't know how to turn them on , and those who do are frightened by the noise it reminds them of the score from jaws , another aquatic nightmare ce that 's the silliest thing i 've ever heard oj sillier than a cop named judy , whose initials remind us all of a great friend of the force , or as we affectionately refer to him , bronco man ? strange that grief over his murdered wife nearly drove him to suicide hey , you know if anyone s picked up the reward yet ? rumor has it the killer had a limp and a bad arm ce oh , stop it the smothers brothers show was canceled ages ago and hear i m giving you a second chance for notoriety and you re turning into a bore what , did your mother contaminate your dna sample , too ? oj no , actually , i think that was my dad or a sperm bank ce no wonder they canceled the show , with lines like that oj stop rubbing in the carnuba wax ce ouch ! oj as i was saying , the aqmb air quality management board has succeeded in reducing smog for over thirty years , i 'll have you know , but they have n't made much headway with this other unwelcome toxin as all well informed californians know , rain spoils the lettuce in our irrigated central valley , causes weeds to sprout in our planned communities , and forces the homeless inside , which frustrates do gooders , and worst of all , it can ruin the crease in your chinos in a society where appearance is everything did n't you know most women under thirty iron their jeans ? ce i uhh no oj rain is poison we do n't want it we do n't need it the only people that benefit from the uninvited liquid are the owners of local ski resorts , but they have snow making machines now so who needs it ? someday they may even progress to permanent synthetic snow , the kind which has successfully adorned disneyland s matterhorn for fifty years in short , rain is the enemy of the state mayor yorty told me so himself ce you do n't look old enough to have known him oj give me a break i saw him on videos then met him through channeling , dufus where have you been ? ce i like to read books and don t believe in reincarnation , fyi oj god , you journalistic literary types are so out of it see , rain also interferes with our psychic reception , and that 's big business it 's hard to get a clear reading from mafu when it rains since a lot of people rely on channeling for automatic driving , so they can use their commute time to practice the saxophone or other important business , having their guidance severed is a crippling blow to transportation and commerce ce so you 're telling me that enough drivers depend on spirit guides that when rain impairs communication with the upper reaches , it affects traffic ? oj what planet did you say you were from ? this is la ! per usual , officer judy proved a big help in understanding toxic terrapinization i'm curious whether it affects phoenix and san diego similarly , but not curious enough to go down there and wait for a year just to see some real rain thine in truth and rain , c e chaffin
