this is blog for psychiatrists to talk about issues pertaining to the practice of psychiatry somewhere to talk about ideas , controversies , clinical issues , whatever pushes your buttons it 's fine to vent here , but if you 're talking about a patient issue , please disguise the patient 's identity completely , and if you 're talking about a patient with unique symptoms , change those as well keep the flavor of the problem , but do n't risk breaching confidentiality what this is n't a resource for patients , though i will include some links to other mental health sites this is a resource for docs i'm still trying to find a voice for this it 's my first blog and i'm not sure what i can do with it , so bear with me while i work on getting the kinks out !
