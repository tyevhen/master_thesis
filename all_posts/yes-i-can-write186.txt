i usually do n't shy away from learning about the things that anger me , horrify me , and sometimes break my heart but with the damn oil spill , i 've been avoiding hearing about it as much as i can i feel so incredibly helpless , and every time i think of it i just want to burst into tears even now , we hardly love the earth or see with eyes or listen any longer with our ears , and we scarcely feel our hearts beat before they break in protest stanley diamond but today , i saw this new song on facebook by kimya dawson , an artist i adore , and loved it so i wanted to share it with you it 's called driving driving driving peace , idzie you might also like links on unschooling and radical environmentalism lovely music rise against green anarchy linkwithin
