i think i may have figured out a somewhat suitable solution for my kids get the screamies and i just want coffee problem i run myself into the ground before asking for help i try to do everything myself because that 's what i feel like i should be doing i'm not working , so i need to save money and not get babysitters at least , that is what guilt is telling me honestly , to maintain good mental health , i need to schedule times throughout the week to take breaks whether that 's setting up a babysitter in advance , or talking with my husband about a good time for him to watch the kids , or whatever , i think i could use an hour away a couple days a week any more than two hours and i run out of things to do , or i feel like i'm falling behind on all the tasks two young boys require you to do the thing is though , i 'll do this take care of me priority for like a week , if even that then , things come up and it 's the first to go out the window i'm the first to sacrifice myself when times get tough i know i am going to do it again and again because i 'd die for my family i love them but they are going to kill me if i do n't take care of myself
