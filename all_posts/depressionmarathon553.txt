i'm on my way to bed after running a very long , hot boston marathon this was probably the toughest marathon i 've ever finished it was in the mid seventies at the start , and i believe it was somewhere in the high eighties when i finished the sun was beating down on us from above and the pavement was radiating heat up from below by mile four i was pretty sure i was n't going to finish i kept making little deals with myself about running just to the next mile marker , or even half mile marker , before walking early on i decided to walk up every hill , in order to save my energy , and that 's exactly what i did i ran as much as i could i ate and drank everything that was offered to me i willed my body to go when it just did n't want to move anymore it was tough , but i finished it was one of my slowest marathon times , , but the winning times for both the men and the women were the second slowest and the slowest , respectively , in recent history , too ! it was a long day out there on the road i'm happy to have finished
