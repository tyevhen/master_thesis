last night i pictured myself struggling to shove my trampoline in my back door because winter prohibits jumping outside it would n't fit i love jumping on my trampoline at it keeps me young now i am going to grow old and wear purple or hats with red feathers and expect people to wait on me and take me places maybe that 's not so bad after all no more cooking big dinners
