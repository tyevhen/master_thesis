this time it was an athlete denver broncos wide receiver , kenny mckinley , died from an apparent self inflicted gunshot wound this young man was only in his second year in the nfl he played in games last year , his first as a pro , and is the all time leading receiver at his alma mater , south carolina obviously , kenny mckinley was a talented young man with seemingly everything going for him , and yet he took his life suicide , like mental illness , knows no boundaries black , white , rich , poor , educated or not , nobody is immune i do n't know if mr mckinley suffered from untreated depression the most common cause of suicide but one has to wonder regardless , it 's tragic this is the second time in the last few days i 've been reminded of suicide 's pervasiveness as i ran my twelve miler on saturday , i ran smack into the middle of the out of the darkness walk for two of my twelve miles , i ran side by side with walkers raising awareness the families and friends of suicide victims were obvious , with their coordinated memorial t shirts , and they were everywhere the path was lined with numerous memorial placards photo montages of those no longer here among the pictures , all ages were represented from very young to very old there were students , nurses , bartenders , and more there were pictures of graduations , weddings , beaches , and friends there was loss everywhere it was a powerful event it was odd , being a survivor of a suicide attempt , to be among the families of those who 've been lost suicide 's lasting effect on those left behind was palpable it was good i was there it was good for me to feel that effect as i ran , i quietly thanked god for the reminder , and i said a prayer for each survivor i passed perhaps it was no accident i happened upon that scene i wo n't soon forget it suicide is permanent its effects are devastating if you are considering suicide i get it but please , if you are contemplating suicide , call someone , tell someone now
