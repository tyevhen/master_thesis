this may be old news to others , but i only learned about it just now , and i have to assume there are still people who have n't heard it yet , so it seems the u s patent and trademark office has awarded google a patent for for a floating data center that uses the ocean to provide both power and cooling the patent , granted on april , tells how floating data centers would be located to miles from shore , in to meters of water the technique would obviously use ocean water for cooling , but according to the patent , google also intends to use the motion of ocean surface waves to create electricity , via wave farms that produce up to megawatts of electrical power as a side benefit , floating data centers if located far enough out to sea are not subject to real estate or property taxes more details of how the wave energy machines would work can be found here the interesting thing will be to see where , in the world , google would put its first offshore data center any guesses ?
