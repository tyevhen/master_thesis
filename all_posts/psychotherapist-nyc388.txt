parents , of course , want the best for their children , no matter how young or old they are in an ideal world , we would like them to be spared from heart break , disappointments , and the many potential pitfalls that are out there in the world learn to stop interfering in your adult child 's relationship it 's natural to want to spare them from making the same mistakes that we made but in order to maintain a healthy relationship with your adult children and allow them to learn and grow , you need to know when to let go and allow them to lead their own lives with a minimum of interference learn to stop interfering in your adult child 's relationship this is one of the biggest challenges for parents of adult children learning to let go , allowing them to make their own decisions , and not interfering in their lives this includes not interfering in their relationships with partners or spouses the healthiest scenario for small children is for their parents to allow them , over time , to make age appropriate decisions , based on a particular child 's maturity level and development so , for instance , we do n't allow five year old children to make life changing decisions but we could allow them to choose their own clothes for the day and which books they would like to buy with their allowance money learning to let go and stop interfering in your adult child 's relationship if , over time , children grow up with a sense of age appropriate autonomy and develop good judgment , based on learning to make decisions and learning from mistakes , chances are that they will be better prepared as adults to make more important decisions , including choosing a life partner and being in an adult relationship if we 're constantly telling our young children what to do and not allowing them to make even minor decisions , they are more likely to grow up lacking self confidence and not developing the basic skills necessary to make more important decisions when they are adults does this mean that children who have parents who are always doing things for them and not allowing them to make any decisions for themselves are doomed as adults to make poor decisions about relationships and life in general ? no , it does not even children who have had parents who tried to control their every move can learn as adults to make good decisions it just might be harder and might take them longer than children who 've learned over time to gain self confidence and good judgment by starting to make age appropriate decisions from a young age the following vignette , which is a composite of many different stories , is an example of a parent attempting to interfere inappropriately in her adult child 's relationship mary was in her mid s and when she and her new husband discovered that she was pregnant as a young mother , mary felt very insecure and anxious she also became very controlling with her son , ed , as he was growing up , but she had no awareness of this her husband tried to talk to her about it , but she would n't listen she was so fearful that he would get hurt or make a mistake that she watched him like a hawk when they were at the playground , she repeatedly told him to be careful on the juggle gym and the slides she became upset when he fell and bruised his knees ed 's pediatrician and mary 's friends also tried to tell her that she needed to relax but mary could n't help herself she wanted to spare her son of any kind of physical or emotional pain of course , this was impossible and , as her husband , her friends , and the doctor tried to tell her , her anxiety and vigilance adversely affected ed so that he was insecure whenever he had to do anything new or make even the smallest decision he looked to her to solve his problems and make decisions for him , which she was all too willing to do this began to change when ed reached adolescence he became rebellious and resented mary 's intrusiveness he wanted to have more independence , but mary was unable to allow it this led to power struggles between mary and ed ed 's father was somewhat passive and although he did n't agree with mary , he had stopped trying to get her to see what she was doing ed struggled with making decisions during his early days in high school , he began hanging out with a rough crowd and started cutting classes he refused to listen to mary or his father because he wanted so much to prove to them that he was his own person he also refused to listen to his school guidance counselor when his grades began to slip but when one of his teenage friends died suddenly of alcohol poisoning , ed was very badly shaken up , and he saw the wisdom of the adults' advice from that time on , he applied himself in school and he made friends with serious minded students he salvaged his grades just in time to get accepted at the college of his choice in another state mary did n't want ed to attend college out of state , but he was and , legally , he could make his own decisions in his senior year of college , he became seriously involved with susan , a young woman in one of his classes when he told his parents , his father was happy , but mary worried that ed might be getting involved with the wrong person before she ever met susan when ed brought susan home to meet his parents , the situation was tense susan could tell immediately that , although ed 's father was welcoming , his mother was leery of her susan could n't understand why mary did n't seem to like her susan thought of herself as being a kind , level headed and caring person from a good family she had goals for the future , which she hoped would include ed she was confused by mary 's wariness until ed explained how mary tried to control just about every aspect of his life but , he told susan , he would n't allow mary to control his relationship with her by the time they graduated , ed and susan both got good jobs close to their college , and they moved in together mary , who had been hoping that ed would move back home , was upset that he decided to remain out of state with susan mary tried to persuade ed to forget about susan and come back home all of this culminated in a big argument between mary and ed where he told her to butt out or he would sever his relationship with her he assured her that he meant it and he was prepared to cut her out of his life when she realized that ed meant it , mary was very shaken she did n't want to completely lose her son , so she had a lot of soul searching to do after much thought , mary realized she needed help she consulted with a psychotherapist who helped mary to see how her attempts to interfere in her son 's life had led to the current state of affairs over time , mary was able to admit that she had made mistakes with ed she began to see that she had projected her own insecurities onto her son and this caused ed to feel angry and resentful accepting that ed was an adult and that she had to learn to let go and stop interfering in his life was not easy but mary realized that her relationship with her son was at stake so , she made amends with ed and susan , and she vowed to stop interfering and to respect that they were adults capable of making their own decisions this went a long way toward healing the rift and allowing mary and ed to develop a relationship based on love and
