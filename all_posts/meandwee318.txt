the other day i walked into the living room and could n't find paige i was puzzled as i had n't seen her leave the room i finally saw the top of her fuzzy head peeking out as she had climbed into my office chair she was casually sitting there kicking her feet back and forth on top of the seat she glanced up and smiled at me when i ran over after i got over the shock that she 'd climbed in there all by herself poop , i thought to myself the next day , i came in the room and found paige sitting on the couch casually flipping through my maine magazine how did you get up there ! ? i thought to myself i 've finally managed to catch her doing it she practically puts her foot up near her face and somehow manages to step up onto things it 's crazy i have n't gotten a picture , because usually i'm busy having a heart attack or shitting my pants in fear she will fall on her head while i lunge toward her to make sure she does n't fall because she loves to try standing up and takes a step to casually walk off the edges of things she has n't realized she needs to sit on her bum and lower herself down i'm strictly enforcing the no standing on the furniture rule , but it 's not without a now weakened heart and dirty pants i just glanced over as i write this and she 's sitting on the couch with her head resting on a pillow she looks so content i guess i will have to get used to the idea that she may get hurt , as i ca n't always be right by her side boo time to buy a pacemaker and some new undies see y'all soon ! and i'm kidding about all the pooing and heart attacking for those who do n't get my jokes save you might also like couch potato before and now thank you linkwithin
