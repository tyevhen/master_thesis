i feel really miserable and fed up i had a good day at work , it was office clear up day so i threw a lot of old folders out and cleaned my desk that all went well i had my end of year review this afternoon and that went well and was all positive i should get a pa rise in april i got home from work about pm and watched a spot of tv i spoke to mr apparently creepy guy again then i went to the local pub for dinner the service was really crap but the food was good i was dining alone which was a bit depressing , when i went to order the lady was pretty moody and i ordered my meal for one and she just said what else ? i said that s it and she just mumbled something like ok i moved on to order my drink from the bar and a large party of middle age women got there just in front of me all i wanted was one soft drink but i had to wait for several people to buy their rounds and hand out their christmas cards i am reading the road to nab end , an extraordinary northern childhood by william woodruff i usually like this kind of book because they are living memories of history i love getting sunk in to the old fashioned community that i have not experienced since a very young age one part of the last chapter mentioned bill had an aunty who was deaf and going blind , she was a spinster and none of her family would take her in that s going to be me ! maybe that is what has upset me ? i came home went to bed and cried for a bit after i stopped i just laid there feeling numb so i thought i would post ! i do not think i will go to work in the morning because i feel very low i have set my alarm so i can see how i feel tomorrow but i feel like i deserve a duvet day ! hopefully sleep should fix things ?
