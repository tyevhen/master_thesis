everyone experienced the school time ritual of birthday bumps , right ? i'm not really referring to those kind of birthday bumps today yesterday i turned i still ca n't quite believe it depression has cast a hazy veil across the past couple of years , i ca n't really remember my last few birthdays i 've actually had a poor reputation of enjoying and celebrating birthdays since i was it does n't have anything to do with the gifts , the company or the birthday parties or lack thereof because of me at the age of i realised who my true friends were as we were having a birthday dinner at i failed my driving test on my birthday such a bad idea and did n't want to show my face at sixth form when i was turning i was in the cinema clutching onto a hot water bottle due to post op pain whilst i was at university i turned and had my first birthday experience of going 'out , out' surrounded by some amazing people when i turned i had bright pink hair and was more concerned with everyone else having a good time and at i struggle to remember that year i was n't in the mood to celebrate i was feeling incredibly down , self conscious and really did n't want a fuss made of me , the heat would come to my cheeks and anxiety would sit in my stomach and knotted up in my throat as i unwrapped presents this year , something clicked in my head i could make this day enjoyable by having a good time with those around me i can try to make the day good by controlling as many of the conditions as possible but i also had to remember that it was just like any other day it 's ok if things do n't go to plan , we ca n't control everything depression knows no bounds depression does n't care if it 's christmas , your birthday , someones wedding or whatever other significant event there is depression does not discriminate by gender , ethnicity , sexuality , religion , age or class depression does n't subside for whatever is going on in our lives , we ca n't pick and choose when it affects us we can do our best , we can push ourselves and prepare as much as we can to delay symptoms and attempt to reduce anxieties just remember that we all have a limit , do n't push or be pushed too hard because that wo n't be helpful for anyone i'm glad to see that i 've made progress i celebrated my birthday , something which might seem easy to most people to me that is colossal progress i went out during the day , twice ! i went to busy places , but i made sure we went at times when it might not be too busy and i chose places where i 'd feel slightly more comfortable it can be hard to speak up and take control , but if it gives you a better chance of enjoying a day out or a special occasion , then making your voice heard is worthwhile
