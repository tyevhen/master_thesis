i like facebook , kinda sortof it fits in well with my life as a voyeur , and i get to participate my friends are my friends those on fb , i have some random people there like a carpool mom i do n't really know , and i have a lot of elementary high school folks , some of whom i 've found , and some of who have found me so some of these people who want to be my friends are high school folks i do n't remember okay , maybe the name is familiar , or maybe it 's not they have all the same high school friends in common and they live where i grew up , and hey , who wants to hurt anyone 's feelings , so i 've confirmed pretty much anyone who asks why not ? i 'll tell you why not , because some of these people play all these games on facebook farmville and bejeweled are particularly popular among my peers and who cares if they got a new animal ? but every time i sign on to fb , my news feed is filled with their scores fat doctor oh , she 's the best , but i took her feed off my fb page , though we still remain friends i decided to unfriend the people i do n't know , do n't remember , and who fill up my news feed fb does n't tell you if you 're un friended , right ? only i unfriended some stranger and two days later i got friend request from her , again ! no no no no ! go away ! go play farmville ! you know , i am too old for this stuff
