dr graham emslie , who has participated in a number of psychiatric drug trials for children , appeared in a brief interview clip on an austin tv station s investigation into ssri use among children emslie was contracted by glaxosmithkline as an investigator in a study examining the effects of paroxetine paxil on child adolescent depression as such , he was aware that data showed that paxil was no more effective than a placebo , but and here s the killer quote i couldn t talk about it because it was proprietary in other words , emslie had an agreement with gsk that he would not share their trial data without gsk 's permission , even when it showed that paxil was no more effective than a placebo and related to poorer safety outcomes than placebo this is what i have been beating the drum about repeatedly of note , on his webpage , it is stated that emslie is known internationally for his work in the treatment of pediatric depression perhaps he should also be known as an academic who is willing to suppress results unfavorable to his corporate sponsors of course , emslie should not be singled out at least he had the courage to be interviewed there are many other who have agreed to keep unfavorable data hidden academics have increasingly become puppets of the drug industry if you can t share the negative results of your study , you are acting as a puppet a well paid puppet , but a puppet nonetheless science supposedly involves the disclosure of all of your data especially in the case of medicine , when scientific data are buried , people suffer and die needlessly if anyone wants a good example of why industry and academia need to get out of their shared bed , this is it thanks to ahrp for the link to the video and thanks to k eye tv in austin , tx for running the story direct link to the video here
