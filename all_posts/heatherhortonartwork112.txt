the world breaks everyone and afterward some are strong at the broken places ernest hemingway father , sitting , x , oil on canvas , was painted four years ago my father is an intense person , yet almost painfully sensitive to say he is complex is an understatement i wrote awhile ago about my father in father , hospital , which i have included again below i think that both paintings convey the weight of his personality , or , at least i hope they do with this piece in particular i cropped it in quite closely to accentuate the energy of his personality he does nothing piecemeal and is never mealymouthed about anything he is emotional , at times even mercurial i have inherited this trait from my father i hope to make use of this tendency towards tempestuous feelings within my paintings , because , truthfully , they can really test one 's courage to go on however , would n't you rather a roller coaster than a merry go round in this life ? would you not rather be more predisposed to sorrow , yet have bliss as a welcome companion too ? father , sitting and father , hospital are heavy paintings to me i see in my father the human condition in technicolour , in the flurry of emotions that accompany perennial rumination , and the often in the words of t s eliot there is a shadow under this red rock , come in under the shadow of this red rock , and i will show you something different from either your shadow at morning striding behind you or your shadow at evening rising to meet you i will show you fear in a handful of dust the waste land i like looking at these two paintings next to one another my style has not changed much i would like to think i examine the subject more closely now , paint a little more carefully , and slow down , being more aware of each brush stroke evolution is lovely because it sneaks up on you , and before you know it , you look back on previous work and see that there has been progress , progress that was seamless , invisible and yet its effects evident everywhere you look it is with great happiness that i note that my father is wearing his favorite sweater in each painting like the sweater itself , i find it comforting i am a painter of emotions , pure and simple each tree has a personality , in as much as you or i do each face that i paint is a landscape they are connected we rise and we fall , there are fires in the forest , fires within ourselves , and despite the painful times , there is a beauty and joy that makes it all worthwhile that is what it means to be human , to be alive , to me have a beautiful weekend , whatever adventures you have in store heather if you are distressed by anything external , the pain is not due to the thing itself , but to your estimate of it and this you have the power to revoke at any moment marcus aurelius
