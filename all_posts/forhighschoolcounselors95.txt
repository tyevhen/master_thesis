in a couple of weeks , red ribbon week will be here ! however , i notice that many high schools are not very excited about celebrating red ribbon week and consider it to be a bigger nuisance than a benefit to their school believe me , i totally get that preparation can be a hassle , events take up a lot of time , and you have to help students see the importance of this event however , in my humble opinion , i feel it is our part of responsibility , as school counselors , to educate students , staff , and parents about the dangers of drugs and alcohol in our youth now that some drugs , like marijuana , are becoming acceptable in our society , it is imperative that school counselors be involved in drug prevention and intervention the purpose of this blog includes helping school counselors find accurate drug information and education , targeting red ribbon ideas specifically for high schools , and educating high school parents and staff who often seem clueless truly one way to learn more about drugs and drug use among teens is to talk to students who use or have used substances typically , these students are the ones who can give you the most eye opening information about drug life although , they are rather biased about their use , they can educate you on what you do n't know ok , self disclosure alert i am the relative of a teen who abuses substances i hate it and it saddens me however , i have learned a lot to bring to my profession as a school counselor and to educate parents the signs were gradual and by the time we realized what was going on with our loved one it was too late from my family 's mistakes , i wanted to take time to describe some signs of students when they are using signs of drug use in students change in friends this is huge our relative i will call him nick went from hanging around really positive , outgoing students to a group of friends that just wanted to hang out with each other on the roof of one kid 's house or the basement of another friend they stopped going places like school dances , football games , or social events and only wanted to go to certain friends' homes for the whole weekend change in appearance another big sign is a change in physical appearance nick was known in the family as the clean cut and well dressed kid the kid took at least two baths a day and loved hygiene products over time , we noticed that his physical appearance changed drastically two baths a day went to no baths a day , the kid slept in the same day 's clothing , his teeth were not brushed causing gum disease , and new shoes were worn out after a couple of weeks change in behavior the kid went from doing great in school and dreaming of going into medicine to talking about dropping out of school and living with the basement kid also , nick talked about getting into fights and how he had gotten robbed of his money over the weekend like it was no big deal change in physical well being although nick has a chronic disease , he was relative healthy and managed his illness very well however , one summer , he was in the hospital several times and once on his deathbed unfortunately , a drug test was never given to him because doctors were convinced that his illness was the culprit to his hospitalization honestly , we were too clueless to ask not our sweet kid ! ! change in mood nick went from being a positive , fun loving , and kind soul to the devil i mean you did n't know what you were going to face when you were around him ! in fact , i began to dread being around him and would intentionally stay away from the family to avoid facing this kid change in personality some of the behaviors that we noticed were incessant lying even if he was caught and stealing i had a big jar of change and in one day he got into my room and was able to take all the silver coins out leaving me with only pennies my total loss was , but the real cost was the loss of my trust in him in addition to his sneaky behavior was the fact that he had the nerve to bring drug dealers and buyers to house with my younger child there during the day often young boys would walk from out of the woods up to my home and ask for nick when i would ask about who they were he would just say some kid who wanted to hang recognizing the warning signs now that you know something personal from my family , i hope that you will see that drug use can happen to any kids even good kids so it is important that we , as educators , are aware of early signs of drug use in our students nick started using in th grade and then his use intensified in th grade the paradox is that many of his teachers knew he was using as he showed the signs in their classes , they saw the drug dealers he hung around with during the day , and he was often around the kids who were caught using they never said one word though i wished someone had told on nick , i am not blaming the staff for not saying anything to our family they may have not known what to say or maybe they thought we knew i do n't know as school counselors , we work in gray areas and it is not so easy to always feel comfortable sharing what may or may not be real i know the first time i shared with a parent about their child 's drug use they were completely in denial however , overtime , the parents were able to see the signs for themselves in order to help parents , we must feel confident in our ability and knowledge to identify drug use among our students below are a list of resources that may help you gain that confidence !
