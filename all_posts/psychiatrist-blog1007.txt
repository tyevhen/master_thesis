our state is considering legalizing medical marijuana as a psychiatrist , my first thought is no ! we treat addictions , and we try hard not to cause them marijuana and many other illegal substances may help mood and anxiety in the moment , but they do n't seem to fix things for the long haul and chronic pot smoking decreased motivation , burbles your brain , and does nothing good to your lungs i have visions of patients at the door saying they need me to prescribe pot for their anxiety please , doctor , please but then i think of end stage cancer patients , and it really does n't bother me if a little cannabis helps with their symptoms there are those who claim that oral thc marinol can be helpful for many symptoms , oh , but unliked the smoked stuff , marinol does n't get you high there 's less evidence about inhaled marijuana being effective so here 's my question how does medical marijuana work in your state ? how widespread is the use ? what are the terms and conditions under which it can be prescribed ? who gets it and with what regulation ? is it a good thing or a bad thing and why ? and please , if you have links to data or studies or interesting articles about the legalization of medical marijuana , by all means put them in your comments if you want to tell me why cannabis should be legal and it 's a government plot to keep it illegal and any information from norml , you can hold off on those links i think i 've heard that side of the story
