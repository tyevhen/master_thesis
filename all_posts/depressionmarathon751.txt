my dog does n't know we turned the clocks back last night right on schedule , he was at my bedside wagging his tail unfortunately , today it was am rather than am not that my body knows the difference either i'm not a fan of turning the clocks back i 'd much rather have an extra hour of daylight during the evening , when i'm awake , than in the morning it 's time to get out my sad light , i guess i had a good day yesterday the hole in my heart is healing just a bit i spent the first miles of my mile run letting puck romp through the woods he made me smile , and smile , and smile i love watching him romp free , especially now he is the picture of unabashed joy after dropping him back at home , i finished my miles it was sunny and crisp , and my run went very well i recovered while watching some entertaining college football , took a nap , and then got ready for an evening out last night was my aa group 's monthly celebration of sobriety anniversaries a friend was celebrating one year of sobriety we began the evening with his family at a nice local restaurant it was a bit of splurge for me , but i figured i deserved it after our dinner , we went to the meeting where cakes are presented each person who celebrated a sobriety anniversary in the previous month received a cake last night we celebrated almost total years of sobriety with families and friends it was a night filled with gratitude it was also a good reminder of what i 've been doing over the past several years getting healthy that fact , the fact that i 've spent my time getting healthy , does n't take the sting out of not having children see previous post i'm trying to believe what others are telling me that i was doing important work on myself battling depression and getting sober i'm trying not to waste energy on regret and resentment i do n't know if i'm succeeding i think i 'll always regret not having kids , but i ca n't do anything about it now i 'll let the sting subside with time , but the regret , i'm sure , will always remain resentment , on the other hand , i have to let go i resent the illness which took the option of children away from me and sidetracked my life that 's where i'm stuck now and resentment is n't good for me i have to pray for the willingness to let it go i 'll take any prayers you have , too thanks
