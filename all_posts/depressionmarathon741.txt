after an uneventful flight , i arrived in dallas i 'd never been to texas before so far it looks a lot like minnesota except it 's sunny and degrees ! it was below degrees when i left home this morning the sun and warmth feels really good thankfully , it wo n't be this sunny and warm on sunday , though the forecast calls for lows in the 's and a high of degrees perfect ! after i pick up my number at the expo tomorrow morning , i'm hoping to see the historic west end it 's only a couple of miles from where i'm staying the area includes the spot where jfk was assassinated i 'd like to see more than that , but staying off my feet is more important i actually wish the race was tomorrow i'm anxious to get going this will be the largest marathon i 've ever run i think there are something like , runners ! yikes ! it will be interesting to be among that many moving people i 'll let you know what happens wish me luck !
