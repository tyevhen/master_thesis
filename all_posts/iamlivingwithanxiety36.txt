i recently began pursuing a master s degree after turning in one of my first assignments , the professor posted tips on how to answer some of the questions that s when i began to work myself up oh , there was plenty of time to submit a revision , but i began to work myself up over making the changes i needed to adjust only a few answers , but i felt compelled to review all of my work i wanted to double check all of the answers , not just those few i needed to change based on the professor s advice my mind started to race my pulse quickened and my eyes became blurry then i spotted that i was facing a triviality , and that there was no need to review all of my work i gave myself permission to make a mistake i revised and resubmitted the assignment a few moments later i had a eureka moment , what i m calling a super spot i realized that i am not pursuing a master s degree to be tense , miserable , and in temper for the next months i am pursuing a master s degree to better myself the uncomfortable feelings melted away upon this realization this is now my guiding principle whenever i encounter temper in my studies before recovery , i would have thought about the revised assignment all night , talked it up with friends , and probably triple or quadruple checked my work now that i have recovery training , i feel i m better equipped to pursue a master s degree and my super spot will help me whenever i feel the need to be perfect in my studies
