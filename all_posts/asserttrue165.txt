oil inventories have been growing lately , as you know if you 've been reading this blog we now have million barrels on hand , versus an available physical storage capacity in the u s of million barrels most major and many smaller oil companies have made drastic cuts to capex expenditures for , which means less exploration and new drilling which should slow the pile up of crude stocks , right ? wrong it 's true that many less productive rigs are being idled as of a week ago , only rigs were still active in the u s , down almost from october , when they d peaked at , but here 's the nasty little secret most people outside of the oil industry do n't know many small to midsize producers have no way to service their debt except to sell oil therefore , most are continuing to bring oil to market as fast as they can but also as cheaply as they can , using only the most efficient rigs in fact , the cheaper oil becomes , the more oil these producers have to bring to market to service their debt hence , production will only continue to skyrocket some indication of how serious the situation is can perhaps be garnered from the surprise announcement last friday that the u s government will buy million barrels of oil for the strategic petroleum reserve just a year ago , the dept of energy caught oil markets off guard with a test sale of million barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve thus , the dept of energy has gone from selling oil to being a buyer of reserve oil , in one year it will have little effect , in any case while million barrels may sound like a lot of oil , it represents only one week 's additional inventory surplus , or half a day of production unless the government decides to buy this much oil every week , we 're looking at a continued pile up of to million barrels of surplus oil per week , meaning we might be just weeks away from hitting the absolute storage limit of million barrels as we approach that limit , oil prices will fall , perhaps precipitously , and some producers will default on their debts , a process that has already begun for more coverage of the oil situation , i recommend paying attention to wolfstreet com will the fed raise rates ? lots of talk about the fed meeting this week will they stop using the word patience ? will they talk about raising rates ? will the rate changes happen this summer ? etc let 's remember one thing even if the fed does nothing , the euro which is in freefall will pass through dollar parity on its own , and continue downward if the fed raises rates , the dollar will strengthen at exactly the wrong time , with disastrous effects not only for american industrials but debtor nations and others around the world the fed is by nature cautious i like to think they 're also sensitive to the needs of business and i'm delusional enough to think they wo n't treat the american economy as if it exists in a vacuum they will consider the global consequences of their actions therefore there is no way rates are going up any time soon hopefully , this becomes clear by wednesday the market is rallying on the rumor will it rally on the news , too ? probably this market does n't want to go down the following list of people who retweeted me yesterday might not be complete , but it 's as good as i can do with my silly notifications scraping hack in any case , you should get busy following the folks shown below they 're fantastic twitter networkers , and they retweet ! click their pictures the pics are live links have you added your name to our mailing list ? what the heck are you waiting for , a personal invitation from thetweetofgod ? also please visit hackyourdepression com when you have a chance , and share that link with someone you know who might be suffering from anxiety or depression
