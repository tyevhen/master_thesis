i planned to go home today i was looking forward to lying on the floor snuggling with my dog , breathing in the fresh air , and possibly even running a few steps down the street but it did n't work out that way i did n't go home i'm still in the hospital my mood took a big dive yesterday i was n't overly concerned at the time you and i both know healing from this illness is not a linear process i wish it was i wish it was more predictable but it is n't , and my mood dive lasted into today even after my fourth ect treatment today , i did n't feel a boost when it came time to leave , i was anxious i was worried i was scared i did n't feel ready to go considering the state i was in i did n't want to leave the hospital and then figure out i still could n't function beyond its doors coming back here soon after leaving would really feel like a failure , even though i know it should n't , and i did n't want that to happen so after long discussions with my social worker , the hospital social worker , the hospital psychiatrist , and my own psychiatrist , a mutual decision was made i am staying at least one more night and will see how i feel in the morning this is not exactly what i had planned for today it 's not what i wanted i planned to leave i wanted to leave , but my gut was screaming , no ! i'm still sad and low there 's a possibility i'm now feeling i failed by not leaving and yes , i realize i'm painting myself into a corner failure if i leave and come back , failure if i do n't leave at all that 's a pretty tough position i'm putting myself into , is n't it ? perhaps i need to stop thinking , avoid placing value on each action and feeling , and just accept how i feel it is what it is i'm okay right here , right now i'm safe , and i'm grateful for that it 's not right it 's not wrong it just is
