non state theories theodore barber , a leading hypnosis researcher is a strong proponent of the non state theory for him hypnosis is nothing extraordinary it is a normal , everyday behavior mistakenly given a special name so called hypnotic behavior , according to barber , can be understood as being the result of interpersonal factors , such as the subject 's desire to please the hypnotist by successfully carrying out what is requested of him , much like what often happens between client and therapist in any kind of psychotherapy barber points out that all attempts to define hypnosis to date have involved a semantic merry go round a person is said to behave a certain way because she is hypnotized but how do we know she is hypnotized ? because she behaves a certain way or worse yet a person is in a trance because she is hypnotized how do we know she is hypnotized ? because she is in a trance ! while the concepts of trance and hypnosis are used to define one another , they are also used interchangeably according to barber , proof that hypnosis is a special state of consciousness requires the discovery of behavior other than that used to describe it furthermore , if hypnosis is a special state , should n't instruments clearly indicate its difference from a waking or a sleeping state ? for nearly one hundred years , writes barber , researchers have been trying to delineate an objective physiological index that differentiates the hypnotic state from non hypnotic states the attempt to find a physiological index of 'hypnotic trance per se' has not succeeded specifically , physiological measures such as eeg , blood pressure , pulse rates , and body temperature do not demonstrate any variation between a hypnotic and non hypnotic state peter brown , who has studied what underlies the phenomenon of hypnotic communication , modifies barber 's thesis as follows though there are changes in brain functioning during hypnosis , they are not unique to hypnosis nor are they uniform across all subjects the changes in brain function that occur in hypnosis are similar to the normal ultradian variations in activity and do not appear to differ from changes found in other types of absorbed concentration brown adds that it is easy to speak of an 'altered state of consciousness' or of 'dissociation , ' as if we know precisely what these terms mean the evidence suggests that the trance state involved substantial changes in cognition , emotion , perception , and physiologic regulation but these changes do not exist in a vacuum intermingled with them will be the surrounding context for the individual their previous history , current concerns , and the quality of the interaction and degree of rapport they experience with the hypnotherapist according to the non state theory , the vital functions and behavior of someone in a hypnotic trance are not dissimilar to those of someone who is not in a trance people role play , act , distort , conceal , fantasize , and imagine themselves as others while awake , and they also do these things while hypnotized while either in a hypnotic trance or an everyday trance , they are able to consciously or unconsciously focus on a particular stimulus and tune out all others moreover , barber and other non state theorists say that what happens to people in hypnosis can be explained largely in terms of the relationship between the subject and the hypnotist , based on the subject 's psychology , motivations , and drives as children , they try to please their parents as students , they seek approval from teachers and as hypnotic subjects , they do the same theodore x barber , hypnosis scientific approach new york van nostrand reinhold , , p peter brown , the hypnotic brain hypnotherapy and social communication new haven and london yale university press , , p brown , the hypnotic brain , p
