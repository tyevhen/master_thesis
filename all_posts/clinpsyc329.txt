the interesting thing about corlux mifepristone ru is that no matter how it fares in clinical trials , it is always a winner in the latest trial , corlux was again not effective on the primary outcome measure , which assessed the psychotic symptoms of psychotic depression this is not surprising , since it has generally shown mediocre results , which are then spun by the company executives academics as evidence of treatment effectiveness oh , and despite this being pushed as a treatment for psychotic depression , the treatment has never yielded anything resembling efficacy for depression , which strikes me as pretty odd dr joseph belanoff , corcept ceo , had the following to say about the latest trial results while we are disappointed that the trial did not meet the primary endpoint , we are particularly encouraged to have met the important predefined threshold concentration endpoint with statistical significance , said joseph k belanoff , m d , corcept 's chief executive officer this study confirms our previous observation that at higher plasma levels the drug candidate is able to demonstrate desired clinical effects in particular , those patients in study who achieved a predetermined level of nanograms of corlux per milliliter of plasma separated from the placebo group with statistical significance in other words , there was no difference between any of the three groups taking corlux and placebo none so it appears that they started data dredging e g , running a bunch of atatistical tests until they found one that yielded positive results and found that there was a correlation between plasma concentration of drug and clinical response what the authors fail to note is that does not prove anything one must find results from experimental studies i e , people on drug do better than people on placebo , not from correlational studies , in order to have a solid scientific foothold an academic , who serves on corcept 's scientific advisory board , was also willing to make a sunny statement about the findings ned h kalin , m d , hedberg professor and chair of the department of psychiatry at the university of wisconsin , said , the correlation between plasma levels of drug and response rates found in this trial is very exciting the results of this study show that when psychotically depressed patients achieve a threshold concentration of corlux in their system , a rapid and sustained clinical response is likely this is a strong demonstration of a drug effect in an illness that is potentially devastating and difficult to treat as i am sure ned knows , this was not a strong demonstration of a drug effect if there was a drug effect , then people taking the drug would have generally done better than those taking placebo it is very disappointing when the head of a major psychiatry department makes such statements that would not pass muster in a basic undergraduate research methods class in my view , corcept is really trying their best to keep afloat despite their main product , corlux , showing continually mediocre results please read my earlier posts about corcept 's uncanny ability to always find something positive in their studies , and read health care renewal 's post about corcept hiring a pinch hitter to spin their drug favorably in a journal article bert blyleven 's ability to put spin on a curveball seems strikingly similar to corcept 's ability to put spin on study results
