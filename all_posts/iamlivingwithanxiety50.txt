this past saturday i attended a leaders meeting for my local recovery chapter i struggled with some fearful temper before deciding to attend after all , i would be around people i never met before , and that stirred butterflies in my stomach and led to some blurry vision however , i chose obligation over inclination and decided to attend i knew i could bear any discomfort of course , anticipation is usually worse than realization , and i found everyone to be pleasant and welcoming however , i was startled when the chapter president called on me to handle comments for another leader s example instantly i felt blood rush to my face and my heart pound my mind began to race with thoughts such as , what if i make a fool of myself ? and what if i make a mistake ? i was very self conscious yet i quickly spotted that i was startled , and that it is average to feel uncomfortable in an uncomfortable situation i wore the mask and muddled my way through it i endorsed not only for having the courage to make a mistake , but also for deciding to attend the meeting in the first place even when attending recovery meetings themselves we can find ways to practice ! on a separate note , i found one of katy perry s latest music videos to have an especially encouraging message for those struggling with anxiety
