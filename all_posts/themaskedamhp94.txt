the latest statistics on inpatientsformally detained in hospitals under the mental health act , and patientssubject to supervised community treatment was published on th october this is an interesting and easy to understand report , and i would urge everyone with an interest in mental health and the use of the mental health act to read it this is the third time i have reviewed these annual reports from the health and social care information centre , which is part of the government statistical service the authors clearly love statistics as much as i do my previous reviews are here and here two years ago i wrote what is clear is that , after only two full years of its use , cto s are beginning to seriously impact on the overall use of the mha there appears to be an inexorable rise in the number of people in the community subject to cto s , as once made , cto s can be extended indefinitely one year ago i wrote i quoted from last year s report the total number of people subject to detention or cto restrictions under the act has continued to rise on the st march , this figure stood at , people , representing a per cent increase since the previous year there were , ctos made during , an increase of per cent since last year so what do the statistics show this year ? the report notes that there were , ctos made during , an increase of per cent since last year the report also notes that in spite of larger numbers of ctos being ended each year , the number issued continually outweigh this , resulting in an increasing number in place at the end of each reporting period despite some potentially flawed evidence that cto s are ineffective in keeping people out of hospital , it appears that this is not deterring clinicians from using these orders last year , i observed that , as an amhp , i was finding increasing amounts of my work relate to cto s in the last months , i have been involved in new cto s sec a but i have also been involved in the extension of cto s on occasions sec a and what of my own personal statistics for the last months ? well , a significant amount of my time as an amhp continues to be occupied in work relating to supervised community treatment i was involved in new cto s , i extended cto s , and was involved in revoking cto s these tasks involve an interview and assessment of the patient each time , involvement in s planning meetings , written reports each time i am involved in a new cto , or an extension , or a revocation , and frequently the necessity to prepare managers and tribunal reports and attend tribunal hearings i ve just calculated that i have spent hours in the last year on work relating to cto s that s more than two working weeks it amounts to a significant proportion of the overall time i spend discharging my statutory functions under the mha two years ago i posed the question are community treatment orders taking over the mental health act ? the evidence is increasingly pointing in that direction although of course i am ignoring the increasing time that formal assessments under the mha are taking in general what with problems in finding a bed , coupled with increasingly long delays in getting an ambulance , assessments can often take hours or more , especially when you are covering a large , mainly rural area , with hospitals few and far between however , these latest official statistics cannot cover this area the report makes another , rather telling , statement detentions on admission to hospital increased in both independent and nhs services during for nhs hospitals there was an increase of per cent since but for independent hospitals the increase was much larger at per cent , although the numbers involved were smaller a large proportion of this increase was attributable to a per cent increase in uses of section in independent hospitals this is a continuing trend the report for noted total detentions in independent sector hospitals increased by per cent a large proportion of this increase was attributable to a per cent increase in uses of section last year , i said that over the last year it has become not unusual in my fairly rural area to have to travel miles or more to admit a patient to hospital there have been times when there have been no psychiatric beds at all in the entire region when this happens , the only alternative is to use an independent hospital , at huge expense , of course this has in any case tended to be the default for young people under the age of , and also for people with eating disorders , for whom there are no specialist trust beds in the region at all the continuing closures of nhs psychiatric beds nationwide is not surprisingly continuing to increase pressure on mental health trusts to use private hospital beds i am finding it difficult to understand how the extensive and prolonged use of extremely expensive private beds does not outweigh the savings supposedly gained by the closure of nhs beds , and the reduction in the numbers of frontline clinical staff who might be able to provide alternatives to hospital admission emergency detentions under sec where it is not possible to obtain two medical recommendations continue to reduce year on year in , over people were detained under this section last year the figure was less than , representing almost a reduction overall and what about use of sec police detentions for people in a place to which the public have access ? well , there appears to have been a slight reduction in overall use of this power however , outcomes have not changed in , of the use of sec did not result in detention under sec or sec although there are no figures for the numbers of people detained under sec who are subsequently admitted informally , the overwhelming conclusion to be drawn from these figures is still that the police , who to be fair do not have the training in the identification of mental disorder that mental health professionals have , are still using sec inappropriately
