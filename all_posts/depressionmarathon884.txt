i was cruising along so fine and so fast , and then bam ! now i'm missing my axle not sure how it happened i certainly did n't see that speed bump ahead apparently it was there , in the road , waiting to take me apart if i had seen it , i would have slowed down , maybe even stopped i certainly would have made my way around it instead , i'm sitting here with a broken axle , unable to move forward and unsure what it is i should do next i 've called my mechanics all of them ! it 's nice to talk to them , to e mail back and forth , even to visit they 're very supportive , but ultimately they 're powerless to fix it they do n't stock axles they 've each got parts pieces i might use to mend it they 've got directions and suggestions , but ultimately the axle is mine to rebuild i'm the only mechanic with the tools i 've got to get through this myself and is n't that how it is ? we all have outside input , support and directions the parts are out there , but the tools are ours alone nobody else can pick them up and put us back together again for that , we must rely on ourselves i'm looking through my tools i'm sorting through the parts my mechanics have generously laid at my feet it seems more confusing when taken by surprise , as i was with this speed bump , but i have to have faith it will all come together again no matter the difficulty or confusion , i must take up my tools and rebuild with a little time and perseverance , i pray for reassembly for it is only a reassembled axle which will support my journey ahead
