in our evolution we had the brain stem and limbic structures to handle outside danger but our neuro physiology in all of its wonder also decided how to handle internal danger our stored feelings there seemed to be a migration of cells upward and forward to develop a neocortex that could not only deal with outside menace but from inside , as well deal with is perhaps an exaggeration because what that new neo cortex does is suppress feelings it also connects them to where they should finally go for full consciousness but for the moment let s concentrate on the menace thoughts evolved in part to anesthetize feelings ay ay ay could that be true ? do we have an internal anesthetic that the brain produces ? of course , it is the basis of nearly all pain killers and tranquilizers that mimic the chemicals we produce inside of us so what happened ? well we went from the primtive nervous system to an higher order affair from instincts to thoughts and beliefs , and those beliefs also are wonderful anesthetics witness all of the religions and cults i was thinking about this when i watched tv the other day and saw the ads almost all were for painkillers , aleve , aspirin , tylenol ad nauseum everyone seems to be hurting and almost everyone believes is that an accident ? a strange coincidence ? don t think so some of us take our painkillers straight others go to india to find some belief system so many actually think that some guy in india knows all the secrets of the universe nobody does you know that an expert is a guy from out of town the further we go , the more we expect from the expert so allow me to repeat no one in the world knows more about life than you do all of those secrets of your life lies just below the top anesthetizing level all you need is access , and you will become the expert you wanted from that guy in india we actually need that guy or girl because we are so driven by our unconscious that it is all a mystery for that we need an expert actually , i am that guy and i am not in india i am in santa monica , as mundane and prosaic as that seems the reason i am that guy is i can help you with access to your unconscious i can help you find yourself and your own answers i can never find your secrets out of my own brain that would be ridiculous and oh yes , you think a shrink knows those answers ? guess again , and i underline guess you are buying that guy in india again only now he is in beverly hills in a nice suit if he doesn t help you with access , he is of no use i know i went to those shrinks for battle fatigue or whatever they called it in those days and we did dream analysis ridiculous i know how ridiculous it is , because i practiced it for years when i discovered primal i called many of those patients back and told them i was wrong and i think i have it right now some came back and some didn t they thought they were fine so here we have a feeling system , the amygdala , hippocampus and other structures , and over time some of those wily little cells began to migrate and they formed its antithesis a pure dialectic they formed the anti feeling not to be confused with the anti and the circuits leading upward were much more robust and numerous than the circuits from the cortex to the limbic system now we go to a cognitive insight therapist who insists that the new insights and changed ideas they help you with can change those feelings when everything in neurology militates against it it is far easier for feelings to mount up there than for ideas to go downward and put down feelings still we try , and when we cannot , we use painkillers that simply add to what the brain already produces to shut down pain don t forget that past feelings and needs are engraved into our nerve circuits we are not going to eradicate them so easily and they are not meant to be eradicated , in any case
