photo credit here on the one hand , i love the holidays being able to see family and friends , celebrating gratitude and the birth of jesus , and switching up the routine for a while it can be a time of great blessing and renewal on the other hand , i hate the busyness and the expectations the holidays can bring parties are crammed into a few days meals take so much preparation and planning there are expectations to make sure everything turns out perfect having the right amount of food , civil interactions with family members , finding the perfect gifts , and having to appear a certain way everybody handles the holiday season differently for me , i have an introverted personality large crowds , parties , and socializing drains me , like a battery having the life sucked out of it some people , however , thrive in social environments being in crowds and socializing at parties recharges their batteries and actually gives them energy i have a difficult time understanding this , but i know it is true because my husband is this way it is good to know which type of person you are if you are an introvert like me , or an extroverted perfectionist , you might need these tips to help you have a more enjoyable december or maybe you are an extrovert but the holidays still stress you out regardless , here are some hints to help you thrive during the holiday season , instead of just surviving it unplug from pinterest there are so many ideas on pinterest , it can be overwhelming the cuteness and cleverness is never ending in addition , it is full of unrealistic , perfect pictures in no way does the internet portray real life if you need a recipe or an idea and you must look at pinterest , then set a timer for minutes look it up and move on with your day if you can t handle that , then look something up in an old fashioned cook book slow down nothing is worth doing , if it is taking away your peace and stressing you out work at a pace that is enjoyable to you if you don t get everything done , it s not the end of the world in order to make the actually day of the holiday enjoyable , the journey must also be enjoyable don t let the stress of the preparation carry over into the holiday this past thanksgiving , i made sure to make the preparation as fun as the actual day in turn , doing so made thanksgiving day and all the other parties that weekend more fun adjust the settings on your expectation meter to zero tell yourself right now , it s not going to be perfect and it s not going to turn out how i want but that s ok don t imagine the worst just accept the events as they come lowering your expectations will automatically ease your stress don t consume yourself with what other people might be thinking of you the truth is , they re not thinking about you , they are thinking about themselves so don t beat yourself up about something you said or didn t say don t analyze what you did in certain situations no one is thinking about you if they do , it will only be for a moment and they will move on embrace the awkwardness don t participate in gossip you might understand how harmful it is to other people yet , gossip is just as harmful to the person speaking it if you spend your time talking about others , even if it is good things , you will begin to worry about what other people are saying about you gossip feeds a low self esteem whether you are degrading someone else to feel better about yourself , or whether you are comparing someone s strengths to your weaknesses if you find that you are surrounded by toxic people , people who gossip a lot or make you feel bad about yourself , it is ok to walk away as eleanor roosevelt once said , no one can make you feel inferior without your consent so don t consent to be a part of toxic conversations , even if you are just trying to be polite we , as a society , do so many ridiculous things in the name of politeness don t sacrifice your self worth in order to be polite to someone you barely know quiet your inner critic think of your inner critic , or the voice of anxiety , as a toddler throwing a temper tantrum just like a toddler , if you respond to the crying , you are adding more fuel to the fire ignore the voices in your head that put you down , degrade your self worth , or make you feel like you re not good enough ignore the voices that cause anxiety , perfectionist tendencies , or obsessive behaviors tell yourself , remember , i am not going to do that anymore ! and try to move on lead with your body engage in health routines even if your head isn t there yet if you lead with your actions , your mind will eventually follow remember , you don t have to do anything you don t want to do yet , remember , if it is worth doing , then it is worth a little pain and suffering sometimes during the christmas season , we get so busy with events that we forget to take care of ourselves it is ok to pick and choose which events to attend if something is causing you too much anxiety , whether you are too busy or you just need to take care of yourself , it is ok to say no all in all , we want the holidays to be an enjoyable time , right ? so , instead of focusing on other people s standards , focus on what you need if you are having a good time , more often than not , others around will have a good time as well
