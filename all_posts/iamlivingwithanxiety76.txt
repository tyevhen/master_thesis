when we are anxious , we want instant relief we feel awful , and we lament our situation to anyone who will listen learning to experience these feelings and not blow them up is an important part of recovery training , i ve learned being patient is essential , as well accepting the notion that anxiety won t go away overnight with a magic trick or cure is sobering news yet empowering at the same time it s exciting to know that so many people have gotten better with continuous discipline and practice they ve learned in recovery sure , recovering from a mental illness is hard work , but many major life events can be achieved only by striving toward a long term goal everyday i find myself yearning for relief and comfort , but i now know that these are not the ultimate goal freeing myself from my distressing but not dangerous symptoms is what i really want , and learning to experience and not overreact to these feelings is how i ll get there
