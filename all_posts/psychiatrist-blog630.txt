regular readers know that every year i tweet and blog from the conference of the american academy of psychiatry and law this group of forensic psychiatrists consists of about of the country 's practitioners topics are quite diverse and sometimes rather unusual it 's a lot of fun here 's just a small smattering of factoids i picked up yesterday the sovereign citizen defense can prompt a competency eval , but is not a delusion the sovereign citizen movement is a recognized subculture of people who believe the government has no jurisdiction over them of defendants cleared by dna , one fourth had confessed to the crime according to fbi uniform crime reports , between to of police murders took place while responding to calls involving a mentally ill person the collection and selling of serial killer memorabilia is also a venue for potential fraud president peter ash gave an interesting and useful presidential address about juvenile violent offenders persistent juvenile offenders tend to become more impulsive with age , not less they commit an average of to previous offenses before they are caught for the index violent offense they differ from adult violent offenders in that they tend to act in groups rather than alone , they commit impulsive rather than planned violence , and their criminal activities tend to be more diverse than adults there is a correlation between juvenile psychopathy scores and later adult psychopathy , but this only accounts for ten percent of the variance translation most violent juvenile offenders do not become violent adults nobody knows for sure why there was frequent discussion of the hazards and pitfalls of involvement in social media , including discussion about using it to impeach or undermine witness credibility so far though , when questioned nobody had actually seen this happen to an expert witness concern seems to be out of proportion to reality highlight of the day my favorite part of this first conference day was the luncheon speech by pete earley mr earley is a former washington post report and new york times bestselling author who 's son has a serious mental illness his book crazy is required reading in my training program the book is a description of life inside of one state 's broken forensic mental health system he is passionate and compassionate , and a vigorous and outspoken advocate the audience was clearly captivated by what he had to say , and at sometimes it was frankly hard not to stand up and shout 'amen' ! when he made his points take home quotes for me never give up hope ! people get better ! and a single person can change the system i was thrilled to finally meet this very warm man whom i admire and i'm not just saying this because he wrote a blurb for our book ! sub highlight i attended a presentation about psychiatrists in the media the panel presented an interesting categorization of activities psychiatrist as scientist presenting and interpreting studies , educator , storyteller , celebrity commentator and curbside therapist i was surprised and flattered to see the home page of shrink rap , and the cover of the book , as an example of psychiatrist as educator in the media i'm glad to see we seem to be accomplishing something helpful so that 's the first day you can follow me on twitter see the sidebar if you 're here at the conference and want to occupyaapl , drop me a note !
