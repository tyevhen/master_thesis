this morning , i put on my favorite pair of pants and they were too tight immediately , anxiety filled my mind it was like a sudden summer storm , blowing in from the north , bringing hail and strong winds the anxiety was threatening to level my house i wasn t sure if my foundation was strong enough i couldn t focus on anything else besides the fact that my pants felt too tight i mindlessly walked around trying to finish getting ready i started three or four tasks and never finished any of them i could n't concentrate because my thoughts were occupied with other things i was figuring out how to lose some weight my brain defaulted to , i will cut out sugar and grain i will exercise seven days a week for two hours i will do anything i can to avoid gaining more weight my life is over , as i know it , if i can t fit into my clothes anymore the anxiety grew and snowballed into more anxiety , even though i used some of my coping skills to try and stop it before it was too late i sat down and took some deep breaths i listened to some soothing classical music i wrote what i was thankful for down on a piece of paper i read from the bible and prayed the rosary no matter what i did , the anxiety was there , and i couldn t do anything to get my calm back eventually , i had to cancel my plans for me , it was going to be a relatively busy day i had some commitments i wanted to fulfill however , i couldn t push myself to do any of it from experience , i know when i am past the point of no return and it is better for me to just stay home after several hours , the anxiety is gone and i am left with a heavy weight of depressed feelings i am down because my anxiety kept me from doing what i wanted to do today and i am also down because i still feel fat why do i feel this way ? why is it so gosh darn important for me to be certain size ? how was i so blind sided by this anxiety storm ? why didn t my coping skills work ? before the panic attack set in , i can look back and see that my stomach was upset , and i felt stressed and unhappy my stomach doesn t feel good because it is that time of the month i had a lot on my plate today an extra long to do list causing me some extra stress and i am unhappy because of the underlying depression that is always there and my high self standards that i make myself live up to for me , that is a triple threat the trifecta for the perfect storm physical pain , too much stress , and on the verge of tears ok , so now what ? drum roll , please ! introducing cognitive behavioral therapy retraining your thoughts i have to change how i talk to myself i have to repeat true , uplifting statements over and over i am not perfect not every day can be a perfect day it is ok if i have to cancel my plans and stay home the world will go on without me i am not a failure if i take some pain medication i am not weak for accepting the hurt it is not worth risking a relapse if i have to push myself to the breaking point don t compare myself to others don t compare my failures to other people s accomplishments even if i don t do anything at all today , my life is still important i am still valuable if you were expecting something of me today , i regret to say it will be put off until tomorrow as of now , i foresee a nap in my future being realistic , i should eat a nourishing meal , take a short nap , and go for a walk or jog i know those three accomplishments are the trifecta for a good mood if i can complete those things , that would be good for me if not , i will just try again tomorrow stay tuned for tomorrow s post to find out what happens ! just kidding i ll be fine you take care of yourself now too photo russia storm by craig borchers , photo cottage after the rain storm painting by mary borchers , photo after the storm in naples , florida by mary borchers , photo painting of a single rose by mary borchers
