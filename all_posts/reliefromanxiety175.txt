on the way back from my cycle through germany you can still sponsor me ! i went to france for a day or so i 've always loved france and it 's always been a childhood memory of mine we stayed overnight in a place called lille although it has maintained it 's culture , it 's pretty expensive unfortunately i did n't buy very much , apart from when i went to the market the morning market there reminded me of an old market which would perhaps be found in london unfortunately , the markets where i live do n't resemble this as much it was so busy and so nice to see people buying all their fresh food and handmade gifts , which seemed like such a blast from the past in the evening we found the best cafe i have ever been to it was so old and rustic , with posters of old singers and movie stars all over the walls there was an old fashioned juke box and vinyls everywhere i ended up buying a vinyl by 'the arrogants' which was actually the son 's band of the cafe owners as well as that , a well known belgian dj played vinyls all night , whilst we spoke to some lovely french people i just loved the atmosphere i must say though , i did feel slightly out of place as i know next to no french ! i 've included some pictures below let me know what you think there may not be a blog post next thursday as it 's a level results day next thursday i will know whether i will be going to university or not wish me luck ! i hope all of the hard work has paid off and i have been a victor over my anxiety you can read more about my battle with anxiety and school , here good luck to all who are also getting results ! best wishes amy xx
