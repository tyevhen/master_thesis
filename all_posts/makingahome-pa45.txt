the story of my very first crocheted sweater oh if i still had chubby little babes of my own , you best be certain that i would be cozying them up in handmade sweaters all winter long there is something about a little babe cuddled up inside of a handmade sweater that makes them the babe even more scrumptious , do n't you think ? this sweater was made using a pattern from this book i will say that once i got to the yoke , i was totally lost and had no idea what the pattern was telling me to do ugh i scoured the internet , watched youtube videos , and looked at other sweater patterns i had in the hopes that the instructions would click but , hence , they did not but this here girl was determined to finish this sweet little sweater for her nephew yes , i was ! so i totally winged the yoke i attached the sleeves and decreased the neckline and did the button section totally freeform , all the while saying little prayers that it would turn out in the end and all of my work would not be in vain and although there are things that are imperfect , i really do love the way it turned out and the yarn was wrapped up into this little sweater with much love and care and i'm still determined to figure out what in the world that pattern was telling me to do i will figure that out somehow ! because i 'd like to make more of these little darlings , and i'm not even sure what i did to finish it since i was winging it the whole way through ! his party was last evening , and i do think he looks quite scrumptious in his new sweater but , of course , i could always just gobble this little boy up ! linking up to daisy cottage designs off the hook wednesday
