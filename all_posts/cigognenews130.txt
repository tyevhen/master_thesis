the brain s hemispheres a natural cure must coincide with our knowledge of the way the brain is structured first , we know that the brain has two sides , one more feeling and the other left side more thinking , grosso modo also , we know that the right side develops earlier than the left and absorbs so much early trauma long before we can understand it and give it a name we are driven by those right side imprints so that by the time we are born we are allergic , nervous , restless , colicky and choleric bad tempered , and so on so we are taken to the doctor who is mystified we do know that it is the right brain that is active when we retrieve old memories and when we relive those memories , and it is only through that brain that we can get to those memories , very early ones , that were registered on the right otherwise , no matter how much we dig down , when we leave those memories intact , they will continue to drive us but eventually we will need to dig down with the help of the deep right , orbito frontal brain which functions as a dredge to lift up instinct feeling memories to the fore and we don t even have to do it the brain itself , when given the chance , will perform its proper function and if we don t force it , the brain will find the right time to do it , and not process it prematurely we need to take great care about dredging up traumas too early we can get flooding and being overwhelmed , rather than connected to retrieve the memory we need to live on the level of its existence for a time , use the right brain to lift it toward conscious awareness , and bit by small bit integrate parts of the memory into the brain and the entire system thus , we need to de methylate the memory until we do that there can be no profound change in anyone despite all claims to the contrary not meditation , not cognitive therapy , not mindfulness or hundreds of other nonsense approaches that ignore neurobiology no one can make real change when two thirds of our brains are unacknowledged we have the tail and the feet but we still don t know what it is how can we treat it ? see all of wilder penfield
