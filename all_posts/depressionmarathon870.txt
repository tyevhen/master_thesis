i worked two long days yesterday and today between work , my triathlon program , and taking care of puck , i'm getting an awful lot of exercise these days , and i'm pooped ! i'm afraid my blog suffers when work gets long and i get pooped sorry about that things are moving along i'm feeling a little low , but i'm not sure if i'm truly low or just tired this week i was up early every day to get my workout in before the rest of my day began that includes this morning i was in the pool early before work , but i'm not done yet i still have to get minutes in on the bike i figure i 'll ride and watch the olympics that should keep my brain occupied of course , i may fall asleep atop the bike , too ! tomorrow i have a relatively easy minute run then it 's back to the killer strength and swim session monday i'm already looking forward to my rest day on tuesday ! i'm not sure that 's a good sign i think all the work will be worth it in the end , though no word about the potential job yet i did n't have time to call about it this week it 's on my to do list by the way , i did get elected to the track club board of directors it 's a three year term , and i 've already been to my first meeting we have a large , very active track club , so i think i will have no shortage of new things to do i'm honored to serve on the board that 's about all for now i 've gotta get on my bike have a lovely valentine 's day , everyone
