it 's hard to believe it 's been one week since puck died the hole in my heart still feels gaping and raw i ca n't get used to my quiet house everything i did for the first time without him was difficult this week even doing the laundry was sad i could n't hear him padding about above my head , as i loaded the washing machine in the basement and when i began cleaning my house , including vacuuming my floor , yesterday , i thought i might collapse in despair i could n't stop crying i cleaned because my house needed it , and because d is coming this weekend i was able to work through the pain and get it done , although it took most of the day i put some of puck 's things away , but i 've left others out his presence is still here even though most of his hair has been swept away it will be really strange when i finally run out of little bundles of black hair to pick up i'm sure there are still a few hiding around here right now it 's been a strange week at work it was alternately difficult and relieving sometimes it was a nice distraction at other times i wanted the people around me to quit going about their lives as if nothing had happened ! could n't they see how much pain i was in ? fortunately , those egocentric thoughts were somewhat rare actually , my co workers have been very supportive and kind everyone knew puck was my family life is moving forward , even though i 'd like to reverse time and erase what happened i talk to my boy a lot it 's habit , and it 's helpful i am awaiting the arrival of his ashes , and i'm in contact with someone who hand makes memorial boxes in which to place them i received the paw print from the vet clinic a couple of days ago actually , i received it on my birthday i recognize every bump , crevice and crease i think i even know which paw they used i was surprised by that but i guess years does lend itself to intimate knowledge of a loved one i miss you , buddy i love you
