people often to come to therapy after their own efforts to heal emotionally have n't worked for them and they realize that they need help from a licensed mental health professional it 's understandable that a big part of the reason why they come to therapy is because they want to feel better , and it 's often the case that when they begin to talk about their problems , they start to feel better but the problem arises when clients stop attending therapy as soon as they start feeling better as opposed to when they have emotionally healed by working through the problem see my article when clients leave psychotherapy prematurely leaving therapy confusing starting to feel better with emotional healing since starting to feel better often begins during the initial stage of therapy , a client who leaves therapy before s he has worked through the problem is leaving prematurely and will usually experience a relapse of the emotional problem because starting to feel better is n't the same as resolving the problem it 's just a temporary alleviation of symptoms until the symptoms come back to the surface again let 's take a look at an example of this in the following vignette which is a composite of many different cases to protect confidentiality jack before coming to therapy , jack tried to deal with his panic attacks around his difficult boss by working out at the gym , attending yoga classes , and talking to friends about it but none of these efforts helped him see my articles workplace coping with a difficult boss and how your workplace can feel like a dysfunctional family leaving therapy confusing starting to feel better with emotional healing when he went to see his medical doctor , his doctor gave him a prescription for anti anxiety medication for short term use and recommended that jack see a psychotherapist to work out whatever underlying issues might be affecting him jack discovered that the medication helped to relieve his panicky symptoms for short periods of time but he realized that , after a while , he needed a higher dose to alleviate symptoms , and he did n't like becoming dependent upon medication so , although he preferred not to go to therapy , he followed his doctor 's advice and contacted me for help after we talked about his family history , both jack and i began to see parallels between his situation at work and his abusive father both men were overbearing and verbally abusive jack 's father was also physically abusive with jack when jack was a child just knowing this was a tremendous relief for jack until then , he felt that he was going crazy whenever he had a panic attack around his boss as jack started to understand that he was reacting to his boss as if he were a child and his boss was his abusive father , he began to be able to separate his current experiences from his childhood experiences see my articles reacting to the present based on your traumatic past at that point , jack decided that he did n't need to continue in therapy anymore because he understood why he was having his panic attacks so , during a period of time when his boss was away on an extended business trip , jack decided that he was feeling better and he would end therapy leaving therapy confusing starting to feel better with emotional healing i tried to explain to jack that the alleviation of his symptoms was probably temporary since he had not worked through the underlying emotional problems his childhood history of being abused involved in his current problem understanding logically was the first step , but it usually does n't resolve these types of problems there was also the fact that his boss was away so jack was n't getting triggered at that point by the boss 's abusive behavior but jack had made up his mind about leaving therapy so , i told him that my door remained open and he could return in the future within a couple of weeks , after his boss returned , i received a call from jack , who said that he was having panic attacks again in one instance , he thought he was having a heart attack and he went to the er after the er doctors ruled out a heart attack , they told jack that he was having a panic attack with heart palpitations , shakiness and sweating and he should seek help from a licensed mental health professional leaving therapy confusing starting to feel better with emotional healing jack said that this was , by far , the worst panic attack that he had ever had and it frightened him to the point where he was now constantly worried that he would have another panic attack we resumed our work that week i began by helping jack to develop internal resources , which are basically coping skills see my article developing internal resources in therapy after helping jack to develop the internal resources to do the therapeutic work , we started doing emdr therapy eye movement desensitization and reprocessing , a mind body oriented type of therapy to work on the current situation as well as the underlying issues that were getting triggered by his unresolved childhood trauma see my articles what is emdr ? , how emdr works part emdr and the brain , how emdr works part overcoming trauma and emdr when the past is in the present as we worked together , jack learned to manage his panic related symptoms more importantly , over time , the emdr therapy helped jack to work through the unresolved childhood abuse he experienced with his father that was getting triggered with his boss see my article mind body psychotherapy the body offers a window into the conscious mind he no longer had panic attacks because the underlying traumatic issues triggering the attacks got worked through so they were no longer there to be triggered see my article experiential therapy like emdr , helps to achieve emotional breakthroughs leaving therapy confusing starting to feel better with emotional healing not only did jack feel better , but his boss 's abusive behavior no longer frightened him in fact , for the first time , jack saw that his boss was really an insecure man who bullied employees to bolster his own low self esteem rather than freezing in panic , jack 's attitude about the work situation was that , although it was unpleasant , he no longer felt threatened by it a few months later , jack found a better job where he felt happier , respected and well compensated summary just like jack , many clients think that their work in therapy is over once they understand their problem and they start to feel better unfortunately , this usually does n't last , especially when emotional trauma is involved an intellectual understanding is a good start , but it 's not the same as actually working through the problem , as jack discovered the working through process necessitates working on a deeper level than just having a cognitive understanding emdr and other mind body oriented types of therapy , like somatic experiencing and clinical hypnosis tend to be more effective and efficient than regular talk therapy when the problem involves emotional trauma emdr when talk therapy is n't enough of course , everyone is different and these types of therapy are n't a quick fix but , as an experienced therapist , i have found that emdr and other mind body oriented types of therapy tend to work faster to resolve trauma getting
