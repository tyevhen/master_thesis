i'm sitting in front of my sad light this morning it 's awfully tough to see my computer screen , but the bigger issue is needing to sit here at all i'm so frustrated this fatigue is really wearing on me it 's so wearing my mood is sinking , hence the need to sit in front of this damn light i'm frustrated because i went to bed at last night i'm frustrated because i could n't stay awake beyond last night in fact , i wanted to go to bed at , but feeling that was too ridiculous , i forced myself to stay awake i slowly pedaled my bike i did weak sit ups and minimal lower leg strengthening i performed all of this in front of my television by pm i gave up and went to bed at least , i thought , going to bed early would allow me to get up early and start my day i set out my running clothes i set my alarm i planned my run and fell asleep yet , here i am , typing hours after my alarm initially blared whoever created the snooze button should be shot ! it did n't matter how loud or long that alarm went off , i could n't wake up i knew the clothes were waiting for me i knew puck was ready always i knew i 'd feel sooooo much better if i got out the door none of it mattered despite going to bed at pm , i could n't pull myself out of bed until am pathetic i have a full day today , and now it 's busier because i still need to run hell , i still need to wake up ! hopefully , this damn sad light will brighten pun intended my mood and my day if not , i'm not sure what else to do
