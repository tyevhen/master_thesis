lately , i 've blogged a lot about mental health and the two books i 've done on that topic , but today i'm going to switch gears for optimum mental health , i 've learned i need to have hobbies or interests one of those interests is getting my k which is technically now an ira to grow in the midst of a turbulent market i spend a fair amount of time on that and i 've done okay up double digits last year up ytd but i'm still perfecting my game at the end of last year , i sent stock picks to a few close friends almost all of the stocks i picked dd , dis , aapl , dnkn , ibb , cost were up sharply by the end of january i think costco was the only loser , down on the month but i felt like an idiot , because i failed to capitalize properly on my own picks ! i spent most of january trying to move money out of the market ahead of downturns , and failed to keep a significant percentage invested on upturns in other words , i held too much cash not enough invested i'm still learning i thought i 'd share my notes with you , though , for what they 're worth going forward , the big story to watch for me , at least between now and summer is the price of oil stocks have been hurt whenever oil goes below but we can just about bet on oil going up between now and summer the question is how much , how soon i'm not one of those who thinks we 're going to re test january lows the closer we get to spring , the less likely that is so far , the oil downturn has been explainable as a supply driven event , but there is i'm sure also a demand component , which has been a bit stealthy by late may , we should be able to see how much demand reduction there 's been due to crappy economies in the u s and europe i 'd expect to see oil reach by july , ordinarily , but if demand is softer than we think , it could have a lot of trouble getting there , with many false runups along the way the level is crucial , because wind , shale sands , and deep water rigs are not economical with oil under i'm sure our saudi friends would love to see oil stay below forever , to stall investment in non saudi sourced energy however , the saudis' power to manipulate the markets is not infinite , and any manipulations will ultimately be short lived , so oil is not a question of if , but when the strong of stomach will want to consider bp and hal as oil goes up the latter , currently share , should hit by spring , barring something weird happening , but this is a weird market , and hal is a volatile stock , so beware the ride could get bumpy if you 're an aggressive investor , do n't wait until spring to begin laying in a few oil related positions the time to act is now , or on any pullback in oil you snooze ? you lose kellogg 's k took a bit of a beating a few days ago and is now on sale at and change down from on feb it will go up you can probably make on your money here in two months , not even counting the stock 's quarterly dividend what 's not to like about kellogg ? significant international exposure what 's to like ? low oil prices that , and the fact that the company has just done a reset on expectations , gotten the bad news out of the way , etc kellogg company got dinged on feb buying opportunity what does the price of oil have to do with corn flakes ? plenty you might already know that the corn in a box of corn flakes costs kellogg about cents processing the corn into flakes costs cents of the wholesale price add about eight more cents for freight and cents for packaging labor is six cents advertising and marketing make up of the total cost , with the remainder accounted for by general and administrative g a costs , warehousing , profits , ceo compensation , and other overhead processing , packaging , and freight all energy intensive account for about of kellogg 's costs raw materials also reflect energy prices , but that 's not so important in the overall scheme of things low oil might save kellogg a penny or two on the corn in the box of flakes if kellogg can shave a couple percentage points off its processing , packaging , and freight , it translates to big bucks , because the company typically grosses billion in sales per year would n't you like to have of that ? bottom line , i think oil will stay low enough long enough to give k some margin expansion leeway while it figures out how to get skyrocketing overhead under control enough said about kellogg what else is worth buying here ? well , i'm a big believer in biotech , but i'm not smart enough to pick individual stocks in this tricky industry , so i like ibb , the biotech index fund it finished up last year , up in the last six months , and it 's up ytd buy it on any pullback and expect to hold onto it for , say , six months i like it right here at and change feb msft is still fairly inexpensive and has a good shot at getting back to the high s later this year you could make in a year , or in two months or it could stay flat , although somehow i doubt it will i do n't think it will revisit any time soon if it does , buy even more of it pick up a little bit now , i say , while it 's still under for diversification purposes , you might want to own some defense stocks lots of good stuff to choose from here , but based on the great looking six month and one year charts , i have to go with northrop grumman noc northrop grumman blue vs the dow red , six month chart right now , aerospace defense is a much safer war disaster hedge than gold , imho , so you should definitely own a few shares of one of the big bomb droppers rtn , lmt , noc , or something in that vein forget gold , i say if you have to own a metal , make it aluminum aa is primed to break out , though i would n't buy just yet so those are my picks , for now noc , ibb , msft , k , bp , and for the strong of stomach , hal let 's see how they do in a few weeks or months now back to our regular programming have you joined the mailing list ? what are you waiting for ? i just made you a ton of money ! meanwhile , i want to thank the following great people for retweeting me yesterday with a big thanks also to hannahroveto , conniefoggles , and yegispnk , whose icons did n't show up below for technical reasons click into these profile pics and follow these guys on twitter ! they retweet !
