in science , it often happens that finding the answer to a particular mystery only leads to further questions that 's certainly the case with the non heme manganese based catalases in bacteria which i talked about in a previous post regardless of origin , catalases faclitate the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen the nearly universal heme based catalase found in almost every living thing comes in large subunit and small subunit varieties but is always fairly big amino acids , in e coli manganese catalases , by contrast , are always fairly small around amino acids but there 's one group of manganese catalases that comes in at to amino acids , more than larger than the typical manganese catalase i wanted to know why why are these catalases bigger ? finding the answer was n't hard i got lucky but the answer only leads to more questions it turns out very few organisms manufacture the big manganese catalase the organisms in question belong to just genera rhizobium , bradyrhizobium , and rhodopseudomonas the closely related mesorhizobium has a mn catalase , but it 's the normal size mn catalase meanwhile , its cousin , sinorhizobium , has no mn catalase the first or so amino acids of the mn catalases made by rhizobium , bradyrhizobium , and rhodopseudomonas align quite well with the normal size mn catalases made by other organisms , the only difference being the amino acid trailer on the end of the long versions i used the alignment editor in mega tantamount to notepad to cut the trailer portion out of one of the sequences and paste it into the blast search field at uniprot org a search against the protein database revealed something quite interesting the trailer portion of the bradyrhizobium mn catalase is a identity match for the enteric bacteria ycif gene which is quite a good match considering the phylogenetic distance between e coli and bradyrhizobium the e coli ycif gene top is a match for the bradyrhizobium ycif gene middle , which in turn is a match for the trailer portion of katn manganese catalase gene of bradyrhizobium , bottom further investigation left little doubt that the big mn catalases are indeed fusion proteins ycif fused to the c terminal end of the mn catalase but what in the world is ycif ? it turns out to be a very widely distributed , highly conserved protein of uncertain function the protein has been purified and its crystal structure determined at resolution , but its function is still uncertain what we do know is that it is stress inducible along with other yci series genes and seems to bind a metal ligand , probably iron and it shares structural features with rubrerythrin , a non heme iron protein implicated in oxidative stress protection in anaerobic bacteria and archaea in e coli strains that have mn catalase , the ycif gene occurs two genes upstream on the ' side of the catalase katn gene because ycif is more widely distributed and more highly conserved than manganese catalase , and because most mn catalase producers including those with the fusion enzyme have an additional , separate copy of ycif , it seems likely to me , anyway that the fusion protein was created by chance in the common ancestor of the rhizobiales when the original katn gene was laid down by a phage or other mobile genetic element in e coli , katn often occurs near phage genes sinorhizobium lost the combo gene entirely , while mesorhizobium which makes a small mn catalase either obtained katn on its own or lost the ' trailer from its fusion protein over time since bradyrhizobium and the others already have a separate ycif gene , it 's a mystery why the trailer portion of the fusion gene continues to exist it might very well provide a favorable enhancement of katn function somehow maybe exploiting iron in an auxiliary catalytic center if the trailer 's doing nothing useful , it should have disappeared over time maybe it did disappear from other rhizobiales members , and just has n't disappeared yet in the three genera that still make the big enzyme i have a feeling the trailer piece does do something useful unfortunately , no one has characterized the braydrhizobium mn catalase yet , experimentally we 'll probably have to wait until that happens to find out what the big enzyme is capable of
