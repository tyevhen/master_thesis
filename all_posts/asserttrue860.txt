the nyc google office takes up a city block word comes by way of the silicon valley insider that google will soon be subletting , square feet of space at its new york city googleplex i 've toured the place , and let me tell you , it 's big the th ave office occupies an entire city block of space , between th and th avenues and th and th streets it 's around k square feet altogether what kind of luck google will have subletting this space in the current economy , i do n't know it 's very inconveniently located , in the meat packing district , a couple miles south of grand central terminal and just far enough from the village to be annoying from what i saw on my walk through , i can tell you that google tends to be rather wasteful of space , by industry standards the cafeteria is the size of macy 's and there 's one conference room for every three employees well , almost , and very few programmers can actually reach out and touch someone despite the lack of walls i 'd say there has to be an average of at least sq ft per employee by the time you factor in all the conference rooms , hallways , etc so there 's only two possibilities either google will try to use its space more efficiently and not lay anyone off at its nyc office after subletting one sixth of its available space or it will lay off a sixth of its manhattan workforce around people or some combination of both my guess is both
