i wanted to make certain that everyone had at least checked the abstract of the latest study regarding antidepressant medication and suicide in children adolescents it 's worth a full read if you can get your hands on it it was a case control study looking at suicidality and actual suicide among both children adolescents and adults in children and adolescents aged years , antidepressant drug treatment was significantly associated with suicide attempts or , ci , cases and controls and suicide deaths or , ci , infinity cases and controls i suppose the only good news that could come from this is that the data did not support a connection between suicidality and antidepressant use in adults sertraline zoloft seemed to have a protective effect on adults , which was surprising in the light of david healy 's various examinations of ssri 's and suicide child practitioners please let the research on antidepressants and youth suicidality suicide inform your work http archpsyc ama assn org cgi content short
