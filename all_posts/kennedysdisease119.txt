this is a follow up post to tuesday 's article on the slide if you have followed my posts over the last seven months , you noticed that i mention the slide often the slide is always a concern , because you never know how far you will come back recover afterwards in this post , i want to discuss the realization that sets in after you recover that realization is another wake up call when you feel yourself coming out of a slide , you cannot believe how good and strong you feel the muscles are working better and everything seems so much easier once again standing up from a chair , performing your exercises , or just standing in the kitchen as you prepare lunch feels great you had forgotten how nice it was not to struggle your mood is better and life begins to settle back into its normal routine i call it the plateau or the life is good stage then you try to do something that was routine only a few days ago and you realize that you lost something in the slide something that might not ever come back again one or more muscle groups are just a little weaker than before it is not that noticeable because the difference is only marginal , but weaker it is i liken it to putting a jigsaw puzzle together for the second or third time then , when you are almost finished you notice a piece is missing the puzzle is still the same puzzle , yet it is now different it is incomplete you search for the piece , but you cannot find it the piece is lost forever and the puzzle will never be the same again like the puzzle , once that muscle or motor neuron is dead , your body will never quite be the same you learn to compensate for the weakened state and , over time , you forget that not very long ago you were still able to use that particular muscle life goes on until the next slide
