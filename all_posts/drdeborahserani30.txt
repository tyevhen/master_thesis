if you 're someone who takes over the counter medications or prescription medicines , you need to become medicine smart what does this mean ? for starters , you should know what your medications are but also what they are treating , why a particular one has been chosen uniquely for you and how to use them according to the national council on patient information and education , here are the most important things to know what is the name of the medicine and what is it for ? is this the brand name or the generic name ? is a generic version of this medicine available ? if so , it may be more cost effective to ask your doctor to prescribe it for you how and when do i take it and for how long ? what foods , drinks , other medicines or activities should i avoid while taking this medicine ? adverse reactions are serious things , so learn what goes and does n't go well with your medications when should i expect the medicine to begin to work and how will i know if it 's working ? are there any side effects ? what are they and what do i do if they occur ? will this medicine work safely with the other prescription and nonprescription medicines i'm taking ? will it work safely with any supplements like vitamins , for instance ? do i need to get a refill ? if so , when ? how should i store this medicine ? some medicines must be refrigerated others need to be in a dark cool place other ca n't be stored near sunlight is there any written information available about the medicine ? is it available in large print or a language other than english ? i always encourage children and adults i work with to become medicine smart it makes treatment all the more effective when you know all the whys , whats , whens and hows about medication one last thing i recommend keep a list of all the medications you take available in your wallet , handbag or on your cellphone in case of an emergency , the medications you take will be at the ready should the information be needed
