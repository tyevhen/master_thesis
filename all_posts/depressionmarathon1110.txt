i'm a little tired i'm a little relieved i'm a little satisfied i'm a little proud and i'm still a little scared my former dbt instructors would be so pleased look at me , living in the gray area between black and white ! but if i am to survive in my new job , my new relationship , and my continued sobriety , gray is the place to be what 's that ? a new relationship ? yup , and that 's all i'm going to say about it for now ! as for my new job , it 's going well monday , wednesday , and friday seems to be working , as it allows me a day of rest in between unfortunately , the minute drive has been longer than i anticipated the wide open , mile portion of two lane road through farm country , combined with the nasty beginning to our winter , has already left me weary the addition of nearly two hours to my work day has n't been easy either ten hour days were not part of my original plan originally , i wanted to work four , hour days in almost all of my depression work experience , it is at hours when my brain slows to a crawl , my memory befogs , and my body shuts down once i accepted a position minutes from home , however , i decided days of driving would be too much so i settled on the hour , every other day schedule instead it did n't dawn on me how much twice daily minute jaunts would add to my day i do n't know why i'm a bit worried about it , but i 've decided to take it one day at a time i know i 've got to give my body plenty of time to adjust to my new schedule before i begin making any decisions about changing it i'm trying to take a lot of things one day at a time right now like the gray area between extremes , living in the moment seems crucial at this time experiencing the moments of a new relationship , staying sober , enjoying a day without severe depression , dealing with my sponsor 's cancer diagnosis and upcoming surgery , and coping with a new , more demanding schedule they are all simpler when i stay in the here and now i'm not perfect at it yet , far from it but keeping the concept in mind allows me the chance to catch myself , and to stop worrying about the past or predicting the future practice makes perfect , right ? i 'll keep practicing will you ?
