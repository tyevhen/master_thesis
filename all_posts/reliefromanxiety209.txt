hello everyone ! today 's post is going to be focused on the good ol' anxiety since we 've been born , people have always told us to face our fears of course , this is easier said than done for some , this will be skydiving and for others it could be to go swimming often , these fears do n't tend to get in the way of everyday life , but for others they do people with anxiety tend to have an increased severity and number of fears which they battle on a daily basis this could be anything from catching public transport , to asking for something as many of you may have read , my biggest anxiety trigger is school if you 've had counselling or therapy which i strongly advise you do if you have n't already it 's a god send you will probably know of something called cbt cognitive behavioural therapy which exposes you to things that provoke your fears and anxiety for me , i had to create a hierarchy of fears or things which provoked my anxiety this went from from the easiest to the hardest cbt takes a lot of willpower and this is often why people find it does n't work on the other hand , not every method is going to work for every person personally , cbt is the best way to overcome anxiety , as you are facing the things that make you the most anxious the more you do the things that make you anxious , the lower your anxiety levels will become until you have little to no problem with anxiety for example i used to get a panic attack every time i tried to catch a bus through cbt , i was made to catch a bus times with friends and times by myself it was extremely hard , but after completing this i grew in confidence and now have little to no troubles in catching a bus however , as many of you anxiety sufferers know , you can have blips this happened with me and so i had to have another go at catching buses again before i could move up the hierarchy now , i am at the top of the hierarchy and although i'm tackling the things that affect my life the most , it shows how much cbt has helped me through my anxiety i'm not saying it 's going to be easy , because the thoughts and the fears you have can be so controlling and overpowering that you may find that you cannot tackle a certain situation at the present time however , if you give it a try no matter how big or little , you have achieved for example , after missing school for a number of weeks , i tried some sort of cbt to get me back to school i first started and got half way to school , and as the days went by i managed to get school however , it did take me a number of weeks to get here , so try not to beat yourself up if you cannot tackle a fear straight away best wishes amy xx
