my friends are my estate emily dickinson emily dickinson said it best as a reclusive woman , her friends were very important to her as an only child , my cousins and friends are my siblings wyll , madison avenue , , x , oil on panel , is a painting of one of my dear childhood friends who i have known since grade i have painted wyll three times over the years , and i have included these paintings below true friends are separated by neither time nor geography they simply are a part of you , and you of them true friends are weavers when you meet after a long absence the threads of your lives are quickly woven together so that soon your dialogue flows freely and your only enemy is the clock , indicating when you must part again there 's a certain comfort in spending time with someone with whom you share a history its like a secret that you both carry with you as you walk along the street , as wyll and i did leading up to the reference shots for this painting it is as though your combined force can take on the world , that this bond is greater than the relationships of the multitudes who pass by on the street wyll and i used to work on a ranch together , leading trail rides and relishing our time with the animals there we worked for nothing , simply the freedom of having our own hour of time at the end of the day to ride whichever horse we chose money was irrelevant we were young , fearless and acutely alive but here we are now years later , in the depths of winter in toronto we walked up a side street off of bloor and i took some shots to consider for paintings i edited out some elements that i did not want to paint in the finished piece it was freezing that day but we were warm , and the energy from our conversation over lunch sustained us , keeping the cold at bay i used a lot of blue in the rendering of the snow i paint rather expressively in that i have not the patience to render each window , each brick in the distance , each blade of grass , but prefer to capture the value , shape and impression of the landscape while focusing with more detail on the figure , the subject of the piece wyll is brilliant she is someone who listens and gives beautifully insightful advice , provides inspiration to me as a person and artist , and truly makes the world a more beautiful place with her in it i am thankful to know her we are both only children and solitary by nature , yet this fact strengthens our kinship we have a silent symbiosis which is rare and i appreciate deeply here are two other paintings of wyll i did in i will write about them individually at a later time but it shows how people and artists change , how technique shifts and personalities coalesce friendships , like everything in life , constantly evolve , so that , as t s eliot once wrote we shall not cease from exploration , and at the end of our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time bloor street west caf , , oil on canvas , x new place , , oil on canvas , x here are some snippets of paintings that will appear in my solo show on newfoundland in november at abbozzo gallery in oakville , ontario i am working steadily on new pieces each day it will be an exciting show ! you can find out more information about the exhibition on my website here one of the paintings has already sold and the show is still months away ! if you are interested in seeing the pieces please contact abbozzo gallery on another note , bravo ! canada filmed a special profiling my work in it will be airing on bravo ! channel all across canada on monday , february th at am eastern standard time i hope you are able to catch it ! it is on at an odd time but thank goodness for pvrs have a wonderful day , heather every experience is a paradox in that it means to be absolute , and yet is relative in that it somehow always goes beyond itself and yet never escapes itself t s eliot
