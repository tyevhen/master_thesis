tomorrow , i'm going to pick up my new iphone mind you , i 've been an iphone owner for about weeks now , and i'm returning a month old iphone to get a s i ca n't wait , the phone arrived today and i 've had to restrain myself from going out in the rain tonight and waiting until tomorrow i'm looking forward to having siri be my personal assistant for weeks now , whenever i look things up or schedule an appointment or send an email or text , i wonder will siri do this ? will it work ? can i tell her to send text messages ? do i need to switch back to ical from my google calendar ? no big deal , right i 'll just tell her to schedule things and my calendar will be revised and moved in a matter of minutes ? can siri phone in prescriptions ? can she preauthorize my life ? i'm excited as though i'm about to move in with a spouse in an arranged marriage so have i built this up in my imagination ? is it too good to be true ? you can bet that if siri texts , roy and clink will be the first to know my new iphone has arrived i'm finally going to be the kid on the blog with the newest toy it 's never happened before ! on another note , i am feeling rather cool our shrink rap book was scraped by a hip hop site ! david would like to be credited with the title for this post who knew ?
