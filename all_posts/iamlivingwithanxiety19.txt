nervous people can find even the most mundane tasks distressing one i recently encountered was a visit to a clothing store this retailer uses commissioned sales clerks , and usually when i arrive i am immediately confronted by a salesperson i feel pressured , awkward , and overall uncomfortable on this occasion i had in gift certificates about to expire , and i was n't going to let my fear prevent me from spending them i planned on going on a saturday , and days before i felt tense and anxious my mind clouded and i had a sense of dread in retrospect , i was hardly being realistic which i discussed in a previous post when saturday arrived , i continued to work myself up , but i decided to do the thing i feared and hated to do instead of making this store the last stop on my saturday shopping trip , i decided to go to the store first i reminded myself it 's not how i feel but how i function that matters , and i encouraged myself to not work up the situation in the preview when i arrived i was immediately engaged by a saleswoman , but she was courteous and helpful then minutes later i left the store beaming i used my gift cards and , more importantly , i did n't let my fear interfere with my everyday life that was worthy of a hearty endorsement !
