a day never passed without my thinking of her so when the message flashed on my cell phone this morning from my high school 's alumnae office , it was a shock , but not a surprise the message stated simply that sister ramona , class of , and long time teacher and principal at flintridge sacred heart academy had passed away this morning she had looked frail at my th high school reunion three years ago but , when i asked her quietly about her health , she shrugged and smiled i'm just getting on in years , that 's all , she said when i flew to the dominican sisters' motherhouse in san jose , ca last may for her th jubilee the anniversary of her first vows as a nun she looked ill i could feel every bone in her back when we hugged but she shrugged again when i asked are you okay ? i'm fine , fine enough , she said you know , i 'd love it if you 'd come back when there are no crowds , just us a couple of days together you could stay here at the convent how often do you get such an offer ? she smiled i 'd love that , too , and i 'll just plan on it , i said her reply was unusually sharp when ? ? ? she asked i mentally paged through my work calendar and other commitments and came up with sometime in the fall she nodded , satisfied i stood there smiling at her , but worried was there unusual urgency in her voice ? was she going to be leaving this life sooner rather than later ? my mind rebelled at the thought , unable to imagine the world and my life without her sister ramona bascom was a legend as a teacher , a principal and , later on , a counselor she touched and changed the lives of generations of adolescent girls , college students and , really , anyone she happened to meet delighting current students april everyone who knew and loved her has a story about how she made a difference in their lives this is mine she came joyously into my life and back to her alma mater for the first time as a teacher in the fall of she taught , among other things , journalism i was a senior , the editor of the school newspaper and planning a college major in journalism but it was n't really journalism that brought us together it was my need for a confidante and her wonderful ability to listen without judgment i 'll never forget a day that fall when i finally told her the tightly held secrets of my troubled home life just as the words and my tears were spilling , the bell rang for the nuns' afternoon prayers she did n't move her eyes met mine go ahead , she said i'm listening and when i had finished telling her my story , feeling anew the shame and fear , she embraced me i know it hurts , she said but what you 've just told me is painful but not unusual a lot of people experience similar things my heart suddenly lightened i looked up at her , relieved that she was n't shocked , disgusted , judging really ? ? ? i said you mean other families are like this , too ? that 's such a relief to hear ! and we talked into the early evening , my shame vanishing in her warm acceptance , my spirit brightened by the fact that she cared so much , cared enough to skip prayers to stay with me some months later , when , to my great dismay , my parents forgot my th birthday , sister ramona did n't i arrived at school to find a treasure hunt map stuck in the door of my locker and spent the whole day between classes hunting up funny little cards , drawings , holy cards and candy how did she know how much i needed someone to remember and celebrate with me ? every day was a celebration sister ramona always put people , treasured relationships , first over prayers or dogma or her own cherished beliefs i felt loved and accepted at every point in my life on my graduation day , she gave me a letter telling me how much i meant to her and outlining all of my positive qualities that she particularly noticed and valued i have treasured that letter for years bringing it out to read again when faced with self doubt or disappointment , depression or simple nostalgia the last time i read it , sister ramona and i sat quietly and read it together during my th high school reunion she handed it back to me , tears in her eyes i 'd say exactly the same things today , she said , embracing me at my th reunion in april but there were times when i must have been harder to accept than others when i was a junior at northwestern university having enjoyed a lively correspondence with her throughout my college years i began to have the crisis of faith that would lead to my stepping away from the catholic church i sent her long , angry , introspective letters about it she finally sent me a letter that said i understand that this is all difficult and quite life changing for you and i'm glad you feel you can write to me about it but i miss hearing about the rest of your life what 's the scoop on your love life ? are you dating anyone special ? tell me more about your new roommate oh , and are you taking any more writing classes with the incredible elizabeth swayne ? i smiled , relieved , knowing that wherever my crisis of faith took me , sister ramona would be there dinner in our den of sin in when i was living in sin with bob , whom i would marry a year later , she came to our apartment for dinner , shocking and delighting bob , a non catholic who had never met a nun before , with her non chalance and her salty sense of humor and even though we were not married in the catholic church , she was there at the wedding , happy for us , and cheering up my mother who was not , at that time , particularly jubilant about the marriage cheering up my mom may when my parents died four months apart in , she suddenly , as if by magic , appeared at both funerals and graveside services , knowing better than anyone there except for my siblings how complicated and deep our journey through grief would be she was there to cheer me on , encourage me and celebrate my successes as a writer and there to comfort me in times of doubt and disappointment she was supportive of my decision to return to graduate school in my forties to train as a psychotherapist something she had also done she accomplished so much in her professional life as a teacher , a principal and a savior of troubled schools after teaming with her dear friend and colleague , sister katherine jean , another 's era graduate , to literally save our high school when it faltered financially in the early 's , she was instrumental in turning it around , making it an academic powerhouse and the continuing success it is today after years of saving other schools on the brink of closing from affluent prep schools like flintridge to troubled , cash strapped inner city schools she moved north and spent the last decade of her life working happily in two positions at stanford university as a counselor for students and as a member of the human subjects committee , supporting research at stanford medical center to the end , she was happy , engaged , making a difference a joyous spirit , radiating love one of the greatest accolades i ever heard about sister ramona came from my fervently atheist husband bob asked at a social gathering to name the most successful person he had ever met , he answered immediately sister ramona ! she 's smart , successful at her work , and so compassionate , so kind , and really , really funny ! she is the finest human being i have ever known there is no one like her ! no one she 's irreplaceable inimitable incredibly precious to so many who had a good fortune to know her she was direct , sometimes blunt , tough when she needed to be but , more often , she would laugh when things were going well and even when they were n't she never lost perspective and had some interesting insights a few years ago , i was having dinner with her and we were discussing a classmate of mine whose childhood was troubled , but whose adult life has been even more difficult and sad when i think of your backgrounds , i think yours was so much worse , she said but then it hit me as crazy as your home life was , your parents really loved you every school play you were in , every parent teacher conference , they were there , so proud of you , loving you so much and i felt such gratitude for this wonderful gift of insight into my past so many years later blowing kisses at her jubilee may there were so many special gifts of love and grace , so many valuable lessons in living she taught me through the years when i heard of her passing , i was filled with gratitude that i was blessed to know this wonderful , one of a kind woman and i felt a rush of sudden regret that i did n't always follow her example of putting people first we never did get to enjoy that convent sleepover when fall came , i was busy working on a difficult update of the teenage body book slated for publication this summer sometime in the winter , perhaps , i said , making a plane reservation for late march , then canceling when it sounded like the timing was inconvenient for her i had no idea , until today , how inconvenient it was why did i think that , against all visual evidence , she would go on forever ? even in death , sister ramona continues to teach me valuable lessons
