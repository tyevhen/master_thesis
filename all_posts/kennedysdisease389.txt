as i mentioned in my dutasteride update , i upped my exercise routine to minutes every other day this last month guess what ? i was becoming bored i found myself not enjoying the exercise program as much as i have in the past i felt it was too long versus too much i also didn t feel i was gaining any real benefit from the longer routine yesterday i decided to back off a little less reps to determine if that would help i cut back all the upper body exercises by the exercise program was more pleasant and i did not feel like i was just going through the motions near the end it took minutes and afterward i felt like i enjoyed the exercise routine again it was also nice to have the extra minutes in the morning so , i ll try the shorter routine for this next month and not worry about it if i see the need to step it up , i will change to kda website on another subject , have you visited the kda website recently ? i added a what s new section whenever you visit the site , this page will summarize any recent changes by topic , date and subject the what s new link can be found under the banner and also on the left side menu check it out when you have a chance happy holidays
