i am continually amazed how recovery has improved my life although i still suffer with fearful temper , i now have the tools to handle and muddle through situations that at one time would have been paralyzing for example , i have a history of being a checker checking the locks , checking to make sure the stove is off , rereading documents multiple times , opening envelopes to make sure i really did put the letter inside i would repeat these and many other activities ad nauseam every day in recovery , however , i learned to let go of insecure thoughts and behaviors such as repetitive checking dr low taught me to be self led instead of symptom led perhaps most important of all , i have developed the courage to make mistakes when i learned about this recovery tool , i had an epiphany i have long been a perfectionist the idea that i could actually accept the fact that i will make errors and mistakes was so foreign to me yet doing so lifted a heavy burden from my shoulders , as it is not easy trying to be perfect ! it indeed takes courage to stop listening to all of the warnings in your brain that something is wrong i had to give up my passion for self distrust and actively challenge thoughts that previously kept me in an endless cycle of doubt and worry i had to accept that i should not strive to be a perfectionist i should strive to be average our society does not have a high view of average people but i d rather be mentally healthy and average than perfect and miserable of course , every now and then i find myself wanting to check something that s average usually my recovery tools help me fight the urge and move onto something else even if i have a moment of weakness i know that i should excuse , rather than accuse , myself all of these recovery tools have made daily living so much more enjoyable , an outcome i thought for a long time i could only achieve by being perfect
