pwt pain withdrawal threshold a lower number means greater sensitivity to mechanical pain carrageenan was used as the source of mechanical pain here in a , you see that duloxetine cymbalta restored pwt to normal in both normal mice wt and mice without serotonin brain cells lmxb , thus indicating a pain relieving effect however , in b at the bottom , fluoxetine prozac did not improve the pwt after injection of carrageenan focus on the black bars , indicating that prozac does not help this kind of pain in mice without serotonin , meaning that serotonin is an important part of pain regulation , but norepinephrine may be even more important okay , dinah , here 's something though it does n't really shake things up check out this article in the journal of neuroscience by zq zhao et al , showing pretty good evidence like we needed more that the brain neurotransmitter , serotonin or ht , is involved in pain regulation what they did was use knockout mice mice which have been genetically altered to remove or disable the gene which codes for a given protein which have had the codes for serotonin neurons in the brain removed so , these mice do not have serotonin producing brain cells this permits the researchers to see the effect that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris and other antidepressants have or do n't have on the mice they were interested in the anti pain also called nociceptive effects of these antidepressants , and the role that serotonin plays for example , we know that antidepressants which have both serotonin and norepinephrine ne effects snris , like cymbalta and effexor are better at reducing pain than those with solely serotonin effects ssris , like prozac and paxil so , these particular mice have normal pain responses to hot things , reduced pain responses to mechanical pain eg , pinch , squeeze , crush in this study , they simply poked them with different sizes of fishing line , and elevated pain responses to inflammation eg , an infection , arthritis , etc the acute analgesic properties of antidepressants were simply nonexistent in these mice their acute pain responses were unaffected by antidepressants however , snris did reduce their responses to chronic pain , while ssris did not although the noradrenergic system in lmxbf f p mice appears to be normal , the analgesic effect of the tca amitriptyline on acute thermal pain behavior was strongly attenuated in lmxbf f p mice because a total absence of analgesic effect was observed in lmxbf f p mice treated with fluoxetine and duloxetine , the residual analgesic effect observed in lmxbf f p mice treated with amitriptyline is likely caused by mechanisms other than blockade of ht and ne reuptake , such as channel modulation and nmda receptor antagonism lawson , wang et al , together , our data indicate that although the ne component seems to be critical in the analgesic effect of antidepressants , endogenous ht is also of fundamental importance for the analgesic effect of these drugs , especially in reducing thermal sensitivity they conclude that together , our data indicate that although the ne component seems to be critical in the analgesic effect of antidepressants , endogenous ht is also of fundamental importance for the analgesic effect of these drugs , especially in reducing thermal sensitivity the main reason i posted this is just to demonstrate the cool things one can do with genetics you can knock out a gene in this case , the one responsible for turning a developing neuron into a serotonin producing neuron you can then figure out what the consequences of that absent gene are finally , this also emphasizes how we can learn how to fine tune our knowledge about pain control , so that more effective and less addictive treatments can be developed
