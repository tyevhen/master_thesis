when drug companies provide kickbacks and bribes to physicians , they sometimes make the news for a brief spin around the news cycle , followed by shock when the same thing happens again a few news cycles later but the point of this post is not to describe the amnesia that has befallen the media , but to wonder why nobody calls out the recipients of such lucre to give credit where it is certainly due , health care renewal and some other blogs keep a close on such behavior but my take is that the occasional sense of outrage regarding bribes , kickbacks , and other goodies tends to be shoved nearly entirely in the direction of the drug medical device industry do n't get me wrong they deserve some serious blame and shame , but if physicians would n't take the enticements , then there would be no problem to begin with as the hackneyed phrase goes , it takes two to tango and these legal deals work out great merck or bristol myers squibb or whomever can simply settle the claims with the feds , pay out a sh tload of cash , but admit no wrongdoing and the doctors who were bribed we rarely know much about them they seem to get a free pass yet when we catch an occasional whiff of what these doctors are up to , it is quite telling to quote from my post in may which i humbly suggest that you should read in its entirety anya s doctor , george realmuto gave several educational marketing speeches for concerta , manufactured by johnson johnson , which also makes risperdal he had the following to say and i hope he was misquoted when asked about why he gives marketing speeches for drugs to the extent that a drug is useful , i want to be seen as a leader in my specialty and that i was involved in a scientific study , he said i e i wanna be a key opinion leader ? ? ? the money is nice , too , he said dr realmuto s university salary is , academics don t get paid very much , he said if i was an entertainer , i think i would certainly do a lot better hey , can someone fetch me the kleenex ? making , per year is a sign that he does not get paid very much cry me a river in blanking credible and i'm just referencing legalized bribery , the kind where docs take cash to become product spokespersons it would be quite tantalizing if we actually had a better idea of what , exactly , these bribes and kickbacks entailed yeah , we know that drug companies blatantly buy off some doctors in developing countries , providing cars , air conditioners , cameras and a wide variety of other products we also know that drug companies must be a bit more subtle in how they bribe doctors in the so called developed world sure , we have the vacations disguised as educational meetings , the speaking engagements , seeding trials , and the like dressing up bribery as a form of education and or research please feel free to add a few more tricks of the trade in the comments section i 've hit my limit for press releases which mention legal settlements and bribing doctors , yet fail to mention what bribing actually means
