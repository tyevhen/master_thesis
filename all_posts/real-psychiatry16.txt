any pubmed search on waiting list mortality will produce a long list of articles on mortality that occurs on transplantation waiting lists and all of the associated ethical and logistic problems i could not locate any work done on waiting lists to get in to see psychiatrists , primary care physicians , or specialists to an extent , waiting list mortality is expected and some of the risk factors increasing age , significant chronic medical illnesses , high risk medications is undoubtedly predictive but what about the person who calls in and describes a clear cut problem that is misclassified and the error is potentially life threatening i have picked up a few of these problems in psychiatric clinics where the ultimate emergency diagnosis was unrelated to the reason for the appointment seeing a patient who is white as a ghost , complaining of coffee ground emesis , and determining the hemoglobin to be is one of many examples anxiety was the reason for that appointment i have found a number of acutely anemic patients due to blood loss with complaints about anxiety , shortness of breath , and panic attacks who really needed blood transfusions i have a more concrete recent example that is much more common in psychiatric practice , especially if a significant number of patients with alcohol and benzodiazepine problems are being seen that is the problem of nocturnal anxiety with panic attacks to make it a little more interesting , let 's say our hypothetical patient is years old , has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation brief episodes , does not take an anticoagulant , and takes flecainide to prevent atrial fibrillation and metroprolol to prevent palpitations he has obstructive sleep apnea and is on apap his ahi is or less on any given night he has never has an electrophysiological study stress test and echocardiogram were both negative he has had to taper the metoprolol over a period of about years from mg bid to mg daily due to lower and lower bp suddenly the patient is noticing palpitations at night they seem to occur at the end of rem type dreams and do not seem to correlate with the emotional content of the dream the awakenings with palpitations typically occur at am he has not had a panic attacks in years he does not drink or use benzodiazepines to terminate the palpitations he gets up and drinks a large glass of water or walks around and they resolve in about seconds he gets a small single lead ecg device that reads one aberrant beat as occasional pvc he gets in to see his primary care md in a couple of days his exam is normal and he is in sinus rhythm no aberrant heart beats are noted by his internist electrolytes and magnesium level are normal he goes home that night and the palpitations continue he calls his sleep medicine physicians who tells him to start with his cardiologist he calls the cardiologist who concludes that these are beats that originate in the lower chambers of the heart and there is nothing to be concerned about despite the acute change in symptoms that is waking him up on a nightly basis no further testing , examination or diagnosis is offered frustrated he calls a referral center and schedules a sleep study in about months is there something else that could have happened in this case ? if you happen to be this man 's psychiatrist like i am in many of these cases of sleep related symptoms what is the differential diagnosis and what else can be done a reasonable differential diagnosis of these palpitations might consider the following list of conditions night time palpitations differential diagnosis sleep terrors nightmares nocturnal panic attacks alcohol or sedative hypnotic withdrawal stimulant or hallucinogen intoxication cardiac arrhythmia tachyarrhythmias ventricular arrhythmias supraventricular arrhythmias conduction delay arrhythmias in considering the list there are some useful clinical features sleep terrors are rare in adults they typically occur in the first half of the night the patient suddenly arouses from sleep they may scream they have intense sympathetic output including diaphoresis , flushing , tachycardia , tachypnea , and mydriasis they may appear to be disoriented nightmares are typically dreams with negative emotional content that occur with awakening from non rem sleep sympathetic arousal is not as prominent nocturnal panic attacks np can occur in people with daytime panic attacks dp or as a separate entity people with combined dp np had more symptom severity palpitations are a feature of panic attacks in a recent study the authors also rule out associated disorders like substance use problems and obstructive sleep apnea by exclusion and testing the pure np group were predominately male , had a childhood history of sleep terrors , and were more likely to have respiratory symptoms choking sensations despite a lower overall symptom severity score than the dp np group suggesting a more common mechanism with night terrors because of the similarity between nocturnal panic attacks , sleep terrors , dream anxiety attacks and nocturnal seizures some authors encourage extreme caution in making the diagnosis the alcohol and substance intoxication and withdrawal states may be less obvious outside of treatment setting specializing in these disorders patients with these problems may not disclose the full extent of use in the proper context , discontinuation of both cannabis and hallucinogens like lsd occurs due to increasing anxiety and panic attacks alcohol and sedative hypnotic withdrawal can cause prominent sympathetic symptoms including night sweats , tachycardia , and panic attacks those symptoms typically resolve with treatment of the underlying withdrawal syndrome in some cases the anxiety and panic attacks persist and require additional treatment pure cardiac symptoms associated with sleep can be confusing the patient is aroused and may notice the arrhythmia the question becomes is the arrhythmia secondary to anxiety and sympathetic arousal or is the anxiety secondary to the chest sensation ? in the case of a patient with known sleep apnea and atrial fibrillation here are several possible causes including breakthrough atrial fibrillation at the time of the awakening in this case there was a crude monopolar tracing that showed a ventricular premature beat vpb vpbs are commonly associated with anxiety , but is it enough to count on the patient capturing the event by getting up out of bed and holding an inexpensive device to his chest ? patient with sleep disordered breathing are at increased risk from nocturnal death midnight to am and one of the mechanisms may be arrhythmia from the cardiac effects of sleep disordered breathing the patient in this case is very much alive and functioning at a high level he still has the nocturnal palpitations but is less anxious about them because they are now intermittent and always seem to resolve in a short period of time if he thinks about it for nay length of time the question that comes up is why now ? he hopes that the referral center will have the answer to that question i do n't have any outcome or ready solutions to this problem in many ways it highlights a potential quality problem in the high tech american healthcare system here we have a patient who is fairly compulsive about his own health care he has a primary care physician who he saw and contacted both his specialists when there was no answer , he contacted a referral center and set up an appointment months out into the future what will happen while he is on that waiting list is a probability statement with a series of unknown probabilities what is disappointing from my perspective as a physician trained in the s is that at some point the rigorous intellectual approach to patients problems has fallen by the wayside in favor of rationing we are no longer in pursuit of a diagnosis that might make a difference we are satisfied with saying i checked off all of the boxes and i did n't see anything it 's a st century variation of the old joke the operation was a success but unfortunately the patient died i am very interested in what the cost of this approach is in terms of human life and additional comorbidity i think that what happens to people on these waiting lists compared to controls is where the emphasis should be place and not on how fast patients should be discharged and not readmitted to hospitals despite all of the press about unnecessary tests and the risks associated with those tests , the commonest errors i see that result in patient injury is missing the obvious diagnosis and not doing the appropriate tests there is something wrong with a health care system when a psychiatrist cares more about these problems than the physicians running the system george dawson , md , dfapa references selim bj , koo bb , qin l , et al the association between nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias and sleep disordered breathing the dream study journal of clinical sleep medicine jcsm official publication of the american academy of sleep medicine doi jcsm nakamura m , sugiura t , nishida s , komada y , inoue y is nocturnal panic adistinct disease category ?
