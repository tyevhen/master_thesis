i ve had a rough few weeks something i ve probably mentioned before is that it is very hard for me to blog about my mental state when it s at its lowest thus this blog has never served the purpose that i hoped it would when i first set it up but it does have some value to me and , quite surprisingly , to others so i keep it up a few truths about this blog have developed recently i m sharing these because since my last entry a few weeks ago some readers have communicated to me their dissatisfaction with the sporadic nature of this project knowing how i write this thing might help these readers understand why i dip in an out of it as i do i never read old entries i don t like reading what i ve written here this is unusual typically i read and reread what i ve written endlessly , especially editable web content but i learned early on that if i look back on this blog then i just want to delete it all i m glad i had the foresight to do this anonymously or there s no way i d let some most of the whining that i ve done here stand i don t always blog when i want to there have been a number of times over the last few weeks when i really did want to sit down and pour out an entry but i didn t mainly because my proper writing career is becoming busier all of the time and for most of the past few weeks i was dealing with looming deadlines right now my nearest deadline is two months out my latest deadline was yesterday and i just made that one so , i couldn t spend my writing energy here think i m depressed now ? check with me when the electric company has cut power because i stopped paying the bill ! i only blog when i want to i tried to establish a regimented schedule for this blog as i do with my professional blogs but that just didn t work any value that this project has evaporates when i try to put it on a schedule oh , and one more thing as evidenced by my previous entry i will from time to time be posting sponsored entries i will maintain the honest , confessional voice that i ve established here but the topics might seem a bit strange please just bear with me on these can t fault me for making a buck , right ? between us , you ll always know that they are sponsored by the last line of the entry , ok ? ok , back to the last few weeks as i mentioned above i ve had a lot of deadlines this means more work and that s a good thing but it also means that a lot of different people have been depending on me for lots of different things i learned that this can be a source of anxiety it makes sense if i get anxious in social situations then it seems natural that i d get pretty anxious when others in my society are counting on me for something another source of stress is the fact that with each advancement i make in my career i find myself with a whole new audience to disappoint it never occurs to me when i m trying to get that next great gig but when i do i always tell myself that here s another first impression for me to totally screw up and the cycle starts i get anxious and nervous , i start to feel stress because i just know that this time i won t be able to pull it off , nervousness turns to self loathing which turns into a full on fit of depression then i spend a day or two curled up in bed or , more likely , drunk then i roust myself , develop a plan and execute it usually just in time for the deadline now , imagine going through that over and over with overlapping deadlines and you ll have an idea of how i spent july and the first week of august i refused a new job offer last week for obvious reasons oh , and regarding the st john s wort as you know i ve been trying to find a brand that i like here in the us herbals aren t regulated so i never know if i m getting the same thing from brand to brand i tried a few different ones and found that i preferred nature made i d bought a new bottle back in june but it just didn t seem to be doing the job this time around around mid july i crashed really hard as i was slogging through my emotional fog it suddenly occurred to me that i might be taking the wrong dose i checked the bottle and sure enough it said two pills three times a day my previous bottle a different brand had been one times three and it just didn t occur to me to check when i switched back things improved noticeably after that one more thing before i close this behemoth of an entry suicide returned during the darkest days of july i hadn t even noticed that it had left but it had and i can now say sjw really works for months i hadn t thought about suicide and it was lovely , looking back but now its back and it s probably going to take me a while to shake it but now i know that i can until next time , yours , ray
