i am finally back , after a long long time first my pc went wrong and then i cancelled my broad band and then i got my pc back but could not get online i have just finished installing all the new software and i now have both the broad band and the pc at the same time ! ! ! ! getting my new phone line and broadband service installed this morning led to my first panic attack for ages as i shut my finger in the front door while seeing the engineer out ! the thing is i felt the door closing and i was trying to hide my pain as i saw the guy out by the time he had gone which was only a second but felt like an hour my nail got a big black patch of trapped blood i don not know whether it is more concerning that my instinct is stronger to avoid embarisment than injury or whether i had a panic attack o i'm ok again now though although my finger is very sore ! !
