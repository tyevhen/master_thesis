i love this blog , love writing about unschooling and radical education , and plan to continue writing here for the foreseeable future hopefully with more frequency than i 've been posting lately ! but at some point , this blog has morphed from being a blog where i can write about anything , to a blog very specifically focused on education and directly related things like respectful parenting that is n't a bad thing at all i feel the focus and content of this blog is strong , and i like that but it has left me feeling a bit like i'm just sticking in my comfort zone in writing almost exclusively about unschooling , and has made me feel a bit restless i want to be writing about more different things , exploring in writing my views and experiences when it comes to other important subjects so i was absolutely thrilled when i asked my sister emilie if she would be interested in co authoring a new feminist blog with me , and she said yes ! that was a few weeks ago , and since then , we 've come up with a name let me give a shout out to ryan , follower of this blog , for suggesting the title ! , set up a blog , and are working on that in preparation for a launch in early december if you 'd like to stay up tp date on it 's progress , read interesting linked articles , and know right away when the blog goes live , you can follow it 's facebook page do n't worry if you do n't have facebook , you wo n't get all the updates , but i will post on this blog letting you know when sistermatic response is active ! just saying it 's a feminist blog may not really tell you if it 's something you 'd be interested in or not though it might , so here 's a bit more info our tagline is two feminist sisters on sexuality , gender , pop culture , and resistance , and part of the about page reads sistermatic response came about when two sisters , sisters who spent many hours swinging on swings and staying up into the wee hours of the morning , realized that all the things they regularly discuss such as sexism and gender oppression sexuality gender identity gender roles and expectations racism , heterosexism , cissexism , classism , and how those all tie into each other and tie into sexism the problematic and positive themes and tropes they regularly saw in their favourite and least favourite tv shows , novels , movies and comic books and the dismantling of and resistance to the various and complex systems of oppression that make up this culture could be written about , too , and shared with others and so this blog idea was born , as a place for us to publicly discuss , dissect , and rant about the world we live in and the things we experience on a daily basis all issues and movements and subjects overlap and interweave , and i'm sure there will be occasional cross posting of posts on i'm unschooled yes i can write and sistermatic response , but largely , this blog is my education blog , and sistermatic response will be my shared with my sister and best friend social justice and political blog i hope at least some of you share at least some of my excitement about this project ! if you do , come join us on facebook , and look for news on this blog about sr 's launch in december you might also like insecurities and an anniversary three years blogging and writing from the heart emi 's new blog , and changes to this blog ! debating and discussing happy st birthday to this blog ! linkwithin
