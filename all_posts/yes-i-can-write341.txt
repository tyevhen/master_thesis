my first video , that started the whole thing , is here the post about the first part of our discussion , along with the four videos we made going back and forth between our opinions is here annnd , he made several more response videos , the first of which i responded to in written format we 've both agreed to end the back and forth videos things , because it was taking a lot of time i believe the current amount of video time , including my original video , is around minutes yikes ! i'm not sure whether the discussion will continue in written form , so for now i 'll simply post his one video that i responded to , and just give you a link to his channel if you with to see his other videos hunter 's channel my response yup , i know about percentage of brain use i think you might be a bit low i thought it was around but other than that , yeah i agree , your brain can be tricked but , and this s important we as humans have nothing but our brains to rely on for information yup , i have a strong interest in education , and i'm aware of the main learning styles as well here 's what you 're missing people , if let too , will learn what style suits them best not because they 've done research , but because they are living and learning you do n't need to know the names for different learning styles to know what you enjoy doing most , and what things you retain the most information from yup , i think we 're going to have to agree to disagree on that point , because nothing will convince me that people are not born with an innate desire to learn and , if you do your research , youll see that that is true we , as a species , would die out if we did not learn learning is innate , absolutely and completely okay , what you 're saying is way back in history what i'm saying , is pre history , as in pre civilization , as in tribal peoples and you 've just hit one of my biggest pet peeves did n't have the desire to be anything more than they were ? ? what does that mean ? they were human were they supposed to desire to be more than human ? different than human ? what our culture does is say that we are the pinnacle of existence we , in this culture , in this day and age , are what everything was moving towards from the first bit of slime that crawled out of the ocean , everything , all of creation , was simply to produce us , modern civilized humans you could call it manifest destiny , i suppose , as so many high ranking murderers have in the past and look at us ! the single species that regards our lives , human lives , to be above all else , that have destroyed vast parts of the world , made whole places uninhabitable look at us what a great job we 've done , as we sit waiting for it all to come tumbling down around our ears and that 's not even to mention how god damned happy we all are monumental rates of depression , high suicide rates , drug addiction , messed up families wherever you turn and that 's not to mention how it 's only a tiny percentage of the overall human population that is not living in poverty , dying young from disease and famine and drought and war yet you have the guts to say that the people who came before , and still survive unharmed in a couple of tiny pockets , the rest having been annihilated , shut away on reserves , or assimilated , and you say that they never tried to be more than what they were they stopped when they reached a certain plateau of happiness what the fuck is wrong with being happy , and deciding to stay like that , happy , instead of destroying the environment surrounding you , the environment that sustains you , for some imaginary future world , future gain , future i have no fucking clue what ? really , none of us in this culture have any right to look down upon the people in our species who knew , and know , how to live in equilibrium with the world you have a strange view of happiness , although i get what you 're saying , but you 're mistaken about tribal peoples , once again as you may have noticed , that 's one of my main passions from anthropological research , tribal peoples had the most egalitarian societies of any culture in our species' history they had the most leisure time of any culture , ever , spending only about hours of work a day the exact time for different tribes and different parts of the world vary , and anthropologists argue over what constitutes work , but everyone seems to agree that it was somewhere between and hours a day the rest was complete leisure time , spent socializing , playing games , and similar things they lived and live in small bands tribes , so it 's a real community , and a real support network also , anthropologists studying the san ! kung people of the sahara desert found that they 're happier on a whole than civilized folk , regularly laughing with abandon , joking around , smiling their children are not expected to do any work until they 're in their late teens or early twenties people over fifty are not expected to work , either , and in one of the harshest climates in the world , excluding infant mortality , they can be expected to live , on average , to nearly years of age wow , that was a major rant sorry about that ! like i said , its a subject close to my heart lol why should people have anything other than happiness ? honestly , life is short i do n't see any point to life but happiness ! why go further than you want to go ? i honestly do n't understand that at all if you 're happy , and love life , that 's all anyone could ask for if you 're not happy , then you make changes in your life until you are people should be pushed to do better ? depends on your definition of better it sounds to me like you feel that you need to prove something to the world , and not simply that you want to be happy in life so every time you 're happy , you have to leave that happy place ? and what 's contributing to society , in your books ? most people , and i do mean most , want to do good doing good things i'm defining good as things that preserve or enhance quality of life for either human or other animals , or increases the happiness health wellbeing of others makes people happy helping fellow humans or fellow creatures makes people happy just being generally good makes most people happy ! i mean , i look at what i want to do in life i want to learn a ton about herbal healing , natural health and wellness , and be able to help people learn how to take care of themselves i want to be a strong advocate of unschooling , and help and support families and students who decide to leave the school system i also want to be a part of a green community , to held build truly sustainable communities all of these things are deep passions of mine , things that i see as being helpful to others , while also being things i truly care about and enjoy doing welfare works differently here as does the whole health care system public health care and , do you think its right that , where you live , the government controls people to such an extent ? i certainly do n't i originally sent this to hunter unproofread , so i fixed it up a bit here for clarity and reading pleasure peace , idzie
