once more , it 's saturday morning and i find myself catching up on really important reading , stuff i 've been caching all week in hopes of getting back to real soon now at the top of the list ? this excellent post by ron patrick describing his jet powered vw beetle , which was featured on the david letterman show above on september , patrick 's web page has lots of photos and goes into detail about the design , motivations , and installation details behind the use of a general electric t turboshaft engine meant for navy helicopters in a street legal beetle the engine in question develops horsepower in its original helicopter application , but note that that 's in a turboshaft configuration patrick is using it as a free turbine jet thrust only , no mechanical drive if he were to couple it mechanically to the drive train of the beetle , the torque would probably pretzel the car 's chassis faster than you could say holy halon , batman , where 's the fire extinguisher ? is this a great country , or what ?
