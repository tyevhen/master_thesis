today at bigthink and here i'm blogging about prostate cancer , which is the second leading cause of cancer death in american men in particular , i want to get the word out about selenium 's well documented ability to protect again prostate carcinomas it turns out there are other important health benefits for people of both sexes to selenium , some of which i summarize in my bigthink post while selenium 's exact mode of action is still not wholly known , it appears the mineral induces apoptosis of cancer cells by triggering caspase a cysteine aspartate protease involved in the execution phase of programmed cell death apoptosis after writing the bigthink post , i decided to have a little fun and try for some do it yourself epidemiology graphs i was startled by the results this is what i came up with prostate cancer in the u s , obtained from http ratecalc cancer gov ratecalc the above map shows u s prostate cancer by county rates are population adjusted so you 're not seeing mere population density effects it 's obvious that the cancer rate is not randomly distributed by geography but what , i wondered , could account for the uneven distribution ? i searched online for a map of soil selenium distribution , and this is what i found at http tin er usgs gov geochem doc averages se usa gif obviously the inverse correlation between selenium and prostate cancer is not perfect how could it be ? americans are a mobile lot and people do n't simply eat locally grown vegetables , etc but i think the two maps speak pretty clearly to the role of selenium in protecting against prostate cancer if you want to draw a different conclusion , so be it
