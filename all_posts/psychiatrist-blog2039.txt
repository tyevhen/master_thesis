posted by dinah it started back on out of the office when thetundrapa commented that she did n't socialize with her depressed patients too needy and i suppose they are n't good company this did n't sit so well with neonursechic who responded , just made me feel like because i have depression , then nobody wants to be friends with me sarebear , too , feels her mental illness interferes with her ability to make friends please forgive me if i misinterpreted anyone , and hey , that 's what the comment section is for then we move along to the posts on whining , and my esteemed co blogger roy confesses that his wife thinks he has add because he leaves household projects unfinished , he denies the diagnosis , and like a good friend , i pipe in with the unsolicited opinion , based on nearly a decade of observation in a variety of settings , but no formal psychiatric evaluation , that roy does not have add , that his office is a mess because he is a slob off blog , he told me he 'd rather have add than be a slob , and back on blog , he 's now commenting about whether slob will be in dsm and can it be labeled messiness , nos so , who wants a diagnosis and what does it mean ? for roy , i'm left perplexed that he would want a psychiatric diagnosis , a damaged brain that would impair his ability to function he wants to opt out of responsibility for his behavior , be able to drop those dirty sock anywhere and have an excuse if a diagnosis does n't exist , damn it , he 'll make one might i suggest that as long as i do n't have to live with roy , that it 's fine if he 's a slob ? a certain degree of neatness is expected in the little box , and if one chooses to be sloppy , perhaps that 's fine he 's rationalized it all away too busy to be bothered , so why does he need a now socially sanctioned diagnosis to relieve him of responsibility for a behavior he admits he 's chosen ? it is estimated that over of people suffer from a psychiatric disorder in any given year , the lifetime prevalence is much higher if thetundrapa is able to avoid friendships with people with depression , or any other mental illness , my best guess is that this may be a function of under diagnosis and treatment out there on the alaskan tundra , it seems to me that all one has to do to find people with mental illnesses is to look or to mention at a party that you 're a psychiatrist while people with axis i diagnoses may have periods where they are less interested in friendships or less available to participate in friendships , the mere existence of a psychiatric diagnosis does n't chase people away in fact , when people advertise their diagnosis they often serve as magnets for others who are suffering from the same problems and are thrilled to find someone who understands i 'll requote shiny happy person see the whining post for her link having a mental illness deprives you of the right to be a weirdo i 'll add to that magnificent thought perhaps having a mental illness deprives you of the right to be a slob , or to be an unlikeable person , but i do n't think so
