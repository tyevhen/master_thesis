after recently watching davina mccall 's sports relief challenge , i was inspired after only three months training , she managed to swim , walk and cycle for miles in seven days even after finishing the challenge she could n't believe how she 'd managed to do it throughout the week she endured a lot of pain and tears , but still managed to continue the program had got me thinking someone who 's not a professional athlete and who has only trained for three months , managed to complete something so massive it seems almost incomprehensible that 's because it seems unlikely that the body could be put through so much however , this where the mind comes in i could n't believe that davina was doing so much her mental ability surprised me it showed me and many other people that if you put your mind to something , you can accomplish many things her positive mindset overcame the pain she was going through you can apply this to any situation in your life to a sports competition , eating healthily , and even to your education if you really focus on a goal and the thing you want to do , you will get there there will be obstacles in the way and setbacks , but if you try hard enough and build up your mindset , you can accomplish go for it ! do n't forget , you can still donate to sport relief best wishes , amy xx
