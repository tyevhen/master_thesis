i 've been back from my american adventure three weeks in fact , three weeks ago , this very second , i was flying somewhere over the atlantic ocean enjoying a delta airlines breakfast with a cuppa tea in a plastic cup that sure beats the monday morning train from bedford to london st pancreas needless to say , i had a fantastic time away i kept a travel journal by the way , which i intend to write up that trip was meant to be a taster for me , or even a tester a test of my traveling ability , my courage to explore new places and my anxiety of uncertainty i feel like i passed my self set exam with top marks the biggest revelation i had on my trip because i always have a holiday revelation , whether it 's a week in devon or two weeks road tripping america was that it 's really really good to push yourself to do things outside your comfort zone of course i knew this already but those few weeks have opened my eyes to the travelling possibilities this world and virgin atlantic have to offer it feels amazing since i 've been back i 've been spending any spare few minutes searching the internet for cheap flights or around the world tickets or glued to google maps i think it 's fair to say i have caught the travelling bug trouble is , my new found freedom and sense of adventure does n't sit very well alongside a sort of high powered career in london you ca n't really be focused on forging out a super successful career in fashion when you 're seriously considering a four month stint working in some aussie bar my motivation at work , already lacking before my trip , has now nearly altogether dissapeared since i 've been back it 's been even harder to focus it feels like my priorities have all shifted wrongly or rightly , it was n't so long ago that work , a career and embarrassingly money was all important to me now i just want to enjoy everyday day , enjoy my job , be care free and make the most of everything sitting for hours a day on a train , then another hours at a desk does n't really sit well with my new outlook it 's actually weighing me down monday to friday seems a bit like a waste of time when i'm feeling like that i have to make the effort to check myself i make sure to list everything i'm thankful for and having a job in the first place is a good start so please excuse me for sounding like an ungrateful bitch with a seemingly cool job in london it 's not ungratefulness at all , i know i'm extremely lucky to have everything i do right now it 's just i know i need a change , i know i need to re asses my work life thing , i need to make some decisions and take some action but i'm being a wuss about it i'm worried about making a career changing decision when ultimately i 've been focused on work for the last eight years it 's a big thing , it 's a big decision what 's ironic is i know what i should do , i learnt it from my trip , i need to push myself to do the scary thing i need to change my job just like that monday night back in march when i took out my credit card and booked my flights to la , i just need to take the plunge and take some action , after all what 's the worst that can happen ? i change my job , be even more bored so decide to book a flight and enjoy some sunshine that sounds pretty awful to me not
