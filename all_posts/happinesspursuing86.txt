something unexpected has happened with this little blog it has a readership now of course this was the ultimate intention it is a blog , after all i just didn t expect it to happen so very soon blogging about my depression was really the natural choice for me i ve tried writing personal journals about the problem but they invariably turned into ponderous , unreadable and ultimately unwritable examinations of the minutiae of my emotional life nobody understands me manifestos blogging and the possibility that others would find and read it , awareness of a potential audience , kept that from happening the possible pitfall of a blog is to swing too far towards pleasing the reader the same impulse that drives me to answer fine whenever asked how i am has the danger of making this exercise vapidly meaningless but back to my small audience i ve been submitting my entries to social indexing sites like technorati and digg so my blog wouldn t be allowed to retreat into comfortable , naval gazing anonymity and i knew that doing so would eventually lead to a readership i just didn t expect it to happen quite so quickly and in referring to my readership don t think that i m getting swept up in anything here i maintain quite a few blogs whose readerships range from two or three a day to ten thousand a day the point about this audience is that it is huge in my mind when i write even though i ve taken steps to remove the safety net , the fact of a real readership that exists now instead of in the hypothetical future substantially changes the way that i think about this project and , more importantly , how and what i write about take this entry , for example so , where do i go from here ? initially i d planned on a mixture of entries that more or less chronicled depressive events from life , sort of a portrait of the depressed blogger as a young man , and entries about my current attempts at self help therapies this would have all been foundation building not that my eventual readers would have cared i really wouldn t have expected them to find my blog six months in and go back to read all of the previous entries but i would have had the foundation making blogging about my ongoing portrait of a middle aged man easier to maintain but the fact of the sudden readership makes me reconsider this plan this isn t a intellectual decision it really happens at a gut level when i sit down to write or even think about writing this current audience as already standing over my shoulder who really wants , i ask myself , to read about what would have been a non event to anyone else in eighth grade algebra but turned into a festering thorn that took me fifteen years to come to terms with ? as much as i d like to be selfish and can theoretically defend selfishness in this case , now that i have readers with personalities everything s changed plus the huge amount about depression and the wide variety of therapies available light therapy ? really ? is staggering so many seem to hold promise making it difficult to decide where to start dwelling on the past seems like a waste of time when there s so much to deal with in the present what this hell is this entry about anyway ? well , i really can t say except that i intended it to help me work out the new dynamic of the audience an audience for which i m incredibly grateful , in case that wasn t clear i m really not sure if i ve done that
