home inspection has been available as an e book on amazon for days now , and it 's been available as a free download for days , and will be available for free until wednesday at pm eastern time midnight , pacific time it 's sold a few hundred copies to date so far , reviews on amazon with the full range , , , stars bsw says it 's a great read sacco says it 's fiction for low brows it 's not enough to insult the author , ya get the reader , too fluff at the nd grade level a second amazon reviewer also called it fluff , but noted they 'd seen worse writing rob and tigermom have both emailed me saying they like it i 'll omit any details beyond this because they were private emails sarebear enjoyed it and had mixed feelings about reading the therapist 's perspective on therapy is that a fair summary and was kind enough to point out some typos to me that i fixed meg , with her doctorate from harvard , stopped after chapters to put an endorsement up on her facebook page a says the sample chapter of my other novel was annoying with bad grammar , spelling errors , no plot , and unsophisticated writing , so this book must be the same a critic found the beginning stiff , compares it to in treatment , but is now enjoying anonymous , also a publisher , is hooked and says it 's well written , happy to have it free a couple of people have mentioned that the psychiatrist has too many problems , and people seem to have feeling about his sexual issues so you know , i wrote this novel about years ago , well before the in treatment series an agent represented it , but could n't sell it to a major publisher i tried small publishers , and one asked to meet with me to tell me what was wrong with it he suggested it would read better if the story was told in first person , and so i re wrote it , changed the names of the patients , and retitled it patient pursuits and began another round of looking for agents at some point , i surrendered , wrote another novel and that was so bad , even i could n't stand to read it somewhere in there , i wrote a children 's book , mitch and wendy lost in adventure land , and then double billing which i hoped would have more commercial appeal i forgot about home inspection , and then remembered it i thought this would be a good time to pitch it because of it 's similarity to in treatment how i watched seasons of in treatment and did n't think hey , i wrote a book with this format , i 'll never know roy convinced me to give amazon 's publishing a try , and so i'm starting with this novel , but the other two will go up soon , hopefully later this summer is it good ? is it fluff for second graders ? you be the judge i think what 's unique about it is that it 's a psychiatrist 's view of psychotherapy , and while it 's not all completely on target because it is fiction , the give and take , and how the shrink 's thoughts wander , do have a realistic feel chat here , if you 'd like , but please also put your reviews on amazon and i 'd be very appreciative if you 'd tweet , blog , and link it on facebook so others can find the free promotion
