this is it in less than a week i will be at university it 's weird to think of because of my poor attendance throughout my a levels making university seem impossible nevertheless , i am going and it just shows that you can still live your life even with anxiety i have to admit , it 's like waking up from a nightmare i 've finally woken up after all of these years and i'm about to start a new chapter it 's been years of battling with my mental health and finally i have made it and i ca n't quite believe it thinking back now , it 's like having all of my memories flash before my eyes all of those days anxiety drained my hope and life , and then the rare light that picked me back up again i can remember it all as if it were yesterday and it 's the strangest feeling i know that i 've not recovered from my anxiety yet , but i am a whole world away from where i was before i'm sure that university will be a challenge even without anxiety troubles , but will also be the making of me not only is it weird to think i am moving out soon , because i never thought i 'd see the day but , because i have been quite complacent i guess i just do n't feel old enough yet supposedly you never feel old enough anyway , you just learn how to deal with things no one really knows what they 're doing ! not only that , but i have to leave my friends and family behind i know it 's not forever , but i wo n't see them as often i do n't want that to come any quicker than needs be i 'd much rather go now than experience the hell which was my anxiety at school for another year i 'll never forget the people who 've made this possible for me and who 've kept me going during the darkest of times i appreciate it more than words can say i guess it 's time to start packing ! it 's time to move on and begin another journey let 's hope it 's more of a dream than a nightmare this time ! you can do it ! amy xx i wo n't be able to post much over these next few weeks whilst i get used to the move to university i hope you understand !
