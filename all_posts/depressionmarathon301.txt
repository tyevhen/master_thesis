i must confess i feel bad i feel like i need to apologize to my regular readers i'm sorry i have n't been writing here as frequently as usual things have been going so well lately , i feel like i have little to say i do n't think another report about my past few days is all that interesting that being said , i'm somewhat grateful i have little to say things have been pretty simple and straight forward lately there is no drama , and i'm so , so thankful for that work is going well , running is running , and jet still makes me laugh out loud every day what else is there to say ? so i apologize i do n't have much to say day by day , my life is moving forward i 've been putting one foot in front of the other , meeting my responsibilities , tapering for grandmas marathon , loving jet , getting out with friends once in awhile , and taking care of my physical and mental being it may sound boring , but sometimes boring is good
