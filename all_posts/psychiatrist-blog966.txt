i'm reading a book where the shrinky author starts off with a revelation it 's not the best care to see patients for a minute evaluation , start a medication , have them come back in a month for a minute med check , and refer them to a social worker for psychotherapy it does sound like a good way to make a lot of money if you are n't totally exhausted , overwhelmed with the phone calls and paperwork you must have seeing that huge a case load , and are someone who is gratified from this type of work , then it 's cool by me it 's not what i want to do the author trained at about the same time as i did , and trained at an institution with a biological orientation , like the one i trained out he talks about this kind of care as though it 's standard and the usual and expected i 've never heard this as standard , and in my private practice , i see new patients for hours , and want people to come back weekly for minute sessions until they are no longer symptomatic , or they 've gotten what they want out of the treatment some people come into treatment without symptom their old shrink moved or died , and they just want a script and someone to rely on if they get sick i do n't insist they come every week , but i 'll ask them to come more frequently than they are used to coming for a little while until i feel like i know them some people ca n't afford weekly psychotherapy or find it to be a burden , and i often respect their wishes to come less frequently , unless their illness is destroying their ability to function , in which case i think they need to come weekly i do n't see anyone more than once a week unless there is an emergency routinely , and i never seem to have patients who come requesting twice weekly therapy sessions almost everyone comes for the full minute session a few people who just are n't talkers come for half hour sessions i 've worked in a number of community mental health centers i know some clinics have huge caseloads and a full time doc may have patients i 've never worked anywhere like this most of the clinics i 've worked in have left the frequency of visits up to the doc , though certainly there is a clinic tone in one clinic i worked in , most patients saw the doc once a month , where i work now , it 's once every three months for patients who are stable the therapist attends those sessions , and they may be quite brief many of the patients do n't seem to want to talk , and the paperwork burden imposed by the regulatory agencies are very heavy still , the standard at all the clinics i 've worked in is patients an hour the no show rate is high , and sometimes a rd patient may be squeezed into the schedule if there is a scheduling problem my record is patients in one day , and this was while i was volunteering at a clinic in louisiana after katrina , and the clinic had no full time doctors and a huge demand it was patients i 'd never seen before , some were quite troubled , and it was a tiring day for me so my hat goes off to those docs who see patients an hour i could n't do it so what is the standard ? i thought i 'd ask of our readers , it looks like many see their psychiatrists weekly and many see them for minute sessions just thought i 'd ask thank you for taking my surveys and please do add your comments
