life is moving forward for everyone , it seems , but me i am stuck in a holding pattern i 've been able to do little over the past several days my mood remains quite low , and my thoughts quite dark i 've been in constant contact with either my sponsor , my social worker , my psychologist or my doctor they 've each lent a hand i 've talked with my sponsor almost daily , and we 've gone to a couple of aa meetings together my doctor adjusted my meds that seems to have helped the thinking just a bit my social worker came and sat with me on a particularly dark and scary afternoon that was helpful and my psychologist has reassured me more than once over the phone but mostly , i 've spent my time curled up and covered up on my sofa with puck lying at my feet i 've got friends offering to take me into their homes i have n't gone , not out of stubbornness or self pity , but because i 'd have to put on that slight smile and be minimally sociable , even though they know i feel like crap that prospect is overwhelming , so i 've stayed at home at least here i can just be i am in familiar surroundings with no expectations that 's about all i can handle for now i ca n't cook i ca n't clean i do n't want to talk on the phone i can barely shower sleep , right now , seems my only respite i'm holding on that 's all i can do i'm working with the people with whom i need to work i'm grateful to have trustworthy people who are willing to work with me , too together , we will get through i know that but for now , i'm just holding on
