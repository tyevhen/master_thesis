so how common is social phobia ? some varying answers is it at any one point in time and over a person s lifetime ? is it at any one point in time and over a person s lifetime ? is it at any one point in time and over a person s lifetime ? these estimates are all derived from peer reviewed epidemiological studies on the topic and it is clear that they vary greatly let s think about social anxiety for a moment social phobia social anxiety disorder appeared on the mental health scene with a vengeance about a decade ago thanks in large part to a wonderful educational campaign by cohn wolfe , a pr firm hired by smithklinebeecham to spread the word about this allegedly underrecognized and undertreated condition that was devastating the lives of untold tens of millions across the globe , , the lifetime prevalence figure is oft cited , but it is important to consider that credible evidence has also placed the figure as low as about yes , i am aware that the figure is from the u s and the figure is from italy but does anyone want to argue that italian and american cultures are so different that social anxiety in these cultures would really differ by a factor of six ? perhaps someone with more energy can look through these papers as well as the many other similar epidemiological studies that have been conducted and take a stab at why the estimates vary so greatly might it have something to do with where we set the cutoff ? might it be that the more we label mere shyness as pathology , the higher our rates of social anxiety disorder ? seems that we might want to consider whether a disorder actually causes significant impairment before we call it a disorder , eh ? social phobia is often listed as the third most common mental disorder , , but it seems we had better start asking more questions and show more skepticism before blindly accepting that this condition is running rampant
