today , i received a veritable jewel of a book in the mail , entitled reasons why i'm an unschooler by ps pirro it 's a small , slim , volume , one that could quite easily be overlooked when grouped among the vast array of unschooling books out there , but hopefully wo n't be , because it 's a wonderful read ! described as an unschooling manifesto , this book is exactly what it sounds like reasons why the author is an unschooler ! delivered in short , bite sized pieces , each reason delivers a clear point , something to think on , and this format makes it very readable , whether you read it straight through like i did , or just flip open a page for a short , inspiring thing to remind you why you 've chosen unschooling ! divided into two sections , the first reasons are basically anti school why the author is not a compulsory schooler and let me tell you , those reasons are very convincing not that i needed any convincing , obviously p ! covering such things as school steals your freedom , school rewards conformity , and drugging the kids , i wish i could convince some pro school people i know to read it , since hopefully it would shake their perceptions on schooling a bit ! the second section is reasons why the author is an unschooler , and what wonderful reasons they are from staying up late , to real learning happens in the real world , the author details some of the wonderful reasons we unschool , highlights the perks , as it were , of living this free life i read the entire book aloud to my mom , with frequent pauses in reading to discuss one point or another , and we both agree that it was a lovely read inspiring , thought provoking , and just generally a good way to pass a gloomy fall afternoon ! highly recommended if you want to read more from ps pirro , you can check out her blogs , over the wall and crooked mile also of note , this is the first in a series of sorts , as i 've got several other books on unschooling and self directed learning that i'm planning on reading and reviewing , so keep a look out for future posts about great unschooling books ! peace , idzie you might also like review of for the sake of our children review of the teenage liberation handbook review of a rule is to break a child 's guide to anarchy ways to help someone love reading linkwithin
