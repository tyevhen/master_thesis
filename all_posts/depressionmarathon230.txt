one of the symptom busting techniques i have learned in dialectical behavioral therapy is to build positive experiences , and i 'd say this week i did enough building to construct a house ! i had a really good week i built positive experiences working with others , helping a friend , celebrating another friend , and taking good care of myself throughout the week i feel so fortunate i had a great week at work my patients were particularly rewarding to work with this week sometimes that happens i ca n't explain it i just had the pleasure of treating a group of very motivated , hard working , fun and appreciative patients it made work very enjoyable , and more importantly i felt like i made a difference that 's always nice i think i also made a difference helping a young man i know it was my pleasure to assist him as he prepared for his first job interview we went over his resume , how to write a cover letter , and every aspect of the interviewing process from the hand shake to thanking the interviewer for his time , including practicing actual questions and answers , we covered it all it was awesome ! i mentored this young man when he was in high school to see him now , all grown up , and to still be called upon for assistance , is absolutely one of the most rewarding experiences of my life i'm so proud of him it was my friend wendy 's birthday this past week i had fun surprising her at work i brought her some good tollhouse cookies , a bouquet of flowers , and her favorite , diet pepsi wendy has been so kind , generous and supportive over these last years she 's been a true friend i try not to let an opportunity to show her how much i care for and appreciate her pass by i also cared for myself this week i'm happy with my stable mood , and i'm feeling more functional than i 've felt in a long time jet and i ran days for a total of miles , including a challenging , hilly miler today i feel like i'm getting back into racing form i continued to work on my eating this week , and i ate well i stayed away from the sweets , which i love that 's a first ! i'm still not losing the weight i 'd like to lose , but my clothes are fitting better , which is satisfying finally , i took my medications as prescribed , slept when i needed to sleep , and attended all my meetings and therapy appointments it was a good week filled with positive experiences i'm grateful and pleased
