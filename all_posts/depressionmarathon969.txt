i have n't written yet this weekend because i 've been having a long , hot , lazy , sleepy , tough running time so far not sure if it 's the weather , or a dip in my mood , or hormonal , or sleep apnea , or what i'm not sure it it 's anything at all perhaps it just is it just is hot and humid i grew up in a lakeside community where many people do n't even have air conditioning i do n't do humid very well i ran the longest miles i 've run in years yesterday i hit the wall hard at mile three at mile i was back at home dropping off puck and taking in any sustenance i could find the fact that i even went back out was amazing i contemplated quitting more than once the second mile leg took more than an hour to complete i was drenched in sweat i could n't seem to get enough to drink i did n't have any gas in my tank my legs felt like jelly you name it , i was struggling with it it was a long , long run after my run , i slept and slept and slept do n't get me wrong , i had plenty of other things to do i just could n't eating made me tired watching tv made me tired taking care of puck made me tired thinking of doing anything made me tired so i slept you 'd think a person would n't be able to sleep much after sleeping practically an entire day away , yet here i am sleeping again today i slept all night i slept into the morning i made it to an aa meeting , which of course made me tired , so i slept some more five miles are on the schedule today , but i'm waiting for the sun to go down and my energy to come up i'm certain the former will happen , less clear of my chances for the latter it 's been a long , strange weekend i'm trying not to worry about it i'm trying to just let it be what it is besides , my mood seems okay , and i did get my long run done the rest is just gravy , right ? it would be nice , however , to wake up !
