for a christian leader to pass judgment on a christian suffering from depression by saying , you 're depressed because you do n't have enough faith , or you need to have more faith , demonstrates not only a lack of sensitivity that beggars belief , but also demonstrates the depth of the leader s ignorance to demonstrate how such comments are so far off the mark , let us take a moment to consider what king david wrote in psalm psalm a psalm of david o lord , hear my prayer , listen to my cry for mercy in your faithfulness and righteousness come to my relief do not bring your servant into judgment , for no one living is righteous before you the enemy pursues me , he crushes me to the ground he makes me dwell in darkness like those long dead so my spirit grows faint within me my heart within me is dismayed i remember the days of long ago i meditate on all your works and consider what your hands have done i spread out my hands to you my soul thirsts for you like a parched land selah answer me quickly , o lord my spirit fails do not hide your face from me or i will be like those who go down to the pit the persecution afflicted upon king david by his enemies has lead him to the depths of depression , as we can see as he laments that he has been crushed to the ground , that he feels like he is dwelling in darkness like those long dead , and that his spirit has grown faint and his heart dismayed overwhelmed , david cries out to god to save him quickly lest he becomes like those who go down into the pit which could refer to the grave or hell we see david pouring his heart out before god there is no empty religious rhetoric in a vain attempt to comfort himself he makes no pretence that everything is fine yet in all this david is not demonstrating a lack of faith rather , although he is going through a very difficult time , david has found the courage to honestly express exactly how he is feeling the intensity of david s suffering is so devastating that his life has been shaken to the core yet even as so many aspects of his life are crushed , we get to see what is left the very foundations he is standing on let us keep reading psalm let the morning bring me word of your unfailing love , for i have put my trust in you show me the way i should go , for to you i lift up my soul rescue me from my enemies , o lord , for i hide myself in you teach me to do your will , for you are my god may your good spirit lead me on level ground for your name 's sake , o lord , preserve my life in your righteousness , bring me out of trouble in your unfailing love , silence my enemies destroy all my foes , for i am your servant so what are the unshakeable foundations in david s life that have withstood these terrible trials ? it is his trust in god i have put my trust in you , and i hide myself in you this proves that it was not a lack of faith in god that led to david s dire circumstances or depression in fact , it was his faith in god that sustained him throughout that dreadful trial and so is the case with so many if not most christians who are suffering from depression and other disabilities such as long term illnesses and handicaps it is their faith in god that sustains them through such trials , that helps them keep going and not give up when so many others have done so my diary has entries very similar to psalm , such as this one th may boy it is hard , it is so hard the deep pain is gone , but i m still a mess this is one difficult road , and i feel for all those who have had to tread it before me the old fears and doubts which swamped me before rise up against me , but i have found that if i don t examine and analyse them , then they don t overcome me , i don t fall i try to keep my eyes on jesus , to trust him , to rely completely upon him how i long to be normal again , as i believe this will end one day the recovery will be slow , i think it needs to be , i could n't cope with anything instant i'm beginning to see some hope for the future , which is good i guess but it still seems so distant the bible says to consider it joy to endure trials , i must say that there has been no joy in this trial it defies any previous experience known to me but i ve been forced to trust god when it seems he has abandoned me i have been forced to come to a place where i have trusted him without feeling like doing so all i want to do is cry out that he had abandoned me , that he is not faithful but he is faithful and i know that he is faithful and true he is jesus the fact is that depression destroyed my life goals and for a time , turned my life into a living hell yet in the midst of that hell i did not walk away from god or give up on him instead , i clung to jesus like a shipwreck survivor clinging to a life raft , and he did not let me down he sustained me , helped me to cope and keep going even during the blackest phase when i could not feel him doing so and then , in his timing , he led me out of that place to greener pastures and as i continued to trust him , he used the trial for good , drew me closer to him , set me free from lifelong anxieties , and helped my faith to grow so that i would be better equipped to deal with future trials now that is faith trusting in god when our world falls apart anyone can say , i trust in god ! when they are well off , healthy or their life has no problems , but how deep is such faith ? gold is purified by fire and the bible uses the same analogy regarding the maturing of our faith faith grows and matures when tested by the fiery trials that come our way praise be to the god and father of our lord jesus christ ! in his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead , and into an inheritance that can never perish , spoil or fade kept in heaven for you , who through faith are shielded by god 's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time in this you greatly rejoice , though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials these have come so that your faith of greater worth than gold , which perishes even though refined by fire may be proved genuine and may result in praise , glory and honour when jesus christ is revealed though you have not seen him , you love him and even though you do not see him now , you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy , for you are receiving the goal of your faith , the salvation of your souls peter these judgmental leaders who say , if you had more faith you would not be depressed , or would not have this or that illness or handicap , are suffering from faulty theology to the extreme ! faith does not prevent us from going through trials such trials develop our faith i would go so far as to say that those christians who trust in god to sustain them through depression and other disabilities actually have a much stronger and deeper faith than leaders who tell them that they need to have more faith the fact is that these accusers have obviously never been through such a trial otherwise they would have never made the accusation in the first place god uses such storms and trials to develop our faith , and this developing of our faith will assist us throughout the rest of our lives consider it pure joy , my brothers , whenever you face trials of many kinds , because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete , not lacking anything james honestly , if such people stopping being so aloof , and instead of standing back at a distance and passing judgements , were to get close enough to someone suffering from depression , and upon seeing what they endure on a daily basis and yet continue to trust in god and cling to him , and if these accusers honestly cared about the depth of their own faith , they should fall on their knees and ask , please god , put me through such a trial so that i too can have faith like that all verses from the niv tags christians who judge christians for having depression and anxiety
