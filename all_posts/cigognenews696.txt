romantic love exists emotional attachment exists yet they involve different brain structures and different biochemistry than what drives pure , lustful sex once there is attachment or love , a separation can cause pain oxytocin helps to quiet this pain and can function very much like other neurotransmitters and inhibit suffering to listen to my patients is to understand the terrible pain of a child separated from his parent the cry of separation is an attempt to bring that parent back close again it is true in nearly all animal forms there is a structure within the brain known as the cingulate cortex , which is responsible for that cry this cortex is like an arc overlaying the limbic feeling area and also deals with aspects of emotion this area plays a role in maternal care and loving the cingulated cortex is responsible for making the chemicals of comfort , and is also involved in inducing a sense of empathy , the ability to feel what others are feeling the cingulate cortex is endowed with endorphins , internally produced painkillers when animals cry as a result of separation from their mothers , these painkillers surge forth to ease the pain when such a separation is abrupt and goes on for a long time , the baby s pain becomes imprinted in the brain and remains it is more pain than what a young body can tolerate mother nature knows that a baby needs two parents to care for him pair bonding is the result of two adults becoming attached , having sex , having a child , and loving that child with the love these parents themselves received early in their own childhoods , they have the oxytocin and vasopressin that enables them to love their own child love is the foundation , therefore , for survival because when it is lacking , the child does not get the love he needs and he suffers , and the system becomes skewed and dislocated later , there may be disease and premature death as a deviated system is forever out of whack a baby needs to be caressed and feel the sense of touch , which is the baseline of love without it , the brain changes and is less adaptive alterations inside a pregnant woman , who does not want her baby , can affect the brain development in the womb so that the frontal cortex of the fetus becomes impaired this has implications for later learning and adaptation the mother 's attitude , if not loving , adversely affects her fetus it is one reason that we cannot be taught to love later on , though we can be taught to behave in a sociable manner love is not something to be taught it is something we learn through our experience when the stimulating hormone , dopamine , and the repressive hormone , serotonin , are both at proper levels , there can be feeling and love when serotonin is too high , there is too much repression and the ability to love is less when dopamine is too high there is too much agitation and not enough cuddliness to allow love a proper balance is needed among all the hormone systems this is particularly true with oxytocin in females and vasopressin in males after sexual orgasm , both of these levels rise by hundreds of percent in both parties , as if to say that attachment and closeness are part of sex or perhaps should be , according to nature it 's nature 's way of saying that sex should be taken seriously and is part of the syndrome of romance constant random sex has nothing to do with love and is more or less a release of tension it actually contradicts nature however , there are two different brain biochemical systems involved one for pure sex and the other for attachment we can be attached to someone and still have sex with someone else without love there is evidence that in the latter case sport sex the oxytocin and vasopressin levels are lower what are we to make of all this ? that love exists and it is has physical effects it can sculpt our brains early on it is an intimate part of sex , and it ensures healthy development , both physically and mentally love is not an ethereal entity , but something we can measure it may be a more accurate gauge of our state of being than all the protestations of love we might make love really does make the world go round
