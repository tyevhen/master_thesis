i know that you are waiting to hear about our nih appointment , but i am still processing some of it and frankly not quite ready to talk about it yet everything is fine it was just a lot , that s all also , i need to vent this is still autism awareness month right ? or more appropriately in cases , autism acceptance month , or autism action month i actually prefer both of those so here s the thing many of us autism families just don t tell you much yes , i have a stinking blog about my family s life with autism , i know but even here , most of the time my writing is reserved for funny stories , or really major life medical events the day to day , which by the way , is just grueling , is not entertaining , it is not glamorous , there are no heroes and there is not much to say except that i m freaking exhausted and half the time feel like my kids are snickering behind their doors , saying almost ! we almost tipped her over the edge tonight how much further do we have to go ? ? and as a mom i feel chronically inadequate , and judged mostly , judged my kids don t act like other kids , they just don t and while it s not anything that i did , and i know that , i am fragile i am very sensitive to comments from others , and quite often more willing to accept the negative about myself , it s always just been easier for me to believe those things than it is for me to believe you are an amazing mother or you are doing a great job this brings me to the point of why , even though i share here , i keep my boys diagnoses from many people in my life honestly , i don t want to hear it and even when i think i have heard everything , there is always some special person who exceeds my expectations when it comes to ignorance and flat out rudeness i have been at my current job for almost years , so since before i was even pregnant with jack all of my direct coworkers , aka , all of the transplant coordinators on my team know about the boys diagnoses i mean , i take fmla for appointments , and have therapies and iep meetings in the middle of the workday , so that s kind of necessary plus , we work fairly closely for people who have rarely met face to face anyway , i shared this information with much trepidation , and frankly it is still hard to share if there is a new team member , but with those guys , i do it and everyone has been extremely supportive , for which i am extremely grateful however , i have two other large groups of people i work with on a daily basis case managers that work for the same company as i do who i speak with about my patients and then transplant coordinators from all of the different hospitals that i work with i know many of these professionals well in a work way , so you know , hardly at all , but we can talk and joke for quite a while when we call each other almost none of these people know that my kids have autism to put this in perspective , these people did know when i was out on maternity leave years ago i have worked with them for that long still i do not share i am unwilling to risk one of the very predictable reactions which are a how do you do it ? ? ? you poor thing ! your kids are so lucky keep fighting , sis boom bah ! ! this is a positive reaction of all the possibilities this is what i hope for i still don t want it because it is emotionally exhausting to go through this dance over and over again , but i will take it over the other options b oh , my nephew twice removed who i met once in has autism can t remember his name right now , but he had some speech and now he s fine your sons will be fine c i am sure they are fine autism is so over diagnosed these days heck i would probably have autism if i was a kid now well , if these are your best social skills no i will not be mean d that s just the designer diagnosis of the decade back when my kids were little it was blank someone told me my kid had it , but i took care of it by blank and they are fine now this is by far the worst one why is d the worst ? well let s see , first it invalidates what my family is going through , which is always special it implies that my kids don t really have any issues , but the professionals who love to label everyone with something have chosen to put my kids in this box and i , as a sucky parent , have accepted this box if only i were strong like this person , i would have persevered , ripped the label off of my child , and strong armed my way through a system that clearly doesn t recognize how perfect my child actually is well duh this happened to me on thursday one of the transplant coordinators at a facility which will remain nameless , who covers an organ which i will also leave to the imagination , was talking to me about her husband who has been ill i was expressing my concern , when she started talking about how uncomfortable the cots are for caregivers in the hospital i can relate to this from staying with nate in the past , and with our upcoming trip to nih , and stay on just such a cot , i felt her pain i shared this with her , and explained that the boys have autism this is one of the coordinators i have worked with since first time sharing seriously and so it began my reminder of why i never tell anyone i will first remind you that this woman is a nurse ha so , she starts going on and on about how the thing was adhd when her son was little , and she could tell people thought he had something wrong with him , so she took it upon herself to fix it how , pray tell , did she fix her kid s adhd all by herself ? by strapping him in his high chair and leaving him there , to teach him to sit still when he needed a break from that , she isolated him in his playpen so the space was limited apparently this worked like a charm when he was older and got one negative report at school , she walked through the hallways at the school and stood in the doorway daily giving him , and i quote , the stink eye and that took care of that how do i explain that likely my son s aide , special educator , speech therapist , teacher and ot might think it a bit odd if they turned around and saw me sneering at jack in the doorway ? especially if the office didn t notify them when i came through security that i was coming in for a stink eye therapy session seriously ? and ya think you know someone thank gawd for instant messaging at work , so i could vent to my coworkers , one of whom said wow , great thinking mommy dearest the other said crap , i totally forgot to tell you about high chair therapy , sorry about that ! seriously , she could have saved me a lot of time and money so this is someone i have worked with for years , who is a nurse and this is the reaction i get autism awareness not happening so while i would prefer autism acceptance and action , clearly we have not gotten past step in the process how depressing is it , as a parent , especially one who works in the health caring professions , to realize that ? please stop judging a situation you know nothing about people if i had wanted to , i could have explained to this individual that both of the boys have been diagnosed at some of the most reputable institutions in the world hopkins , children s national medical center , nih just to name a few , that this is a medically diagnosed condition , and one that both kids have been having professional therapies for for years i could have explained how involved their iep s are , or the fact that even with all of these interventions , we have needed to have the kids in different elementary schools thus far , and our oldest isn t even years old yet i could have talked about how difficult it is to take the boys anywhere without encountering a meltdown of some kind instead i said , i really hope your husband feels better soon have a good weekend next time i call , i will say , wow nice weather we have been having or did john doe who tested positive for heroin ever show up for his consult ? ? i will not say , how is your son s treatment for his likely severe , intractable , and yet unexplained claustrophobia going ? has he blamed you yet ? has his son fallen out of his highchair yet because he for some reason that he cannot explain refuses to strap him in ? nope , i will pretend this little conversation never happened i will go back to being jennifer with the authorization for it s much less disturbing
