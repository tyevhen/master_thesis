it was dark and cold when i began my run just before am oh , and it was raining it was n't a hard rain , more of a misting , thick rain puck and i did a mile loop through the woods there is almost nothing i enjoy more than watching puck race freely through the trees his obvious joy makes me very happy i figured the rain would subside by the time the sun came up but as i dropped puck at home , it only rained harder i added some dry mittens over my thin gloves a warm , dry headband soon followed it did n't matter by miles i was soaked the rain played with me throughout my run sometimes it rained hard , other times it threatened to quit but quit it never did by mile fourteen , as i turned even further from home , i could only chuckle running miles alone was difficult enough adding the cold , soaking rain certainly heightened the challenge but i am a runner , and i did it i reached miles one block from home i finished with cold hands , sloshing shoes , and soaked clothes i was wet to the bone i bought ice for my typical post run ice bath , but i just could n't do it today my warm shower and fuzzy sweats were just too inviting i joined puck for our after run nap nice i'm proud of myself it was a good day
