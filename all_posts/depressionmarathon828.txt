i finally managed to pull myself out of bed long enough to get out of my house today i'm still feeling poorly , but i 've recovered enough to head back into civilization i went to my aa meeting this morning it was nice to see my sponsor and good to be around like minded souls for an hour my sponsor approached me before the meeting and said , i know you 're feeling poor physically , but how 's this ? she was pointing to her head how refreshing she was worried about my mood i was impressed maybe that does n't seem like a big deal to those of you without depression , but it was a big deal in that one statement , she recognized and acknowledged that illness can , and often does , impact my mood fortunately , i 've been able to keep the depression monster at bay up to this point it was nice to be able to report that , and it was just as nice that she asked the question after my meeting , i walked over to my gym for a swim but when i got there , a cable strengthening class was just about to begin , so i jumped in i was n't sure if i would be able to handle it , but after minutes i was still standing i swam for minutes after that i was really tired once i finished , but i was also really satisfied with the effort it felt good to be on my feet moving my body again needless to say , all i could do once i got home was nap , and that 's exactly what i did ahhhhh my productive day continued with laundry , vacuuming , and generally cleaning up my messy house tonight , i 've got dinner and a movie with friends i'm not sure how social i 'll be , but it will be a nice end to a pretty good day
