ugh i'm still under the weather , and the sub zero temperatures outside certainly are not helping ! at least the sun is coming out that 's helping brighten my mood a bit if it was warmer , i think i might at least be able to manage a walk but there 's no way with the wind and cold we have today not much has changed since my last post my chest is still stuffed with congestion i'm still tired with little energy or motivation to do more than sit whatever this thing is , it is really hanging on , and on , and on i fear i am losing the last remnants of any fitness i may have had jet is still as cute as ever he 's right now playing with multiple toys at once i think he 's potty trained , as he comes to get me to go outside now , and he has n't had any accidents in the house for at least one week i'm thrilled that process was n't as difficult as i had feared it would be i 've taken him to work at least four times , including into a new building yesterday , and he 's doing great it 's really wonderful perhaps i will look into making him an official therapy dog on this day , i typically write a post about an anniversary of sorts it was years ago today , as far as i recall , that i nearly took my life fortunately , i was unsuccessful the attempt began my foray into the mental health system i got help , and until years ago , i got well i do n't know why i did n't devote an entire post to the subject today i thought about it it would likely be more interesting than this one but i just did n't feel the need to more than mention it i am glad i'm not in that dark place today well , jet 's finally worn himself out , and i'm worn out from simply being upright i guess it must be nap time i'm really hoping i'm able to step back into life soon right now i feel like i'm on the outside looking in eventually , i 've got to rejoin the ranks of the living i'm looking forward to that
