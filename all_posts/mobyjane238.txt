thanks so much for your advice because i was not really showing my child the love in the past i think hugs and kissing my child will change a lot i still do not know why i sometimes feel super sensitized and causes me troubles with my family and people the only way i know is to accept that feeling according to dr claire weekes that book is very helpful for my symptoms but still the sudden sensitized brings me down and last for days regards r dear r you are welcome love always works and remember to be gentle with yourself a b curtiss
