i ca n't fix your problems no matter how bad i want to take you in my arms and kiss your face that stupid smile with the dimples make you feel true love , uninhibited by conditions or expectations but i know that although i hate to admit it , i do have expectations though i would rather call them hopes hopes that you will realize you need fixing hopes you will ditch those friends you get plastered with or at least find a new hobby hopes that you will change your mind about what you said about commitment hopes i could be good enough to be the one to make you change it but i do n't want to be one of those girls who sees a man as a project i want to love you for who you are unconditionally i wish i could sit by your side a thousand more times and hear you pour out your secrets i never told you how special i felt to be privy to what you seldom spoke it was my drug light stuff compared to what you 've done as i understand , but heavy and heady for a lightweight like me it killed me when you went silent i worried for a week whether you were okay but did n't want to push you i know you hurt the night you opened back up , but it was one of the best nights of my short , stupid life you let me see that vulnerable side again , but we laughed together as much as we sat in stony silence you asked me what i thought , and maybe that made me drunk on power , knowing that for once i was needed looking back , i think you just needed someone to talk to but at the time it was the hit i needed to get hooked on you and i 've been craving it ever since i 've never been high or drunk maybe that 's why you do n't want me i'm too naive but i have my reasons i'm too anxious and grew up too sheltered plus i'm such a wreck sometimes i'm scared if i started , i might never stop kind of like you but i told you that once , did n't i sometimes i wish i 'd told you i was worried worried you might be coping with things the wrong way i just wanted to be supportive when you felt like you had failed because to me , you will never be a failure but , shit , how i worry about you it eats away at me sometimes , wondering if i should have said more , imagining what you 're up to all the same shit , i miss you it 's stupid , knowing you do n't care too much about me any more , but i pray for you sometimes since i ca n't talk to you , i'm not sure what else to do but love you from afar and beg a deity to maybe give me a chance to be the one who will change your mind to think of white dresses instead of the white powder that sometimes clouds your mind shit , i miss you i try to shove those feelings deep down cuz i know its a lost cause but right now , laying back that night in my head as i curl up in my twin bed , my mind always drifts to what i 'd rather be doing with you it 's funny cuz i know i know right now you 're probably fucking her , stupid wasted but i ca n't shake you not after i 've seen your heart naked
