if you 've been around here for several years , you know i had a right hip injury which required surgical intervention in the past i tore my right hip labrum many years ago it went undiagnosed for years despite many visits to several doctors , the last of whom , an orthopedic resident at the world famous mayo clinic , told me to see a psychiatrist because she did n't know what was wrong and therefore determined i was faking it shortly after this insult , i took a physical therapy continuing education hip course taught by a european instructor he described my symptoms exactly , as he taught us about labral tears turns out european doctors had been diagnosing and treating labral tears for years , while only two doctors in the united states , at that time , were in the know thankfully , one of them , dr palmer , was located in stillwater , minnesota , just minutes up the road i had my first arthroscopic surgery in i was pain free for the first time in years being stupid , i reinjured my hip , had another procedure in , and was again pain free now , eight years later , i 've been having trouble again i did n't do anything stupid this time the pain has been coming on gradually over the past months when it began , i recognized the ache in my groin immediately it was my labral pain of course i hoped it would just pass , but it did n't , so i finally returned to dr palmer a couple of weeks ago an injection helped , but the follow up d ct scan showed bony irregularities , likely congenital , to both my femur leg bone and my acetabulum hip socket which together are causing a pinching of my labrum a ring of soft tissue which helps hold the leg bone in the hip socket if any of you have had shoulder impingement , this is very similar to what 's going on in my hip fortunately , this is not a running injury in fact , my hips and knees looked great on x ray i have beautiful joints this is a pinching of soft tissue sitting is actually my most uncomfortable position but i do feel the ache in my groin most of the time now it needs to be fixed , and that means another arthroscopic surgical procedure hopefully , this will be the last , as the d ct very clearly identified the areas which need to be addressed the bony irregularities will be smoothed out so the labrum has room and wo n't be pinched and i 'll again be without pain i 've decided to put off the surgery until after i run the chicago marathon this october dr palmer has given me the okay to continue training running wo n't make anything worse i'm waiting until after chicago because while i 'll be able to walk immediately after surgery , i will not be allowed to run , jump , or squat for three months following the procedure that means no training until mid to late january , that puts boston , , in question , but i 've done boston three times i 've never run chicago my training is going very well , and i'm really looking forward to experiencing all that the chicago marathon has to offer i'm feeling very hopeful that this surgery , guided by the incredible d ct scan , will finally take care of what 's been an on and off injury for close to years now while it has n't really affected my running , it 's no fun to be in pain i'm looking forward to no longer having to endure that familiar , lingering ache in my right groin , and it will be really great to be able to sit without discomfort prayers are , of course , appreciated
