everyone everyone fears their own death but everyone has a vague faith in an afterlife everyone goes to the parade but everyone forgets their umbrellas everyone goes to see strippers but everyone knows it was only for a bachelor party everyone has had diarrhea but everyone denies soiling their pants everyone has bad credit but everyone can buy a car everyone means to exercise more but everyone is the victim of television everyone has a pet of some kind but everyone has to clean up after them everyone loves the rain but everyone hates getting wet everyone loves to party but everyone knows party is a code word for drinking and drugs everyone says they like poetry but everyone says they don t understand it everyone is opposed to war but everyone watches it happen everyone went to college but everyone didn t graduate everyone s future is rosy but everyone s past is an ankle weight everyone lives selflessly for others but everyone hoards chocolates and dope everyone s had homosexual contact but everyone denies it everyone has prejudices but everyone loves blacks and jews everyone is afraid to speak up in class but everyone knows the answers everyone was properly breastfed but everyone sucked on a bottle , too everyone loves nature but everyone prefers an rv everyone has written a book but everyone is unpublished everyone follows celebrities but everyone says they don t care everyone believes in god but everyone evades church everyone has been told they re dying but everyone has outsmarted their doctor everyone is sensitive to a fault but everyone is a hard ass about money everyone loves to dance but everywhere the dance floors are empty everyone could have been a rock star but everyone didn t have time to practice everyone could have been gandhi but everyone didn t want to wear diapers everyone could have been lincoln but everyone didn t want to be that ugly everyone could have been dr king but everyone was too white everyone could have been a god but everyone had other things to do though formulaic and over generalized , i nevertheless find this poem entertaining in its depiction of human foibles i seem to be running ahead of my blog , as i now have two new poems i haven t posted yet my crying jags come twice a day now , sometimes three times , in general at am and pm , with other occasions dependent on circumstances , as when i saw my psychiatrist yesterday or when kathleen foolishly asks me , how are you doing ? or worse , how are you feeling ? it s that personal connection to others who care that really slays me i suppose i feel unworthy , or perhaps it s that i feel safe revealing my inner sadness to someone i trust but my sadness is generic , there is no object to it , it just is naturally the frontal cortex always seeks a reason out i don t like where i m living , i miss my children , i m a failure as a poet , what s the point , i m bad with money , i should do better by kathleen , yada yada all these points are irrelevant , i assure you when the primitive part of the brain is askew , when the amygdalas and limbic system malfunction , the neocortex what distinguishes us as humans , what allows us self consciousness , reason and language seeks a reason feelings should have antecedents , the brain knows that much but the brain knows too little in severe depression the sadness and anxiety are self generating the brain is stuck like a scratched record and the goal of treatment is to free the brain from the reptile feedback loop that constantly renders your feelings inappropriate to your situation to use a simple test , i have been blissful under the worst of circumstances and suicidal under the best so one question i have asked my patients is if you won the lottery tomorrow would you be any happier ? the truly depressed answer no on the positive side , look how many words i ve spilled on the nuances of depression it seems an endless subject and i suppose it is but it must be kind of depressing reading about it i hope today s poem brings a chuckle kilorats , ce
