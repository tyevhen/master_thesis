people seem to have a lot of ideas about what types of experiences other people especially children , teens and young adults should be having thus we get a whole bunch of faux concerned or , hey , maybe some actually concerned individuals saying but what about prom ? that was such a great night for me how are children supposed to learn about adversity ? i grew stronger through dealing with bullies it s about the whole college experience , though ! that s where i learned to live independently some things , like the bullying , i believe are wrong no matter what but for other things , they can definitely be important milestones in many peoples' lives they do n't have to be , though what some experience as a milestone , others wo n't feel to be a big deal , and still others will never have that experience and not miss it at all this is n't just the case in events and milestones related to schooling , either for example people who espouse travel as a form of self discovery frequently seem rather dismissive of people who don t like to travel , and dismissive even of those who do like traveling but are merely tourists , and are not properly pursuing self discovery through life on the road , and backpacking , and couchsurfing or how some people believe that all young adults should experience living entirely on their own , without even roommates , as some attempt to learn how to be a real adult people seem to frequently make the mistake of thinking that because something is meaningful and helpful in their own lives , then it must be meaningful and helpful in everyone s lives which means everyone should do x , y , or z important thing as a right of passage or a way to find yourself sharing what s worked in your own life can be really helpful and inspiring to others but don t make the assumption that just because it worked for you , it s going to work for most or even many other people we re all individuals with different paths to pursue this is one of the reasons i love unschooling so much as i 've said numerous times , when asked what my favourite thing about unschooling is or why i think unschooling is important , one of the best things about unschooling , in my mind , is the personalization of our education , as we pursue what we truly want and need to learn this holds true for learning without college , as well , and attempting to build a life as an adult that feels in line with our desires , our values , and our strengths it s wonderful knowing that people have gained joy and personal growth in their life thanks to an experience they had in school , or an epic backpacking trip they went on , or painting every day , or living entirely alone in a cabin in the woods , or adopting a religion it s great reading about the myriad of ways people are living meaningful lives and doing important work but of all those paths , we ll each find different ones inspiring , different ones that make us go wow , i want to do that ! there s much good to be had in embracing a variety of ways of living , as long as they do no harm to others realizing that what s right for us may not be right for our sibling , or our friend , or a stranger on the internet , is important as we share what 's worked in our own lives in embracing life learning , a philosophy all about finding the most meaningful and personally relevant path in each individual 's life , it seems to me we 're making an important step in creating a world where we all have a lot more personal power in the shape our education , and our life , takes you might also like reasons i'm glad i grew up unschooling learning advice from a learning life in praise of the unexceptional because unschooling a short interview with an idzie making the choice and linkwithin
