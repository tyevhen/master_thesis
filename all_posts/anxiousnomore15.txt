i have often heard about anxiety a lot of times being about the future or the past but not usually about the present i saw this quote today and i like it because its a reminder to try to stay in the present sure it 's not that easy to read that and say ok i will stop worrying now ! but its still something to think about my good friend told me when he feels panic coming on he gets out a jar of lemons and smells them because he is trying to associate the smell as something comforting and it helps bring him back to the present not sure if that would work for everyone , i 've never tried it , but it sounds like an interesting idea what are some ways you try to stay in the present instead of worrying about your past or the future ? if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email you might also like morning anxiety anxiety scale prevent panic have a game plan maintaining control when anxiety is triggered linkwithin
