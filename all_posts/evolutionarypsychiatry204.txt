a little post to keep me somewhat organized though in many respects i do n't like organization as it stomps my thinking patterns a bit however , as life gets more complex , organization keeps the head above water so here we are ! contacting me through the psychology today blog and through some comments on this blog i do receive requests for contact unfortunately , these requests quickly drop off the top of my email list as i usually think okay , will get back to that when i have time and then i do n't end up having time ! i can tell you i am much , much more likely to answer a specific , narrow question that can be dealt with quickly , or anecdotes about how some aspect of paleolithic traditional style diets either worked or did n't work for you best left in a comment for everyone ! contacts that sound like you want a full psychiatric consultation will likely not be answered i would love to help , but ca n't do a proper job of that without taking a lot of time that i typically do not have also , i'm not likely to do that without getting paid , and it 's illegal and bad practice to do it except in certain very specific contexts in states where i am not licensed i ca n't practice medicine over the internet typically , the questions are something like have you heard of such and such supplement and what do you think of it ? or do you know any other psychiatrists who practice like you do in enter your city here the answer is usually no to both questions , for better or worse in addition , there are often transference issues and other relationship issues that are very important in psychiatric treatment and questions , and often someone will seek my help because their relationship with their doctor or therapist has something broken i can tell you right off that i am not the solution in those cases the best thing to do is to talk to your own doctor or therapist explicitly about the broken part if a mental health professional does n't jump on that as a very important and interesting part of your treatment , time to maybe look around for someone else in your area often the most exciting and helpful changes occur after someone tells me how i am not helping them comments on old posts there are many fabulous , detailed comments left on old posts , and some with very good questions if the winds are blowing right , sometimes i have the time to answer them often i do n't i do generally address questions in comments left in the most recent posts to do last time i left a to do list , i do n't think i did much of it yet with the biggest bugaboo being thyroid still working on it however i have some very specific ideas in mind now and some of the papers already lined up here 's what i would like to cover next a diet and violence b more basic science and genetics epigenetics of mental health that is probably a couple of posts frontal networks , caspi paper , etc dr k thinks i do n't pay enough attention to epigenetics i do think about it a lot but do n't always address it necessarily , especially in the generational context as i prefer to focus on things we can change , and i ca n't do anything about what my grandfather ate c cannabis , psychosis , and comt genetics d paper melissa posted on at hunt gather love about acne brain gut axis e trace lithium and suicide again , and lithium and dementia f oxytocin and attachment g frantic , anxious mice and chronic cardio do n't worry , blogblog , i 'll try to use a mouse whisperer context usually people bring other papers to my attention that jump the queue which is fine by me but all these papers and subjects are interesting , topical , and will broaden our understanding of all the connections and why nutrition is an important piece of the brain environment when one takes a biologic and holistic scientific approach to maximizing brain health whew time to start cleaning the real house happy sunday early morning !
