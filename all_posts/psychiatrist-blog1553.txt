it 's snowing here in baltimore , it 's kind of lovely victor , friend of our blog , told one of his classmates to sit down , it 's only snow , and the boy told him he 'd never seen snow before , they do n't have it in his country of origin it 's not am , but even in the daylight , i'm still worrying about my kid nothing awful , he had an issue at school and we feel he 's gotten a bum rap at a time in his life when having a bum rap is hard , trying to rescue him from the unjust , and roy is quick to tell me that life is unfair and it 's a good lesson to learn early i suppose clinkshrink and roy both have things going on in their lives , roy 's working hard , i keep hoping he 'll do the things i want him to do , but he 's a guy who gets pulled in a lot of directions and judging by the long hours he tells me he 's working , his hospital could use a few good shrinks the blog is suffering a little , i hope not a lot i have n't been visiting my usual blog friends and i hope everyone is well i do peek at the results on our anti psychotic poll and seroquel is winning by a lot if you have n't voted , please do okay , so roy did some leopard thing this weekend yeah leopard someday i 'll be a mac person , too i 'd kind of like an itouch , but will i be able to get the information from my palm pilot over to it ? ? this story is for roy the psychiatrist across the hall from me also did tht imac leopard thing last week before he did , he backed stuff up , but still lost everything in his organizer he had to call patients and ask them when their appointments were oh , and he did it twice with that thought , the judge in hair curlers sent me so cartoons that made me smile i can share them with you ? and finally , we three shrink rappers have been talking about distilling some stuff from the blog into a book i suppose it would be for a different audience , one less likely to visit a blog , but perhaps a glimpse into how shrinks think ? what do you think ?
