it is the end of the semester and i am visiting one of our virtual labs to check on our students' progress , discuss their grades , talk about finals , and hear about their experiences on taking online classes on the morning of my visit , the lab monitor was out of the lab and the students were working diligently on their courses although the lab was small , the majority of the students were quiet , hard working , and on task a lab monitor 's dream however , there was the one student yes , there is always one he arrived late that morning and his presence shattered the silence of the lab like a rock going through a window automatically , the students came alive by telling jokes , singing , and then throwing verbal jabs at one another while there were a few students who were still quiet , this one student started to make fun of the others by making up songs about them as his songs got more offensive , the reactions increased from the other students quiet and not so quiet ones he was relentless and i just could not stand it any longer ! finally , i looked at the kid and said , that is enough i want you to stop right now immediately , it was on and he turned his wrath toward me he became so abusive that i asked him to leave , but he refused ! ! quickly turning to my crisis skills , i looked at the all the kids in the small room and i said , i need everyone out now ! they asked if i was serious and i said that i was very serious after the students walked into the next room , which was the media center , the kid and i had a lengthy discussion it really did n't go the way i wanted it to go the result of our discussion was that the student saw no harm in his comments to the other students and felt that i was overreacting at this point , the student and i had to agree to disagree , but it really made me think of how our virtual students could benefit from some respect education creating safer and respectful classrooms name calling is not attractive ! if i had a penny for every name i heard students call each other , i would never have to worry about reloading my starbucks card for my daily hot green tea chai unfortunately , name calling is everywhere schools , the community , the teachers' lounge , the presidential debates , our homes well , you get the point how can we expect students to act any differently when our conversations , songs , movies , and debates are full of name calling whether intentional or not although we ca n't control what goes on outside of school , we can set up a safe learning environment as a school counselor , it is my responsibility to help our staff create respectful learning environments the anti defamation league has created a working agreement that i am going to take to our lab monitors to help them create a safer and respectful classroom this agreement includes creating an environment that promotes the following characteristics students should be able to listen to each other with respect and remember that not everyone will agree with their views and opinions each student should speak from his or her own experiences and refrain from judging others using i messages can help students speak from their own values and experiences educators can help create an environment where students can ask questions without fear of judgment or criticism school staff can create respect for confidentiality by making sure it is safe for students to share personal experiences while every student has the right to share his or her ideas , it is important that everyone is given the same amount of time to speak and share ideas before taking these ground rules into the lab , i am going to do a little data collection to see how students feel about the climate in the virtual labs after implementing these rules , i will take a post assessment to see if students feel the ground rules made a difference in their learning environment i will update you on how this works !
