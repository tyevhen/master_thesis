a full seven days prior to when i expected to , i was able to run painfree today ! i got a new pair of shoes , donned the compression sleeve over my calf , and set out for a run at noon i ran miles , including six miles at my marathon pace , without pain i'm really happy ! we 'll see how i feel tomorrow , but i think i'm back as i noted in my last post , i spent time with my new friend d over the long weekend things went really well it is too bad we live so far apart , but i'm hopeful we have so many things in common , it 's unbelievable it seems we were meant for each other it 's nice to have the attention of someone special again i 've missed that my mood continues to be good and i'm sure being able to run again will only help that continue it 's really amazing that i can feel so good within just a few months of feeling so low remember that time ? it was n't that long ago ! i'm enjoying life right now , and that 's really nice feeling better reminds me depression can be conquered it 's temporary i ca n't control when it throws a wrench into my routine , but i can control how i attack it i'm glad i attacked it did n't keep me down for as long as i feared it would i'm grateful for that
