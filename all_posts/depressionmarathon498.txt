hello , and happy wednesday ! i had a long work day today , but i got my nap in after work , and now i'm feeling fine i'm tapering big time this week , so i 've been resting on my non running days , including today tomorrow i have a short mile run scheduled , and i 'll probably do a couple slow miles on saturday as a final tune up did i mention i'm running a marathon on sunday ? life is moving along smoothly the financial stress i mentioned last week was relieved slightly with a paycheck i received yesterday my regular job pays me on friday , and i 've got several extra hours coming on that check , so hopefully my relief will be even greater then i'm working some extra hours this week , too i think extra hours will be a fact of life far into the future , and as long as i remain stable , that 's perfectly fine with me i 've not much else to say tonight i'm feeling good life is good i hope for nothing but the same for you
