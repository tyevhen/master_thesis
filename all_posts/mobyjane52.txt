question it 's so helpful to hear about your lack of fear i long to be like you in that regard , i try to picture it sometimes just standing there thinking ha , i am safe , depression cannot get me for more then a few mins ha ! now that sounds like living answer i may have said that i am a pretty fearless person on occasion i probably meant fearless because i am a risk taker and i don t mind dumping myself into a situation where i don t know anybody , and have no idea how the meeting , or conference or whatever will turn out or what others might be expecting of me i figure i will be able to handle anything that comes up with common sense , a spirit of good will and the fact that i m not a quitter , i am honest and i always try to do my best and treat other people as i would like to be treated but of course i cannot be fearless in the strict sense of the word fear is the basic motivating force in a human being we only have one psychological defense mechanism the flight or fight response but to sink down into that fear anxiety unnecessarily is something i have learned not to tolerate in myself there is always something i can do other than think about the fact that suddenly find myself full of fear as soon as i recognize that i am thinking i am afraid i realize that i am not in reality because reality doesn t contain unnecessary fear if you are in fear for your life usually you are too busy at the task at hand trying to save your life to be afraid the definition of reality is giving a pure act of attention to the task at hand also known as being in the now so when the fear makes its appearance i take steps to situate myself in reality as quickly as possible
