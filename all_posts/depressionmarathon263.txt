i'm being silly i know that i'm staying awake nights worrying about what i said , and more importantly did n't say , during filming last thursday did i highlight the stigma enough ? was i compassionate enough ? was i accurate in my description of the variety of symptoms ? did i get across how isolating and debilitating this illness can be ? and on , and on , and on worry thoughts i'm being silly right ? in other news , my mood remains good i am getting a little worn out by the pain from my oral surgery on friday nevertheless i returned to work today , swollen face and all i made it five hours before it got to be too much i actually think the talking i did with my patients and coworkers helped my face swelling decrease a bit i think i look better now than when i went to work this morning the reason i think the mouth pain has worn me down is because i 've noticed i feel overwhelmed with less provocation work was a little overwhelming today , though it was n't at all difficult i'm also a bit overwhelmed by what 's on my to do list for tomorrow , even though there 's not that much to do despite that i'm feeling like i want to curl up on the sofa and avoid it all feeling overwhelmed can be an early warning sign that things are n't going well , so i'm paying close attention to my mood and doing what i can to stay on an even keel that 's why tomorrow you 'll find me putting one foot in front of the other and crossing off one errand after another controlling what i can control is one important piece of maintaining my mood stability
