it 's raining hard outside , and that kind of matches my mood gray wet i'm feeling a little lazy after a long week i have a pile of laundry to do vacuuming and dusting are long overdue i'm tired and a bit cranky , too this dreary mood is likely the result of my long week of training at work the patient care was great , even easy , but the computer documentation was long , tedious , and overwhelming yesterday , i sat for hours while listening to my trainer tell me how to fill out various required documents yes , hours ! my eyes were glazed over , and my brain was mush by the end of the day it was a lengthy end to the long week and let 's not forget my long week included the cat episode on wednesday i 've had a difficult time letting go of that poor cat i ca n't get him out of my head , and i keep replaying the whole scene it 's hard not knowing what happened to him i feel bad for walking out of the vet , distraught i wonder if i should return with in hand , apologize , and inquire as to his condition yet i'm still angry at them for their attacking stance regarding payment as i said , i was clearly distraught and just trying to do the right thing i was in no shape to make rational decisions it 's all still so confusing and sad i hope the cat is okay , or if not , at least i hope he did n't suffer too much the long week stress has haunted me at night , too i keep having drinking dreams when i awoke one morning earlier this week i was sure i had relapsed it 's not all that unusual for a recovered alcoholic to have drinking dreams , but i hate when they are so vivid that i confuse them for reality i had another one last night very annoying ! my sponsor says i should ask god to remove them hmmm i had n't thought of that it 's definitely worth a shot i 'll give it a try tonight speaking of drinking , i'm off to my aa meeting always helpful to hang out with like minded souls when i'm feeling a bit off i'm sure things will be looking up once i leave there i hope so , anyway , because i 've got two workouts to accomplish yet today hopefully , the weather , like my mood , will change soon happiness grows in direct proportion to your acceptance and in inverse proportion to your expectations michael j fox
