i have absolutely nothing to say about my family or my life this evening instead i want to ask for prayers for a very dear friend and her family i do n't want to go into details , i will just say that these are just wonderful , supportive , loving people who are going through a very difficult time when a close friend is going through something scary like this , it 's impossible to think of anything else it 's also a painful reminder that none of us are really in the driver 's seat , that we have to depend on our faith and have confidence in experienced medical professionals so if you could each just take a minute this evening and pray for healing and good health for these friends of mine i would appreciate it greatly and to my friend , i love you and i'm here , as always , any time day , or night
