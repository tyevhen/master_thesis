photo by wuji it seems that when i am not having horrible nightmares of being shot and dying , i am having dreams of being rejected the persons rejecting me vary from night to night , but the theme is always the same i am usually back in high school confronting friends , or crushes , or old flames and all of them do n't want to be around me for some reason i spend the entire night pining for their acceptance and mourning over the lack of it i feel sad , discouraged , and lonely all night long according to dream moods , to dream that you are being rejected , signifies a lack of self worth and alienation of others another website about the symbolism of dreams says , rejection in a dream shows that the dreamer either is frustrated by non acceptance or want to rid himself of certain feelings this seems to go hand in hand with yesterday 's post discussing self esteem ok so i have already admitted that my self esteem could use some work but this is not some dream that i have now and then i have dreams about this almost every night i ca n't stand it i wake up feeling awful what a way to start the day so i do n't want to do it anymore i actually emailed a local radio station that has a dream interpreter on it once a week to have her analyze one of my dreams i ca n't wait to hear her feedback i have heard that before you go to bed you can write your dream out in a journal and then change the ending to be whatever you want it to be then when you have your dream , the new ending will replace the old i should try that maybe i just need a dream catcher any other suggestions of how to stop having these kinds of dreams ? does anyone have similar kinds of dreams ? if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety or add it to your technorati favorites you might also like feelings of rejection lingering how dreaming about positivity actually boosts my confidence the power of nightmares warning anxiety can cause insomnia linkwithin
