yes , today is my birthday it 's rather anticlimactic , as my mood and energy have sunk to new lows nevertheless , i did have a few highlights to my day my mother called , as is her custom , and sang happy birthday over the phone i got a morning delivery of some lovely flowers from my boyfriend , d they are beautiful and fragrant tonight i spent time with my friend , wendy , and she treated me to dinner it was all good i saw my doctor this afternoon not much to report there my mood is low fatigue is knocking me flat i have n't made it to the gym for several days it 's difficult to get out of the house i do n't like to be around others none of these are positive signs but i'm forcing myself out the door i'm at least walking when i can muster the energy i'm doing what i can to ride out the low my doctor is not changing anything yet i'm hanging on for now like birthdays , i know this too shall pass
