lockup doc has a post up on kevinmd he talks about how awkward it is to be a called to consult on a patient who is on a medical or surgical unit of a hospital when the patient has n't been told that a psychiatric consult has been requested the shrink gets to announce to the surprised patient that they were called and the patient may be insulted what s troubling about this all to common scenario is that when consultations are requested of psychiatrists , two key ingredients are often missing first , the reason for the consultation is often unclear second , the consultation is often requested either without the patient s permission or knowledge , or , the patient is informed of the consultation but an inadequate or even inaccurate , potentially insulting explanation is given roy is our c l psychiatrist here at shrink rap , so i 'll let him add to the comments as an outpatient psychiatrist , i'm just never a surprise
