sometimes when i keep getting hit by aftershocks of depressed it helps to keep reminding myself what is happening i tell myself that i know this is depression , that it is caused by my thinking at the moment and that to get out of it , i need to change my thinking i also tell myself that my thought is the one thing over which i have been given complete control but i have not been required to take charge of my thinking i can choose to or not and it is in my best interests to choose to i tell myself that , when i feel bad , my energy is fear based and i have the power to change my energy immediately by changing my thought energy is not like feelings energy is a force that you produce by your thought most people produce it unthinkingly like stuffing down anger , or sending out anger but it is a force that you have immediately control over , unlike feelings so when i find myself slipping into disconnect and alienation and i'm out and about in the world , i choose some passer by to send a healing , or some kind of a prayer or love based thought , or even just thinking that they have their own story to tell and if we sat down to a cup of tea i'm sure i would be fascinated by what they have to tell me about their life it takes a while to get the hang of sending out your loving energy to someone but when you do it , you can immediately see your depression disappear into a love based kind of joy if the love energy does n't stay with you , find another person to focus on when you focus on caring about another person , you cannot , at the same time focus on caring about your own pain just keep going forward keep taking charge of your thought you are always more powerful than your depression always always we are a force for love or fear we can choose which
