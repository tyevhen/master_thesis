i ca n't stand two faced people like i really ca n't stand them i honestly believe that if someone is a bitch enough to put someone down , find the balls to say it to their face i particularly hate two faced girls , they are the cruelest two faced girls do it to be liked , they 're insecure and to feel better about themselves they put other people down i 've worked studied in fashion retail for years , i 've met many an insecure bitch obviously everyone vents about other people , i ca n't claim to have never had a moan about someone else , maybe even a friend , but i would never slate a friend behind their back and be nice to their face if i did n't like them enough to slag them off i would not be friends with them in the first place the thing about two faced people that gets me the most is the lack of sincerity how can i ever trust anything they say when they are quick to put someone else down ? how can i ever be sure that person would n't turn on me in just the same way ? all this is important to me because relationships are important to me my friendships , my family my complete support system is what literally gets me through life i ca n't let fake , two faced , insincere people in my circle , it hurts me too much and over the last five or so years it has hurt me so much recently i was told that i can appear rude initially this really upset me i only ever want to get along with everyone and i would never intentionally be rude well , i would never intentionally be rude unless it was necessary , unless i was sticking up for myself or someone else i care about i think i'm fair , i give people a chance , i do n't follow other people 's opinions , i speak as i find for a while i was hating on this part of my personality , i was wondering if i was to blame for all sorts of fallouts and conflicts that i 've experienced but i 've realised that 's a good part of my personality , it 's an honest , moral outlook i'm extremely straight down the line , trustworthy and full of integrity nothing will ever come before those values
