on monday morning a particularly cold morning i got into my car and turned the key i did not like what i heard the engine made a low groan and it wouldn t start after a few tries it finally did , and that s when i began to work myself up thoughts began to race through my mind what does this mean ? should i get the car checked out ? what type of bill am i looking at ? will i make it to work ? and sensations flowed over my body feelings of heat , quickened breathing , blurred vision , and racing heart a car repair shop is not far from my house , so i drove there , all the while experiencing these disturbing sensations and thoughts when i arrived , i hesitated about going in , knowing that i tend to overreact in such situations and this has cost me real dollars in the past for no good reason i called and knowingly woke up a friend for advice , but he really couldn t help me then i spotted i realized i was going into a panic over a triviality the car was running just fine now , so there was no real danger and , most importantly , i realized that i trained for this with my recovery training , i know how to handle such situations i realized that by waking my friend i was not being group minded , and now i needed to make a decision , as any firm decision would steady me instead of going into the shop , i decided to drive to work since monday i haven t had any car problems , but i m going to check out the battery tomorrow i m very proud of how i handled this situation with the exception of waking up my friend in the past i would have been confused and flustered for days , no matter what course of action i took instead , i assessed the situation , took action , and agreed to live with the consequences , disregarding any discomfort involved and for this i gave myself a hearty endorsement
