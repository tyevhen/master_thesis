yesterday morning i awoke with the familiar butterflies in my stomach and the anxiety levels rising i could feel it getting worse even though i was trying to breathe deeply i started to get really frustrated i was tired of feeling sick i was feeling guilty and annoyed that i was still feeling anxious i started to worry that things would n't get better but if i think about it , i have been rushing this whole process i keep expecting to feel better and then when i do n't i am immediately put into a bad mood so my mantra yesterday was you do n't have to be all better today i really think this lesson is learning to love myself with my anxiety i do n't have to be all better in order to be worthy of love and respect from myself so last night i was reading in the bible and came across a story that was an answer to my prayers it is about a father that brings his son who has a demon inside him to jesus to be healed mark bold and italics added and ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire , and into the waters , to destroy him but if thou canst do any thing , have acompassion on us , and help us jesus said unto him , if thou canst believe , all things are apossible to him that bbelieveth and straightway the father of the child cried out , and said with tears , lord , i believe help thou mine aunbelief this story was another reminder to me that i need to have faith that things will get better and that i need to pray for help with my doubts and frustration so my goal is to try to stay positive and patient even though things are really crappy i do n't want to fall into the victim trap where i revel in the sympathy that others may give me when they hear of my situation i want to be strong even when i feel so weak i do n't just want to endure this , i want to endure it well d c and then , if thou endure it well , god shall exalt thee on high thou shalt triumph over all thy foes so this morning i woke up with panic not worst case panic but pretty severe i had burning in my arms and breathing was n't helping so i told myself its ok if still need to take clonazepam to help me through the day so i took one and although it made me tired for awhile , i am now feeling much better i 'll get to where i want to be someday , but it does n't have to be today i just have to remember that if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email
