can someone help me answer a couple of questions , heres what i m supposed to answer what causes mad cow disease ? how is it transmitted ? what are its symptoms ? whats the diagnosis how do you know you have it ? is there a treatment ? is there a vaccine ? what is the prognosis ? heres what i have answered if anything is wrong or you think i should add something please tell me the causative agent is is a misfolded protein called a prion it can only be transmitted by eating meat , or somehow consuming the prion symptoms are very similar to that of alzheimers diesease and can also cause personality changes , demensia , and hallucinations , also causes porous holes in the brain there is no treatment for mad cow disease there is no vaccine for it and the prognosis is death any additional information or corrections would be great because i have to do a report on this answer i think you re doing great ! maybe you could add some of the visible changes in the affected being question is this ocd , depression , or psychosis ? a brief history of the situation is this years ago i went through a serious bout of depression i had fits of rage and crying and purposely avoided friends and places i enjoyed a doctor put me on lexapro , and antidepressant i got better years later , i have a new problem i thought it was the same old depression with a new twist but it s not my last psychiatrist tried treating me for a problem i had he diagnosed it as depression and said that i also had ocd this was because i had a depressed mood and frequently battled thoughts of anxiety this doctor tried me on a few different medications either they had no effect or they had terrible effects they made me more depressed , anxious , and at one point suicidal they were all small doses , but they showed their effects within days the drugs that had these disastrous effects were imipramine and lexapro i m seeing a new doctor now this one says the root problem is not depression or ocd he says it s psychosis his reasons for his diagnosis are this the obsessive negative thoughts are a manifestation of the paranoia attribute of psychosis these thoughts include worrying about getting diseases , worrying about dying tomorrow from something , worrying about aging or getting alzheimers , worrying about thinning on top , worrying about getting diabetes , worrying that i might be schizophrenic , worrying that i got braindamage from the smell of a dry erase marker , the list goes on and on some of these are too irrational to list some days they re tollerable , other days they make me anxious , even cry , or prevent me from doing my work another symptom that i had described to both doctors was the fact that nearly every task that i start , or even think about starting , causes me stress and anguish as if it were some daunting job having to clean up after a hurricane this is true for nearly everything i do including things i enjoy doing hanging out with friends , just watching a movie alone , or painting which i love to do will sometimes feel this way and compell me to avoid these things the first doctor said that this anxiety over starting things was possibly add he tried me on ritalin for that with equally disastrous results then he tried me on neuropheedback treatment it improved my memory , that i am sure of the second doctor said that symptom was also due to psychosis because it shows there are two thoughts fighting eachother simultaneously with each of these actions i take things do seem much easier for me when decissions are made for me the new doctor s solution was to put me on seroquel , an antipsychotic part of me feels willing to try and hopeful that this might be the long sought after solution to everything , but i am also terrified of meds now after what happened with the last two it feels like well , gator wrestling didn t work let s try shark jumping instead just reading the list of possible side effect of seroquel makes me scared why don t i halucinate then if i have psychosis ? the doctor feels strongly that it is psychosis , but i don t experience halucinations i also do know that i have ocd because as a kid i would ritualistically trace cracks in the ground and felt annoyed if i couldn t i told my doctor i didn t want to try another medication unless he felt damn sure that it would work when all the other backfired majorly he still felt confident that i should go through with it i m still recovering my sanity from the last medication i tried , so i m not eager to comply the big question ow is this am i finnally getting new answers that i have been seeking all along , or am i only finding new questions and getting more lost ? is there anyone out there in this lonely world who has experienced anything related to this and can give me some dirrection ? can neurofeedback help with psychosis as well ? i greatly appreciate any experience you can empart answer i have worked in mental health medical records since i have seen psychiatrists change a diagnosis at the drop of a hat sometimes diagnoses are changed and the medication stays the same i have heard psychiatrists admit that mental illness diagnoses are very subjective i only have a bachelor s degree and i have had psychiatrists change a diagnosis when i let them know the insurance won t bill once i told a doctor the program wouldn t reimburse for ocd and he changed the patients diagnosis to disorgranized schizophrenia , just like that i once asked a doctor why she put major depression as a patient s diagnosis , but in another part of the record it indicated the same patient had bipolar disorder when i asked her which was the correct diagnosis , she told me it doesn t make any difference my impression is that the diagnosis is really only for purposes of billing the insurance company whether it s ocd , psychosis or whatever isn t really all that important what really matters is if the treatment helps or not your question details are very long and i don t have the patience to read the entire thing but when you say some medication didn t help how long did you take it ? did you take it as prescribed by your doctor ? no medication is going to help if you don t give it a chance generally , you would need to take it for at least a month to be able to tell if it s really helping i don t think there is really any point in dwelling on do i have this , or do i have that i don t mean to be crass , but how do you know for certain you aren t just looking for attention ? i have been diagnosed with major depression , dysthymic disorder , and panic attacks sometimes i have symptoms that seem like bipolar disorder or ocd when i was very young , i had symptoms that seemed to be a lot like adhd or mild autism i asked my doctor one time if i might have adhd , and she said even if i did , she would give me the same medication anyway because it appeared to be working pretty well sources worked in mental health since , treated for depression and anxiety since
