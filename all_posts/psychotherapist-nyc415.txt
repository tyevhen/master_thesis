throughout the course of a lifetime , many people disavow important parts of themselves , sometimes consciously , sometimes unconsciously often , these parts are disavowed because they 're connected to painful traumatic emotional problems that remain unresolved then , at some point later on in life , many people realize that they feel something is missing in their lives and what 's missing is the part of themselves that has become buried and lost at that point , people often want to try to reclaim that lost part of themselves reclaiming a lost part of yourself let 's look at a fictionalized scenario , which is based on many different therapy cases with all identifying information changed to protect confidentiality jim when jim was a young child , more than anything , he loved music by the time he was , he taught himself to play a guitar by the time he was , he and his friends formed a rock and roll band and he was using the money he earned at his part time job to pay for formal guitar lessons because his parents could n't afford to pay for his lessons he loved jamming with his band mates they had a strong rapport , especially when they were jamming they played at street parties and local events , and they had a great time more than anything , jim wanted to make a career as a musician but his parents had other ideas since both of them grew up in poor families , they wanted jim to go to college and choose a more practical career path although she worried that jim would struggle as a musician , jim 's mother was a little more understanding she never tried to discourage him from playing but jim 's father was quietly disapproving of his son 's passion for music and the band he spoke to his wife about his concerns , but never told jim he hoped jim would outgrow his love of music and become more practical when jim was , he and his band mates were invited to play at a well known club in the area playing at this club had been jim 's dream since he was a child the club owner had heard them playing at jim 's high school , liked what he heard and approached jim with an invitation to play on the following saturday night jim and his band mates were thrilled , and they practiced all week they invited their families and friends to hear them play and they all showed up , including jim 's parents just before the show , jim and the other boys were nervous and excited they had never played in this type of venue , and they knew that if they played well , the exposure could be great as they began playing and singing , jim could feel that they were really on the people in the audience were really into the music as he saw them on their feet dancing and clapping , jim 's nervousness dissipated as he lost himself in the music reclaiming a lost part of yourself jim could feel that he and his band mates were on by the end of their set , the audience burst into thunderous applause , demanding an encore the club owner jumped onto the stage smiling broadly and clapping he encouraged them to play three more songs to the audience 's enthusiastic applause by the end of the night , the club owner told jim and his friends that he wanted them to play for the next three months at the club he wanted to talk to their parents about signing a contract jim and his band mates were wildly happy this is what they had been dreaming about since they got together but when jim looked over to where his parents were sitting , he knew something was wrong he could see his father sitting with his arms folded looking angry and disapproving his mother was smiling , but she looked worried at the end of the evening , when he went to his parents' table , jim 's father told him that he felt jim and his friends had made fools of themselves on the stage jim was crest fallen he never more humiliated than he had felt at that moment his father would n't even hear about the club owner 's offer jim was devastated as they drove home in stony silence , jim tried to hold back bitter tears in that moment , he felt like he hated his father he was more determined than ever to pursue his music and to show him that he would make it in the music industry when they got home , jim ran upstairs to his room , slammed the door , and threw himself on his bed then , the tears came he could n't believe that his father ruined one of the happiest days of his life afterwards , his mother came to his room and tried to console him she told him that she knew how disappointed he felt she tried to tell jim that , even though his father was harsh , his father was also worried about jim pursuing music as a career she said that the father 's harsh words were his awkward way of trying to prevent jim from making what he thought would be a big mistake she thought the club owner 's offer frightened jim 's father because he saw it as the beginning of jim going down the wrong path jim knew that , even though his mother was more sympathetic and understood how much his music meant to him , she also shared his father 's worries it hurt him that his parents did n't have more confidence in him and they would try to keep from achieving his dream his mother said she would try to talk to his father to try to smooth things over but jim knew that his father , who tended to be stubborn , would n't soften jim knew that his father had made up his mind , and that was that the next day , jim heard from each of his band mates all of them were excited about the night before , and told him that his parents were willing to sign the club owner 's contract jim told them about his father 's reaction but he said he was determined to persevere even if it meant that he forged his parents' signature on the contract later that day , as jim was leaving the house for band practice , jim and his father got into a big argument the argument escalated to the point where jim 's father told him , i have a good mind to forbid you from going to practice ! at that point , jim 's anger and frustration overtook him and he shouted , i hate you ! as he ran out of the house by the time he got to band practice , jim calmed down and he told himself he would apologize to his father when he got home and try to reason with him deep down , jim knew that his father 's reaction came from fear but later on as jim walked home , he saw the flashing lights of an ambulance in front of his house he ran down the block as fast as he could he got to the house to see his mother sobbing and his father being taken out in a stretcher and placed in the ambulance between sobs , his mother told jim that his father had a heart attack and the emts were unable to revive him his father was dead jim was convinced that he had killed his father twenty years later , jim came to therapy because he felt like something was missing in his life , but he was n't sure what it was he was happily married , and they had two beautiful children he liked his job as a high school counselor he just could n't pinpoint why he was feeling so lost as jim talked about his family history , he told me that , after his father died , he put down his guitar and never picked it up again his band mates pleaded with him not to give up his passion but all jim could think about was his last words to his father , telling his father that he hated him and why ? because his father was trying to protect him from , possibly , making a big mistake ? he felt so ashamed and selfish he believed he killed his father jim felt deeply ashamed and filled with sadness , guilt and remorse without jim , the band broke up , and jim and his friends drifted apart as an adult , jim did n't even listened to music anymore recalling his passion for music and his days with his band mates was inextricably and painfully intertwined with the fact that he and his father never reconciled before his father died over time , using somatic experiencing , a mind body therapy , we worked towards separating out his former passion for music from his grief and shame related to his father 's death in somatic experiencing , this is called uncoupling as he mourned his father 's death and dealt with his guilt and shame , it took a while because jim felt he did n't deserve to feel better after jim could experience some degree of pleasure in his memories about his music , he realized that what was missing in his life his music as he remembered that his father had high blood pressure and he was n't following the diet that the doctor prescribed for him , jim realized that he was n't to blame for his father 's death and he no longer felt he had to punish himself gradually , jim started to recapture that lost part of himself the passion he felt for his music although he had no illusions that he would become famous , after many years , he picked up his guitar , which was hidden away in the basement jim described the combination of emotional pain and joy that he felt as he began strumming awkwardly on his guitar but he also said he felt an emotion that was hard to describe as if he was more integrated and whole after a while , jim found a few men his age who shared his passion for music and they jammed together for fun as they played together , jim felt a joy similar to how he once felt reclaiming a lost part of yourself talking in therapy often is n't enough unfortunately , jim 's experience of disavowing an important part of himself is common but , unlike jim , many people live the rest of their lives without recapturing that part many people never realize what 's missing and live out the rest of their lives with the sad feeling that they 're not complete often , just talking about it in therapy is n't enough because it remains an intellectual experience more often than not , a mind body approach , like somatic experiencing , allows therapy clients to experience what they 're unable to experience by just talking getting help if jim 's experience resonates with you , without even realizing it , you have also disavowed an important part of yourself that remains lost to you at this point getting help to reclaiming a lost part of yourself but you 're not alone many therapy
