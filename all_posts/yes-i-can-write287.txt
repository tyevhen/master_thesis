today has been a bit strange , or at least the latter half of it has been i'm swirling full of deep emotions , deep thoughts everything has seemed strangely full of meaning , and each new thing i saw while i was out before would start a new eddy of confused thoughts and in case you were wondering , all of this was entirely without the use of illegal substances i started writing this while i was out before , sitting in the car while my mum went inside to buy something at a store , just looking around and thinking the rain snow mix that has been falling off and on all day has paused for now , and the street that winds along the shoreline is covered in water warm yellow streetlights turn the puddles that litter the broken old pavement into tiny golden pools , that shimmer invitingly as we drew away in the car though , everything seemed to be less pretty than i 'd first thought , the puddles on the street reflecting brief flashes of light , gold from the streetlamps , white blue and red from car lights , cluttered and bright the sidewalks looked worn out , and pipes and gravel were heaped on them where they 're doing construction work i sat in gloom , brought on by me overreacting to being interrupted while i was writing i hate being interrupted while i'm writing , until we arrived at the library , where i ran into a childhood friend whom i have n't seen in years we talked for a while she 's , starting university soon , living on her own , and doing pretty good when i said goodbye and we drove off , though , memories just kept spinning through my head us dancing through the streets barefoot in long skirts , pretending we were pioneers i was absolutely obsessed with pioneers for quite a while when i was young , the tea parties we 'd have , with the tea being made from various herbs we gathered from her mothers garden , thrown into random combination 's that somehow always managed to be drinkable i just could n't help thinking how fast time passes so we drove in the dark , the streetlights making yellow blurs as we passed , a bus making a considerably larger blueish blur as it passed , looking strangely surreal talking with mom about old memories while everything just kept going strangely surreal and full of meaning , sadness happiness loss uncertainty confusion optimism that 's the best description i can give while i just tried to make sense of all the thoughts , all the emotions i could n't fully grasp it 's been a strange day , yet between those strange bits , it 's also been utterly normal i had many perfectly normal , everyday , thoughts and feelings , some perfectly normal conversations , and i came home and watched a perfectly normal show there 's just been this kind of overshadowing of deeper things like i said , i'm in a strange mood tonight peace , idzie you might also like gaspe , the old house , memories from my childhood this year in life including dogs , trips , zines and grown unschooler anna j cook the experience of trips and ukuleles and anarchists , oh my ! linkwithin
