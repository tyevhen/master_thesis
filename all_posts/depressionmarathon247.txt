i just came in from a run walk yes i ran yesterday and today it was my first time out since my hip surgery october st specifically , i ran for minutes and walked for minute for a total of miles yesterday and miles today both days were crisp and gray , and the cold air felt good on my face and in my lungs my gray mood had kept me inside for the previous days it was a relief to get out the door , and even more of a relief to put one foot in front of the other down the street my depression symptoms are still hanging around some moments feel better than others i think i'm beginning to feel a little better but my thinking is still dark and even , at times , a little paranoid it 's depression my brain only lets such thoughts seep out when the darkness has set in like i said , some moments are lighter lately i'm still making it to work adding exercise to work means i actually got two things accomplished yesterday ! it 's a beginning in other news , and possibly related to my depression symptoms , i was just diagnosed with mild sleep apnea basically , i stop breathing multiple times each night my sleep is disrupted every time i stop breathing , which may explain some of my fatigue fortunately , it 's treatable fatigue has always been a part of my depression the worse my symptoms get , the more tired i get my psychiatrist is very hopeful that beginning c pap therapy wearing a breathing mask at night , which i began a couple of days ago , will put an end to my fatigue that would be incredible i ca n't imagine my life without fatigue i appreciate all of your supportive comments lately you guys really hold me up when i'm feeling down i write this blog in hopes of helping others , but at times like this , it turns out i'm the one being helped i'm so grateful thank you thank you thank you
