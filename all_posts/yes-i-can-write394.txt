first off , woo hoo ! this post marks my th post for this blog it seems just yesterday that i reached the post mark ! secondly , i just read a blog post that states that today is blog for choice day now , i do n't want to blog on the official topic what is your top pro choice hope for president obama and or the new congress ? , but i figured i would blog about my opinions on the issue i am pro choice most definitely if a woman is raped , or even if birth control fails , and she gets pregnant , she has every right to choose whether or not she actually has the baby not just for the mother 's sake , but also for the baby i do n't think this world needs any more unwanted children that said , i do n't think abortion should be used as a method of birth control either birth control was invented for a reason , and should be used ! oh , and i also have a problem with the term pro life i saw a video i really liked on pro choice stuff , and i really like that he commented that to be truly pro life , you also need to be anti war and vegetarian i 'd add to that , and say to be truly pro life , you ca n't own a computer who 's manufacture causes women in thailand to die of cancer , or use paper products which kill forests and all those who dwell in them , including non humans and indigenous peoples , or do any one of the nearly endless list of things we do in this culture that causes death say you 're anti abortion , but saying pro life really does n't work , in my opinion in other news , i looked up tons of stuff on travel today i still have the tourist sites up for ireland , scotland , england , italy , greece , and france i also ordered travel guides for british columbia , nova scotia , new brunswick , newfoundland , yukon , and new mexico now i have to wait excitedly until they arrive in the mail ! d i have n't really posted pictures on this blog in a while , although i have been updating my photo blog pretty regularly , so i 'll post a few that i took today our lovely old flora , aka foo foo , aka flora bean beautiful minni , aka minnikins , aka minni minou sweet henry , aka hempers , aka hempsicord , aka henny the wood stove , burning brightly lovable winston , aka boo boo , aka winduffy , aka winduffers , aka windy yes , i take too many pictures of my minnikins , but i ca n't help myself ! and by the way , i'm keeping track sort of of the things i'm doing this week , so on monday i should have a week in the life of an unschooler post up ! peace , idzie
