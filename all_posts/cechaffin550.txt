yesterday was pretty damn bad i was fragile and frightened , almost unable to make any decisions nevertheless i drove kathleen to work at am , went online at a coffee shop in order to download updates , washed the car and vacuumed inside , picked up a fuse for my amplifier and bought a pair of used overalls at the car parts store , made sun tea , did the dishes , fussed around the garden , picked kathleen up from work , went shopping with her choosing types of bread was pretty overwhelming , renewed a book at the library and returned two others , prepared and mailed off child support documents to have my false arrears reduced by , and sent two more essays off to a print journal that just took one afterwards watched part of the all star game at my neighbor 's , interspersed with the movie , playing god , which diverted me we do n't have tv and we need one for my mental health these do n't quite sound like the activities of a depressed person , do they ? but that 's the point no one knows unless i tell them just like a light skinned black in the s , i'm passing but if my thought dreams could be seen , they 'd probably put my head in a guillotine dylan i am an alien but i look human i come from the land of deep darkness where shadows pass for light the tail of my whirlpool has no end , it just gets smaller and smaller my cells are dying as i speak i am death walking i am a mannequin propelled by tears but i pass one thing i do is to avoid eye contact i find that extremely daunting i do n't want anyone to look in my eyes and vice versa the eye is the window to the soul , quoth jesus i wo n't commit suicide no matter how many people despise this blog because they could n't despise it more than i do abjectly , ce
