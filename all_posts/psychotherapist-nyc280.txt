i recently watched the movie , nicky 's family , for the second time within the last year , and i enjoyed it even more the second time than the first czechoslovakia the country where over children were saved by nicholas winton in case you have n't seen this wonderful documentary yet , i highly recommend that you see it it 's now available on netflix and amazon , especially if you like inspiring and uplifting movies nicky 's family is a documentary by natej minac about nicholas winton , currently years old , who saved the lives of over jewish children in nazi occupied czechoslovakia by arranging to transport them from their country to loving homes in england this was an immense undertaking during that time , before there were computers and before the internet he met with the parents , who made the tremendous sacrifice of giving up their children , realizing that , in all likelihood , they would never see them again but these parents also knew that allowing nicholas winton to find their children new homes in england was the only way that their children would survive it 's hard to imagine how devastatingly painful it must have been for the parents of these children to let them go to say nothing of how frightening it had to be for these children to be transported by train to a country completely unknown to them these children , who now have grandchildren , would have certainly been killed in nazi concentration camps during world war ii if it were not for the dedicated work of nicholas winton , who worked against formidable odds to save their lives after the war , mr winton now sir winton modestly kept quiet about his work until his wife discovered the book that he kept with all of the names , pictures and records of the british adoptions for these children in , he was honored on the bbc show , that 's life , where he got to meet the people that he saved in the audience this is one of many poignant moments in the film and his modesty , so emblematic of people in the s , is deeply moving and refreshing the documentary is narrated by canadian journalist , joe schlesinger , who was also one of the children that was saved by nicholas winton a child today in the czech republic not only do we hear the personal stories of their lives from these individuals who were saved , we also get to meet their children and grandchildren , many of whom , inspired by winton , have gone on to do their own devoted work for children all around the world we hear the word hero a lot these days nicholas winton is a hero in every sense of the word and deserves the recognition that he is finally getting after so many years this is a heart warming true story that will lift your spirits about me i am a nyc psychotherapist , hypnotherapist , emdr and somatic experiencing therapist who works with individual adults and couples to find out more about me , visit my website josephine ferraro , lcsw nyc psychotherapist to set up a consultation , call me at or email me
