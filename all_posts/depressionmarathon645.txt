i 've had a successfully productive weekend it started at am yesterday morning with my mile long run as i predicted , it went well i did hit the wall at mile , but until then the hours clicked by relatively quickly it was a bit steamy outside i was soaking wet even my shoes were soaked from the sweat running down my legs they squished with every step regardless , i tolerated the humidity and ran well it was a good training run today i hit the pool and cleaned up my yard puck woke me at am , even though i had planned to sleep in i swam for minutes it felt good to stretch out in the pool then i mowed my yard and pulled weeds for what felt like hours ! i had monster weeds growing up through the cracks in my sidewalk i'm still trying to clean the dirt out from under my nails ! at least my house looks presentable from the curb now my mood has been good , but i'm a little anxious today i actually had to take a prn medication to calm down i 've been thinking and worrying about next weekend , which i will be spending with my new friend d we 've got a long weekend scheduled , and i'm excited to see him i'm trying to stay in the moment now and stop the worry thoughts i think it 's going to be a long week leading up to the weekend i 'll have to really work hard to take one day at a time wish me luck
