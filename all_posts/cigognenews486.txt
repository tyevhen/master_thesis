hello , dr france janov has been working on a legacy project for several years the art and science of primal therapy it has many videos of our training and sessions showing how we work this is a transcript of a one training session about attention deficit disorder add that i thought we should show you because it has so many insights aj origins of add and leaky gates by dr arthur janov transcribed by frank robinette introduction this is a discussion about the effects of add , what causes it , what drives it , the cause and effect of leaky gates , feelings of failure , panic , procrastination , and how a person copes with it also discussed are the effects of primal therapy on those who present with add the conversation begins with dr arthur janov dr aj introducing david who reads a segment from dr aj s blog , janov s reflections published on december , i would let this go , except that last night there was a one hour special on pbs about add , with four major specialists in the subject the diagnoses they came up with is what i think is the problem with the whole field of psychotherapy , psychology and psychiatry not once in the hour did i hear what the origins of add might be and why it occurs most of the time , it was spelling out how to cope with it so we also might add how to deal with phobias , obsessions , migraines , high blood pressure and on and on it is tantamount to saying that the illnesses stay but how we deal with them changes it is all about our attitude so you still have the allergies and you avoid this and that to cope with your allergy or you have a chaotic mind , try to avoid clutter the first point they made is that diagnosis is essential and they list ten things that make you an adder you need to be impulsive , not able to focus and concentrate , unable to pay attention , hyperactive , unable to sit still i am adding here , low self esteem , learning disorders , can t listen , needs to talk constantly , cannot wait , no long term goals , lose temper easily , act without thinking , very impatient , a bad memory , an underachiever , etc i added here some from a list of the brown scale for add it pretty well covers it but you have to be suffering from this for six months or more , they claim what the experts concluded was that a diagnosis was critical once you are aware , they claim , you are half way there , because you know what to do which includes making future plans , making your environment work for you , find a calm partner and a job that suits you , making an effort not to lose patience , and above all , they claim that the therapy for this is success once you have a success you can build on it and you will have a higher self esteem and won t be an underachiever so let me see you tell the doctor that you are impulsive , impatient , cannot wait , cannot concentrate nor sit still , and she says to you that you have add ok there is the diagnosis , now what ? she has told you what you just told her in more simple terms have we made progress ? is that what a diagnosis is ? saying things in esoteric language ? the doctors have then many suggestions don t do too many chores at once , stay in a calm environment , jog to work off tension but do not over talk don t work amid chaos i say to the doctor that i cannot stand crowded restaurants and he tells me to avoid them and he adds do not take so many risks in your life , yet he adds it is the risk takers who invent and innovate and tend to be more creative now i am confused not once did i hear in one hour the word , why ? where does it come from and what i can i do about it what is the generating source of all that ? so now you will read my opinion about it it is an educated opinion since i have treated many cases what happens is that cognitive behavioral approaches have taken hold so that the psychiatric diagnostic manual indicates all these behaviors , and it is assumed that to treat it all , we need to change behaviors , hence , behavioral therapy let s go back to womb life there is a good deal of evidence that a mother s hyperactivity , the drugs she takes , such as cocaine can leave an imprint or a residue that affects the offspring for a lifetime if the mother is hyper the child may also be just that can set up a child who is revved up from the start an israeli study found that the children of holocaust survivors , very anxious people gave birth to anxious children at first they thought it was because the parents told horrible stories to the children but then they discovered that the anxiety came down through the genetic chain that is , it was descended from the mother s physiology epigenetics laura spinney , , dec internet then there is the trauma of birth and infancy where the child may be left for days without warm cuddling and then harsh parents who fill the child with feelings of rejection and abandonment all this sets up imprints down low in the neuraxis this is then transmitted to higher centers as they develop and evolve where the child is filled with input from inside that frazzles his brain that feeds constant and varied input to the neo cortex , no different from listening to ten people at once all talking at you except , except that this information is constant from inside not outside it competes with stimuli from outside but it all gets to be too much it is paying attention to too much input which is normal , not an aberration the disease , if it exists at all , is stimulating information that floods the cortex with electrical input just the same as being flooded with shock therapy of course , he is hyperactive , he is being prodded all of the time from below so that any new input is overwhelming and he starts to crumble he cannot manage complex instructions you go to the right two blocks and then one block to the left and then go straight to the roundabout and then we have already lost him because the internal input is crowding out the information and of course , he cannot sit still because there is information that needs connection and resolution , the integration that cannot happen so long as he has no access to his early imprinted memories the information is constantly climbing upwards and forwards for that connection so that the system can function better and then he cannot get down to things , quickly start a paper , a project or an article because there is so much going on in his brain for him to focus on just one thing so others get impatient because he did not turn in his paper on time he was so busy , doing this or that , as his moods dictate because he is being twisted and turned here and there internally with little cerebral control
