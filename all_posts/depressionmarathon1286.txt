i love rollercoasters love them but not when they snatch me up so quickly , before i know it i am hurling down a spiral track into a heavy , swirling morass here i am trying to scream snatched up twisting down lightning quick no warning no inkling of what lies ahead will i keep spiraling down ? will there be a bottom ? or will this be a mere divot , as i am swiftly turned , again , and head back up ?
