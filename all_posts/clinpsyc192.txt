earlier in the week , i noted that a much ballyhooed study purporting to show a relationship between an increase in youth suicide and a decrease in ssri prescriptions for youth actually did no such thing here 's what the media are saying about the study warning if you do n't want to be shocked by examples of terribly poor journalism , please do not read the remainder of the post from the esteemed british medical journal numbers of suicides among americans aged under years rose by from to , the study says , the biggest annual increase since systematic recording began in the same year saw a decrease in the number of ssri prescriptions to this age group the increase in suicide rates appears to be accurate as i pointed out earlier , the youth suicide rate then apparently dropped slightly in , which is when ssri prescriptions for youth fell steeply as for ssri prescriptions dropping that number is inaccurate look at the chart pardon the crappy image quality and note that the ssri prescription rate for youth in the u s was down only slightly in , not by bad journalism from the washington post the trend lines do not prove that suicides rose because of the drop in prescriptions , but gibbons , insel and other experts said the international evidence leaves few other plausible explanations again , if you folks want to rely solely on correlational data which is a stupid idea in any case , then you may want to make sure that a statistical analysis is actually run which shows a relationship between ssri prescriptions and suicide rates read the whole wapo piece if you 'd like it 's not terrible overall from webmd warnings that antidepressants may increase teen suicides appear to have backfired , a new study suggests the fda has overestimated the effect of antidepressant medications on suicidality and dramatically underestimated the efficacy of antidepressants in the treatment of childhood depression , gibbons told webmd in april oh , he must be referring to the efficacy that shows , at best , a small effect over placebo indeed , the recent meta analysis by bridge and colleagues that claims it showed the benefits outweighed the risks for ssris even showed a very small treatment effect favoring ssris in depression for youth indeed , most ssris did not show any advantage over placebo how does one dramatically underestimate a treatment that provides an apparently pretty small benefit over placebo ? and if you really love to rely on correlational , epidemiological data , then try this on for size the data do not indicate that ssris decrease suicide how about the chicago tribune ? suicide rates for preteens and teenagers increased sharply when the food and drug administration slapped a black box warning on anti depressants and doctors started writing fewer prescriptions for young people , according to federal data released thursday this one will be covered in a moment the headline in the san francisco chronicle suicide rise follows antidepressant drop study finds dramatic increase after 'black box' warning as i noted earlier , the black box warning occurred in october , and i know of not one shred of data that can track that particular time point to a dramatic increase in suicides hell , gibbons and colleagues did not even attempt to link an increase in suicides to that particular date , yet the media latch onto this point as if it is mired in solid scientific data and one more from the los angeles times the study , which includes data from the netherlands , provides the strongest evidence yet that the drugs are useful in preventing suicide , gibbons said so , to make this clear , the strongest evidence yet is based upon a report of correlational data where , for the main population studied the united states , there was not even a single statistical analysis done to relate a decrease in ssri prescriptions with an increase in suicide rate ? this , my friends , is bad science that has now become the truth thanks to science writers who either do n't know a damn thing about science or are unwilling to challenge the opinions of the scientists whom they interview it also becomes the truth when gibbons , in interviews , is making statements that run far past what his own data show scientists can have opinions , but one needs to separate what is based on solid data from what is speculation by all means , read my prior post that dissects this latest study and let me know if i missed something in my opinion , the gibbons study was uninformative at best and appears to have led to a large number of poorly reported stories at this point , a few bright individuals appear to have indicated that my take on the article is accurate , , to be fair , the boston globe and new york times get a pass their coverage of the issue was excellent for a great brief read on another youth suicide study , visit the last psychiatrist update via furious seasons an op ed in the boston globe by alison bass blasts the latest media blitz regarding the alleged link between declining ssri prescriptions and increased suicides furious seasons wisely notes a couple of small errors in the globe piece , but the overall thrust is well worth a read
