i started writing a story last year about a person who is handicapped that goes shopping at a warehouse club i tried to incorporate some of my experiences and also included my thoughts on what it is like navigating through these monster warehouses pushing a cart i gave up walking through these clubs a few years ago the concrete wears me down too quickly using the club s scooters are okay , but they are not fast enough i might die of old age before getting from the entrance to the frozen food section my wheelchair makes the experience more tolerable i just finished the rewrite yesterday for my post today i am providing the link to this story if you are interested living and dying at the sam s club i hope you enjoy it as much as i enjoyed writing about the experience if it gave you a few chuckles , let me know
