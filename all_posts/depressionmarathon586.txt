it 's the end of another long , inpatient weekend thankfully , we at least had football to watch both saturday and today other than that distraction , and a visit from puck yesterday , it 's been another long , boring weekend here puck is now staying at the home of my sponsor , as friends bill and cindy went on their own two week vacation he seems to be no worse for my absence , but i worry about him and miss him terribly tomorrow i will have ect treatment number it looks like we are going to do the full course of treatments , which means i'm here until next weekend we changed up some of the parameters for ect treatment number on friday , and i am finally beginning to feel better yesterday , despite being long and boring , my mood was probably the best it 's been since i arrived here weeks ago i'm more hopeful now that the final treatments will knock the depression back for good i'm worried about finances i' 've been off work since december st that 's almost weeks without a paycheck i'm not sure how that will work itself out , but i have to believe that it will and when i return to work , it will be at about half the time i was working before this treatment episode thankfully , my boss is willing to work with me and has been flexible with my return i'm grateful for that i do n't want to jump back in too soon , but i 've got to pay my bills i'm praying for a positive week ahead i'm not looking forward to being inside for another days , but if the next three ect treatments have the impact of the last one , things will be good wish me luck
