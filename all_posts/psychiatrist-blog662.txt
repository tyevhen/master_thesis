one option was to let the day pass without a blog post the other was to say something about the fact that it 's september th , a day that left so many people so distressed it was never an option to post on an unrelated topic i find myself pushing thoughts of that day out of my head , and then , periodically , i'm drawn to watching a youtube video of the towers falling mostly , though , i 've had nothing to say because what is there left to say ? it was horrible my patients have not been talking about they all want to tell me where they were during the earthquake that shook us a few weeks ago , and whether they lost power during hurricane irene i 'd asked a former guest blogger who lives in nyc if he wanted to write about , and he said he 'd think about it and i have n't heard back another friend was standing under the towers when they collapsed i asked if he 'd like to write for a psychiatry blog and he said he 'd been unable to write about it , perhaps in his memoir , and last year he left the country on the day this was a tragedy that evades words and pulls us to places that are difficult to go i want to thank david hellerstein , again , for writing a guest post for us on resilience in honor of the anniversary when i first read his post , i liked it , but i thought it was about resiliency , and not the aftermath of the terrorist attacks perhaps that is truly the best place to go as we all carry on with hope in our hearts and finally , i 'd like to link to a memorial note for for my friend , carlos dacosta peace to all
