it 's been a whole week since i last blogged ! how horrible ! but seriously , the reason i have n't blogged this past week is that i had a guest ty , my wonderful friend and now boyfriend came to visit ! the first night , nick joined my sister , ty , and i and we all walked to the water even though it was grey , it was still beautiful nick , just watching the water i just love this photo of emi nick found some of the first buds of the season ! ty took pictures nick poked moss ty took pictures of his reflection in a ditch nick stared at the sky in fascination ? my lovely sister curls ! ty has gorgeous curls nick and ty played chicken when nick stayed for supper , he decided to turn his falafel into a smiley face i just love nick p i must say i'm rather envious of ty 's nikon d trev was happy to oblige when ty asked him to braid his hair and i was happy to help ! a hair braiding train p i liked the braids that is one cool belt and one cool purple hoodie sorry , i just felt a need to emphasize the fact that the hoodie is purple p close up braid shot trev and i greatly enjoyed braiding in beads p cutest pic ever ! trev and ty watching a funny video on my computer the last day he was here , ty , who 's apprenticing with a magician , did a few card tricks for us he 's good ! i must watch him do more card tricks and figure out how they 're done the time he was here was great ! we spent tons of time just chilling and talking we hung out with emi , trev , and nick , who even slept over one night ! there were lots of people piles , lots of cuddling , and i was really sad to see ty go but i'm going to be seeing him next month , and that makes me happy ! if i was less tired , i 'd write a longer , more involved post , but i have n't slept much this past week , what with staying up really late at night and getting woken up too early the next morning by a certain someone cough ty cough plus , we rented slumdog millionaire , so i'm going to go watch that now peace , idzie
