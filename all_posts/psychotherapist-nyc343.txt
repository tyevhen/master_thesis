we 've all heard about how important it is to set goals in order to have the life that you want but for many people goal setting remains a mystery they 're not sure where to start so , in this article , i'm focusing on the first stage of goal setting , which is creating a vision of what you want achieving your goals using the mind body connection to create a vision of what you want goal setting creating a vision of what you want in order to set goals for yourself , you need to know what you want although this sounds logical , for many people , this is a big stumbling block because they do n't know what they want in many ways , the initial stage of goal setting , creating a vision , can be the most fun stage by relaxing and using your imagination , you can begin to create a vision for yourself that will help you to realize what you want achieving your goals using the mind body connection to create a vision of what you want during the early s , i read a book by shakti gawain called creative visualization use the power of your imagination to create what you want in life in this book , ms gawain outlines how you can use , among other things , mental imagery to free up your imagination so you can create visualizations as the starting point of your goal setting process i would recommend this book as a start if you 're having a problem at the initial stage of goal setting i recommend , at this stage , that people just allow themselves the freedom to visualize whatever their imagination comes up with without censoring themselves allow yourself to dream and play with ideas later on , you can get more specific but at this stage it 's important to allow yourself to play with the images that come up without judging them goal setting concretizing the images and using your vision as a road map to achieve your goals the next stage would be to write down the images or ideas that come to you it 's important to capture your images and ideas and to concretize them in some way whether this means writing down a list or , if you want to take more time and be creative , drawing or making collages that are symbolic of what you want achieving your goals creating a road map symbols can be powerful representations that help to stimulate your imagination even more and also help you to develop other ideas whichever way you choose to concretize what comes up in your imagination , capturing it in a concrete way , on the most basic level , helps you to remember it rather than allowing it to slip away like a puff of smoke it also helps to reinforce whatever comes up and helps you to create a road map to follow to achieve your goals goal setting clinical hypnosis and somatic experiencing for many people , who try to use their imagination to create a vision of what they want , nothing comes no matter how hard they try , their minds remain blank and all they see when they close their eyes is , well , nothing initially , when i first tried to do visualizations many years ago , i also got nothing i had friends who had wonderful , very detailed technicolor visualizations i was happy for them , but i also wished that i could do more than draw a blank when i
