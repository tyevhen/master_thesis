the question of agency in psychiatry is an interesting one to me , it 's clear i'm the agent of my patient , it 's his best interest that i care about but the odd thing is that society periodically asks me to assess patients for their interests is my patient able to serve on jury duty ? he tells me he 's very anxious , in fact he 's taking medications for anxiety , and he has some health issues , and everything about jury duty is hard here in the grand city of baltimore there 's a daily stipend it does n't cover the parking fee you have to negotiate downtown traffic , park in a garage , walk to the courthouse , and if you 're put on a criminal trial , there is the fear albeit the risk is perhaps quite small that you or your family could be in danger if you vote to convict a gang member the seats in the waiting room are uncomfortable , the temperature is always wrong either way too hot or way too cold serving does n't mean you 'll ever be called to a court room , i 've spent hours in a freezing waiting room to then be dismissed at the end of the day okay , but here it 's not the court asking , it 's the patient asking but the point is that if i say someone ca n't serve , they get a free pass what about driving ? periodically , someone gives me a form to fill out for dmv regarding their safety to drive because they carry a psychiatric diagnosis i'm not aware of any purely psychiatric diagnosis with the exception of dementia which leaves one unable to drive , and invariably the patients does wish to continue driving driving helps get to appointments and to obtain medications and food , among other things usually it 's people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder who show up with the forms i have never witnessed any of my patients drive if i did , i still would n't know how to judge driver safety assessment is not taught in medical school and many patients talk about having multiple accidents , unrelated to any diagnosis or substance issue they 're just lousy drivers and they never show up with forms a difficult one is the people who show up with forms for clearance for a new job if they are bringing me a form , it means they 've told the employer or the human resource folks that they have a diagnosis often , it 's my opinion that it would be in their best interest to at least try working work adds structure and meaning to a life , it often adds health insurance a very good thing , and it adds money which allows for food , housing , medications , entertainment , and opportunities for fun , all of which improve mental health ! sometimes , however , i'm not sure if my patient will be able to do the job like driving , i was not trained to assess the ability to work sometimes i can see there might be problems the patient misses appointments because they get too depressed to get up , or they have executive functioning issues where they simply do n't organize their lives well oops , i forgot i scheduled appointments at the same time ! but still , if they want to work , and if they can , it would be in their best interest now , obviously , there are some exceptions here where it 's not in my patient 's best interest to take a job for example if there 's been a history of repeated suicide attempts or violent behaviors , then perhaps it does n't make sense for me to clear a patient for a job if it requires that he carry a firearm but mostly , it 's more benign stuff and i 've seen people who ca n't get to an appointment reliably , but can manage a job either they prioritize getting to work , or they have jobs that value performance more than punctuality and many people negotiate successful work lives around substance abuse problems , especially if they can limit the substances to after hours and there , too , there is a check on the system that does n't fall on me jobs where sobriety is crucial usually include drug screening so what 's my obligation here ? the patient the wants the job no one 's life will be in danger if she fails , though with some people , job failure can be a huge emotional setback the structure , purpose , and money will all be be good if the patient can manage to work but there are these forms that i 've been handed with a long check list of questions regarding the ability to perform tasks where i have no idea , or i suspect that , based on history , the patient may not be able to do like show up , attend to detail , demonstrate organized thinking but i could be wrong , because i have been before , and a work setting is different from a psychiatric office if i say i do n't think the patient can perform , they do n't get the job and they lose the chance to try in my head , it 's a dilemma there is no question that i am the agent of the patient and that i owe nothing to a patient 's potential employer with whom i have no relationship just because they send a packet of papers i want what 's best for my patient , but as human being , if i have reason to believe the patient ca n't perform a task and i say they can , then i'm basically lying none of it feels right psychiatrists and perhaps doctors as a whole have ended up in these strange places we often do n't know if our patients can work , serve on a jury , drive , own a firearm safely , go to summer camp , or manage the stress of any given situation new settings can be stabilizing or destabilizing i'm not sure how we got to be the gatekeepers on such things your thoughts ? so when i'm
