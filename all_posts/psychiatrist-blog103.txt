today is october , , and the day set for the long awaited change in the system used to code medical and surgical diagnoses say good bye to the , ways that the international classification of diseases let you be sick or injured , and now we have , new ways for all those events in psychiatry , it should n't be too bad , and i'm planning to spend my day in the office updating my computer the psychiatry blogger psychpractice was kind enough to make a cross over chart , and i'm hoping that will be helpful if it might be helpful to you , here is the link http psychpracticemd blogspot com p blog page html for others , it may not be such an easy day if you 're having angioplasty today , yesterday your doctor had a choice of one code today , she has options , so do be patient with her , it 's a big menu to choose from there were jokes on twitter about codes that would differentiate between being bitten by a duck in a thong or being bitten by a duck while wearing a thong here at shrink rap , where the duck has been our long time mascot , we do n't think that 's at all funny if you 'd like a sample of some of the new codes , however , there is something for everyone for the creative types y d activity , knitting and crocheting for the more active souls v xa burn due to water skis on fire , initial encounter for those who can be a bit klutzy t d asphyxiation due to being trapped in a discarded refrigerator , accidental i could n't find the code if someone was trapped in a refrigerator that had n't been discarded and for those who are just really unlucky vxa spacecraft crash injuring occupant the codes can be very specific s a insect bite nonvenomous of anus , initial encounter and we do n't want clinkshrink to feel left out , so there is y swimming pool of prison as the place of injury and i imagine clinkshrink will certainly be spending her day checking on the safety features of all those swimming pools in the correctional system here in maryland finally , there really are duck related injury codes and they are kind enough to differentiate whether the patient is struck by a duck wxa or bitten by a duck wxa i suggest that you not do anything to provoke the duck
