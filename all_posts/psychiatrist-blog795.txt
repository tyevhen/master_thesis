sometimes , i treat people who have the same problems i have in my personal life it 's hard oh , it 's really hard if i'm really distraught about something and a patient calls seeking treatment with a similar life circumstance , i will sometimes turn them away and recommend another shrink but i do n't always screen so carefully on the phone , and often i 'd like to make an appointment , will simply get a time and date the feelings get really complicated here if i feel i 've had a role in creating my circumstances , then i wonder as my patients seek my counsel , who am i to be making any suggestions , much less giving advice ? why are you looking to me , i 've screwed up the same situations oh , you say , dr jeff said on kevinmd that psychiatrist 's should n't give advice , but you know , some of us do , and even when we do n't , our feelings are often relayed through the questions we ask or the comments we make or do n't make , or perhaps by the expressions on our faces , even if we do n't say you should do x i told a friend once that i feel uneasy , guilty even , in these situations , and he replied , how do you think i feel ? did i mention he does family work and was in the midst of a stressful divorce ? and i have yet to ask a colleague who also does family work how he managed during the years his own children would n't speak to him oy , life can be tough , for shrinks just like everyone else so perhaps i listen to someone talking about his most personal feelings about a situation , and you know , if i 've been there before , perhaps it 's good that i can empathize if i'm in the middle of it , sometimes i listen and the patient 's words seem so unreasonable , so unjustified , and yet i recognize them as being exactly my own it 's like having my own anxieties bounced off a wall only to ricochet straight back into my face do i tell the patient that i 've been in the same place before ? generally , no therapy is about his problems , not mine , and i think in these situations my empathy is clear i say things that are more poignant and resonant than i might in circumstances where i feel removed and patients never ask if i 've been in the exact same place on some of the harder things things that have no precise quick and easy answer i 've taken to saying , not only do n't i know what will fix this , i do n't know anyone else who does have the answer this i can say because i 've done my own searching i hope i'm reassuring and comforting to people who find themselves in the same places i dwell certainly , tripping over a few stones on the path makes one walk a little more gingerly and judge a little less harshly those who walk more slowly mostly , though , i worry that i'm a little bit of a fraud just for being in the room
