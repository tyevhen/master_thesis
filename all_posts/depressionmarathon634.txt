the good news is my left calf did not hurt one bit during saturday 's marathon it was absolutely fine the rest , painful massages , epsom salt ice baths , stretching , and prayers must have worked , for i did n't even feel a twinge of discomfort unfortunately , there is bad news as well despite the lack of expected calf pain , i did not finish the marathon for only the third time in my life , i dropped out of a race dnf did not finish are three letters i do n't like to see following my name in any race result , but saturday just was n't my day i have no other explanation than that i felt great on friday i ate well , hydrated , and rested appropriately the weather was nearly perfect saturday morning i felt ready and had only the typical nervous anticipation prior to the start but i think that 's where the normalcy ended shortly after the gun went off , i had an inkling something was n't quite right perhaps i started a bit too fast although my pace was nearly the same as i ran at grandma 's marathon just two months ago , i could n't catch my breath i chalked it up to nervousness and tried to distract myself with some gratitude prayers at each mile , throughout the mile , i thanked god for a different person in my life the distraction worked until mile when our flat course suddenly became gigantically hilly it was a course change i had n't expected my quick pace bit me in the ass for the next three miles we summitted hills , each one longer and steeper than the last i hung in there up and over the first three hills , but by hill number four i was in distress first of all , my gi system was off , which forced an emergent bathroom stop then the lengthy fourth hill slowed me to a walk half way from the top the steep descent on the other side must have torn me up , too , because by the time our path flattened around mile , my legs were trashed the hills were done , and so , i feared , was i it was more than just my legs giving way my shortness of breath , which the hills exacerbated , never ceased and my energy all but disappeared i felt cooked , and i was only at mile ! dismayed , i tried to soldier on i walked at mile markers i joined up with other runners in hopes they would pull me along i walked through water stops i waited for the bad spot to pass but saturday , for whatever reason , the bad spot only worsened despite my pride in perseverance , stubbornness , and personal pep talks , my body just would n't go i ran and walked from miles through while still maintaining a reasonable pace but after mile , in which i walked more than i ran , i finally gave up i was n't having fun i knew if i continued it would be a really long day so one hour and fifty five minutes into the race , at exactly mile , i dropped out i was disappointed nearly to tears , but it was the right decision and knowing that kept my chin up i caught a ride to the finish where d was waiting , first with surprise and then with a hug my day was done this was a small blip of disappointment in an otherwise excellent weekend believe it or not , while i know i could have finished , i'm proud of myself for making what was probably the wiser decision my focus now is on recovering , resting , and preparing better for october after all , the twin cities marathon is only weeks away
