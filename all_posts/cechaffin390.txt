as i was blogging yesterday i came to a space to pray it may have been inspired by that gaelic prayer anonymous posted in yesterday 's comments but as soon as i tried to pray i began to weep as i 've said , faith is a sore point with me so i tried to jot the experience down , resulting in this raw poem below half belief thank you for this disease , o lord , that has ravaged my life like a bulldozer making and destroying mountains , or a savage volcano destroying the very mountain it was in a cutting rage of lava thank you for the humility of never knowing how i will be whether low as a nematode or the radiant king of the universe , your chosen one i only wish the uncertainty of these shifting states didn t undermine my belief in the future , my ability to plan i am a homeless soul , a faithless soul what i build i don t believe in what i lose i never deserved what i love will be taken from me but faith declares i should praise you it feels unnatural , but isn t that the point ? as a new creation in christ what was unnatural before should be natural now little did i know how hard it would be to live out this religion when i was young bursting with adrenaline , hypomanic without knowledge of it , it seemed easy but i fear i was a fake buoyed up by feelings , by the steam of my imagination past the middle of my life now how would i know if my prayer were genuine ? the half belief my sickness grants me is no belief you may disregard this prayer or not i ca n't even begin to describe the depth of grief that fills me upon any attempt to practice christianity i still believe that it 's true , but it 's toxic to me it has always been toxic to me in depressions , sometimes even in manias , when i felt specially chosen and empowered as jesus' younger brother laugh with me on this because it is funny that a man of my intellectual capacities and strength of endurance could become a plaything for a capricious , biochemical disease is an antidote to pride , at the least , besides the obvious irony yet as a child and later on , in high school , my chief fear was losing my mind i must have known something about myself before i ever knew it my first major depression came at the age of , but naturally was dismissed as adolescent weirdness my second came at , while a foreign exchange student to germany i had a mild mania at , when i became engaged to an unsuitable mate , followed by a deep depression that i endured so as not to break my promise to the woman things just tumble on after that until the present day , though the frequency of the extreme moods has decreased with medication nevertheless , my first two major adult decisions , marriage and career , resulted from psychotic revelations i was ill suited , by temperament , to medicine as well all that time i thought it was god 's will to marry this woman , god 's will to become a doctor , and i feared not doing god 's will how sick to have the foundations of one 's life based on psychosis and fear of displeasing the almighty i suppose by way of background i want everyone to know how sick i 've been in the past , and that i'm not that bad now experience has taught me much about enduring depression , not that it dampens the pain much , but it does improve the outlook i know i 'll get better someday , i always have before so a raw confessional poem and a little history unrateable , dr chaffin
