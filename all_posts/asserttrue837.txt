yesterday , eweek interviewed me for a story , midmarket digital asset management firms disappearing the thrust of it is that there are damn few dam solutions for small to midsize businesses , specifically businesses that need a solution that 's scalable and plays well with typical smb it infrastructure , all for under k the situation is somewhat odd , given that there are tons of cms vendors in the k to k range plus open source offerings in the dam world there are n't even any serious open source contenders i think there 's an opportunity here arguably for someone to build a powerful but affordable dam application that will run atop or alongside ? an open source cms failing that , i 'd be happy if someone would just build an adobe bridge to alfresco connector
