google has introduced yet another service , called google measurement labs , designed to test your connection speed and provide various types of information about your last mile chokepoints i have read google 's own announcement about this as well as several blogs that try to explain it , and honestly , i still ca n't fathom the true motivations behind it or why the heck anyone outside of academia or perhaps the nsa would even care obviously , google has an interest in last mile problems the internet is its lifeblood , but offering this set of diagnostics to the general public gives the impression that google is very proudly answering a question nobody asked i do n't get it
