is there a bigger waste of mental energy than worrying ? i do n't think so and i know i'm wasting a ton of energy these days my relationship , my injury , and a potential surgery are the primary issues causing me concern i 've got worries i'm sorry to report my boyfriend and i are struggling a bit we 've been long distance dating for four years living four hours apart from each other has been challenging , but we 've made it work recently , however , making it work has been a little more difficult out of respect for my boyfriend 's privacy , i do n't want to say more that that we 're talking , and that 's important , but i do n't yet know what the future entails for us it 's a stressful time , and i'm worried my achilles tendon continues to cause me anxiety the pain is a constant reminder something is wrong it 's improved ever so slightly , but there is still no way i can run i had my mri last tuesday , but i do n't yet know the results that 's frustrating i'm scheduled to see my doctor for the results this wednesday not knowing what 's wrong has been tough i want to know what 's up so i can make a plan and move forward and so i can get the worries out of my brain ! battling for space in my brain is indecision and worry regarding a big decision i have to make i 've told you in the past about my sleep apnea apparently , i 've got a lot of extra tissue , including my tonsils , hanging around in my throat there is a surgery called uppp which can remove the excess tissue and potentially solve my sleep apnea that would be thrilling ! no more c pap , which i hate ! seems like an easy decision , right ? nope there are potential complications which leave me questioning what to do in addition to the normal complications , which can result from any surgery , there are two big variables to be considered uppp surgery is only successful around of the time , and uppp surgery is extremely painful the pain lasts a solid two weeks , during which time i would be unable to exercise or work that fact adds mental health and financial concerns to the decision making process after a long , frank discussion with the ear , nose and throat surgeon , i'm leaning toward doing the surgery , but i'm having trouble actually making the decision i'm not a fan of throat pain , so that scares me i'm worried about not being able to do anything for two weeks that could be tough on my mental health i'm not sure if i can afford to take two full weeks off of work when i do n't work , i do n't get paid that worries me and finally , even if i do get through all of that , there 's a chance i 'll still have sleep apnea ! i really do n't know what to do decisions , decisions i dislike indecision i dislike worrying they both sap my energy i'm trying to combat the worry , and make some decisions , with pros and cons lists , chats with friends and professionals , and writing i'm spending a lot of time refocusing my mind , trying to come back to the present moment , every time i find myself stuck with one of these concerns spinning in my head it 's difficult but necessary i know the sooner i take some steps and make some decisions , the sooner i 'll be able to quit worrying and start moving forward once again
