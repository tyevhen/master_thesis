i overreact when i'm anxious when i feel those all too familiar feelings creep in , not only am i experiencing anxiety , but i become upset that i'm anxious i start worrying about worrying ! one of the most distressing symptoms i suffer with when i'm anxious is blurred vision and a feeling of depersonalization feeling out of touch with reality i become upset about feeling this way , so i end up fueling the anxiety fire doing certain tasks makes me extremely anxious when i'm so anxious my vision becomes blurry and it 's difficult to concentrate i become upset that my vision is blurry and my mind is cloudy , and i fear these symptoms will impact my performance thus , my anxiety level continues to increase in the spirit of a new me for a new year , on monday i tried adopting a new way of thinking instead of becoming very upset about these distressing symptoms , i'm trying to remain calm the opposite of what an anxious mind screams at us to do after all , i have an anxiety disorder that 's reality , and i ca n't wish it away these uncomfortable sensations are part of this disease i'm doing what i need to do and if i make a mistake because my vision is blurred or thinking somewhat impaired , then oh well ! worrying about these symptoms certainly wo n't change the outcome and , in fact , will only make me more anxious i'm trying to take away the power anxiety has over my life by attempting to label my anxious feelings as no big deal , i'm hoping their intensity eventually will decrease this strategy seems to be working , but it 's by no means easy
