just got in from a mile run here in the mountains at feet , miles at pace feels like miles at pace it may be beautiful , but it is all work this is the third day in a row i 've gone running , which makes me feel good , but like i said , it 's tough up here the first time i went , i made it almost miles , but i thought my chest was going to explode ! yesterday , i did hill repeats of about yards each i'm not sure what got into me ! so today was a long run ha ! oh well , at least i 've been getting out there i do feel better once i'm finished i'm hoping to do a little hiking with puck today there is a nearby peak which takes about an hours to summit it 's a fairly simple hike , so puck should be okay he sure is loving it out here he 's doing very well no injuries in fact he almost seems stronger than when we first arrived i love watching him romp around freely i love hiking with him , too , so that should be fun my mood has been better the past couple days hmmm do you think the fact that i 've been running daily has anything to do with that ? we 've been very mellow and relaxed around here bill 's family has left , so it 's just the three of us and the two dogs left up here there 's been a lot of chatting , napping , laughing , eating , napping , walking , reading , and napping going on the days have been cool and sunny the nights have been clear and the stars incredible i think it 's going to be tough to go back home ! that 's all i 've got for now after all , i think it 's time for a nap ! have a peaceful day
