why change the habit of a lifetime ? i have no idea who said that , but it has certainly resonated with me over the years why indeed ? our poor brain categorises our actions as habits so that we don t end up with mental fatigue having to make constant decisions depletes our energy and it s , therefore , a welcome relief if there are habits in place to make that decision making easier but what if you really want to change a habit ? maybe it s a bad habit that makes you feel guilty or sad , or perhaps you want to create a good habit and have it stick as a regular in your life how on earth do you go about this ? i joined a gym yesterday don t panic i will not be clambering on any rowing machines or sprinting down a treadmill anytime soon i joined so that i could utilise their swimming pool and abundance of yoga and pilates classes the added bonus of a coffee shop swung the deal ! i want to create a good , healthy habit in my daily life and meet like minded people before i hit the join now button or unearthed my swimming costume from the depths of the won t wear ever again pile , i decided to observe my day to day habits i jotted down in my journal everything i d done over a couple of weeks i wrote down all the unhealthy snack attacks i d had , all the tv re runs i d watched , and how my mood fluctuated when i was as sedentary as a sloth most days ! interestingly i noticed that my busiest and most productive times were between am and am when i did most of my blog post sharing , commenting , and interaction on social media i then settled down to write , either blog posts or my current work in progress once lunchtime arrived , i started to slow down for me , this is inevitable as i am still coping with the after effects of my viral illness i will curl up and get on with reading the books i have scheduled for the review team i m a member of , so i m working but also resting once the kids come home , i begin the family routine interspersed with work social media it was quite insightful to see on a day to day basis where i was wasting time and when my bad habits emerged , but more interestingly , these periods of procrastination also coincided with my dip in mood i realised that nothing would change about my anxiety and depression if i didn t take small action steps the habits i wanted to implement could fill that void of time and consequently lift my mood so , i joined the gym ! before i signed on the dotted line , however , i checked through my diary and added in pen swim sessions twice a week and booked on a pilates class just like a work meeting , doctor s appointment , or social event , by adding my sessions in the diary it becomes a to do task that has had time allocated to it recently , i was asked if i wanted to go for coffee but when i spotted the word swim in my diary , i declined and suggested another date that small change has helped me to create a better habit another good idea , if you want to create better habits , is to gather yourself a support network this may include a group of girls who go swimming with you , or simply texting a friend to say you re going to the gym on a specific day it makes you accountable for your actions , and you re more likely to carry through with your intentions when it comes to our healthy eating habits , i have recently found that doing it all differently helped me enormously i d got myself into a dieting rut and spent most of my time over analysing everything i ate for me , this wasn t good for my anxiety , so i decided to adopt the habits of a skinny person and just get on with my life and not think too much about weight goals years spent at slimming clubs have shown me the types of healthy meals i should be eating , and i no longer drink alcohol , so my weekend calorie count is nothing like it used to be the relief i felt when i freed myself from dieting restrictions was incredible and i lost lb ! i want my swimming to become a regular part of my life , but only i can create that it takes days to turn a small change into a routine habit but if i believe in myself enough then i ll make it happen do you have any habits you would like to shed ? or maybe you have a solid tip for changing routines and creating better habits ? i d love to hear your thoughts
