cornwall council s much anticipated study , compiled and written by emma goodall and paul wilkins , was published at the beginning of december this has obtained empirical evidence of the impact on bia s of the supreme court judgment that came out last year i wrote about this judgment , which it was anticipated would have far reaching effects on the workloads of amhps and bias , here cornwall s research complements the college of social work s document assessing the impact of this judgment on amhp practice , about which i wrote here so that s enough of the links for now what did this time study actually find ? since the cheshire west judgment extended the qualifying criteria for incapacitated people who might be in situations where they are being deprived of their liberty , it was thought extremely likely that there would be a huge increase in requests not just for formal assessments under the mental health act , but also for requests for deprivation of liberty authorisations , which have to be undertaken by best interest assessors as this report highlights , the first annual statistics published by the health information centre in september reports that there has been a tenfold increase in new referrals , with , dols applications received by councils between st april and st march i am certainly aware that it is not uncommon for local authorities , who are responsible for conducting these assessment , to have backlogs of , or more the research took the form of asking practicing bias via a wide range of social media to complete a questionnaire relating to their practice and experiences they received responses from a total of bias , which i think is a remarkable achievement the study focused on the overall time that each assessment took , looking in particular at time taken in traveling , gathering information and consultation prior to and following the assessment , the length of time spent at the hospital obtaining necessary information , consultation with other relevant assessors , writing up the necessary documentation , and giving feedback to interested agencies and individuals the study found that the overall average time taken to conduct a dols assessment was minutes , or hours this compares with an average of minutes , or hours , that local authorities estimate that an assessment should take some of the bias in the study reported a considerable discrepancy between the hours what they were paid for , and the actual length of time taken , for example one bia saying i m paid for hours but each assessment takes at least hours while it may be tempting for local authorities to attempt to quantify the time taken and set a standard timescale for completion of assessments , the study points out that , while dols assessments can vary widely in complexity , in all cases the bia must involve the relevant person in the assessment process , consult widely and gather information relevant to their decision making and provide a report that explains their conclusion and their reasons for it this work can be time consuming , particularly when there are several consultees or extended travelling times the study also makes the point that bias have enormous responsibility in making their assessments , as they can be open to legal challenge the law commission recently published its consultation document into mental capacity and deprivation of liberty , which i considered here among its recommendations , the first of which is the abolition of dols as incomprehensible and unworkable , is the proposal to create the approved mental capacity professional amcps would have more far reaching powers than bias , and would carry even greater responsibility were these proposals to be made into law through amendments to the mental health act , it would be interesting to see the impact both on the work of this new professional compared to the bia , and the overall bombardment rate of local authorities for people lacking capacity
