for whatever reason , on this last day of may , i spent a lot of time reflecting today and my reflections led to gratitude it all began with my morning speed workout i ran x meters i thanked god for the ability to run as i wished i thanked him for the lung capacity and the muscles to run fast i thanked him for the beautiful sun and the trail through the woods and that 's when the reflection began i reflected back just days , which was when my recent depression relapse began in earnest it was only days ago that the slide into suicidal despair started i reflected on how well i 've been feeling lately and thanked god for the night and day difference i'm grateful today for a quality inpatient psych unit , a doctor who cared , medication , therapy , and yes , even ect it 's been less than one month since this recent relapse ended i'm so appreciative of how good my mood has been over these past few weeks i do n't know why the relapse started i do n't know exactly what caused it to end it does n't matter taking advantage of the good days , that 's what matters now and that 's what i plan to do i'm grateful for the opportunity
