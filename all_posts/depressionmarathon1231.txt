wow hard to believe it 's here , the beginning of my last week of training the race is on saturday , june i just finished a pretty good week , so it 's big time taper time i actually finished my week with a k race i like to run a short race the week before a marathon or half marathon to speed up my legs after all that long slow training it also gives me an idea where i'm at , which was particularly crucial this week after my last two weeks of fatigue and stress it went well averaged per mile , and i think i may have had a little too much left at the end i could tell i had missed some mileage and tempo runs , though i 've also been having some hip pain the hip i 've had surgery on twice which is a bit disconcerting , so i may have to swim rather than run this week but overall i'm feeling pretty good about my preparation , and i'm looking forward to the race here 's the rest of the summary for week fourteen of the garry bjorklund half marathon training program week june , ran days miles long run speedwork mile race swam minutes found money have a good week everyone ! think fast thoughts for me on saturday !
