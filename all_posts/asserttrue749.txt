it seems a lot of pundits out there think the oracle sun acquisition is to a large degree about oracle wanting to establish more of a foothold in the cloud computing biz i wo n't disagree with that what 's bizarre , though , is that it was n't that long ago in fact , september that larry ellison drew some flak for his public rant on cloud computing , in which he called cloud computing total gibberish the youtube audio track of it is here i wrote a blog for cms watch about some of this back in november here 's some of what ellison had to say last september the interesting thing about cloud computing is that we ve redefined cloud computing to include everything that we already do i can t think of anything that isn t cloud computing with all of these announcements the computer industry is the only industry that is more fashion driven than women s fashion maybe i m an idiot , but i have no idea what anyone is talking about what is it ? it s complete gibberish it s insane when is this idiocy going to stop ? you tell us , larry you tell us
