don t take this as gospel but i want to share my observations what i see of death and dying is that different personalities die of different diseases or for different reasons those who were always hyperactive , who never stopped , who worked around the clock and could not sit still will die of a stroke the imprint here is first line , that is , either during gestation , around birth or just after it affects the brainstem terror , dealing with life and death , and constantly galvanizes the system into activity that never stops so long as the imprint is unchanged it goes on for a lifetime the brainstem sends impulses up to the top cortex the brain then manufactures all kinds of projects and plans to rationalize the imprint and , it nearly always dictates hypersexuality if we want to know about infidelity , look here too the terror center of the brainstem , the locus ceruleus , is no doubt one of the culprits here it is busy because traumas during gestation and around birth are nearly always a matter of survival that memory endures why don t they die of cancer ? because repression is faulty those who die of cancer are also first line blockers whose repression is effective even in the womb the inhibitory serotonin endorphin systems work well , too well ! these people don t have as many outlets as they should also , the nature of the birth trauma usually enhances repression massive anesthesia given to the mother which intrudes into the baby s system then we have the compounding , very repressive parents , disciplinarians who smother the child and her feelings prescription cancer look around and see who dies and of what now , those who squelch their feelings put enormous pressure on the right hemisphere and a right side stroke can be the result those who live in their heads , intellectuals and very religious individuals , have a good deal of right side feelings whose energy travels to the left ideational side the result , a left side stroke as i said , this is not gospel
