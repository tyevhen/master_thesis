alcohol abuse is the third leading cause of preventable death in the u s behind smoking and obesity creating a burden to the u s economy of about billion a year data from twin studies and other studies have long suggested a strong genetic component to alcoholism it 's widely claimed that the heritability of alcoholism is about this number is supported by the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism , for example , as well as at least one meta analysis of twin and adoption studies for a dissenting meta analysis , see this paper no one expects that alcoholism will turn out to be a simple matter of inheriting one or two alcoholism genes although at one time , this was in fact the hope instead , it 's expected that multiple genetic features probably interact to produce the propensity to develop alcohol dependence even so , if alcoholism is as heritable as people say it is , and if it involves a tractable number of genes dozens or scores , rather than hundreds or thousands , candidate genes should be fairly easy to discover using the powerful new tools of dna analysis candidate snps single nucleotide polymorphisms should jump right off the page and hit you in the face if gene copy number variants are involved , it should be readily apparent if genes are involved at all , it should be pretty obvious pretty fast that 's not what we find genome wide association studies gwas are able to account for only a small proportion of the known heritability of alcoholism this small proportion of heritability problem is true also for gwas investigations of things like body height a trait that 's even more heritable than alcoholism , where only of the variability of human body height can be accounted for by the more than genetic features thought to control it in fact , the general failure of gwas to account for heritable conditions is so widespread , papers have been written about it the general idea behind gwas is the common disease , common variant hypothesis , which says that common diseases are attributable to potentially many allelic variants genetic differences present in a sizable percentage of the population in gwas , several hundred thousand to more than a million single nucleotide polymorphisms snps are assayed , per person , times hundreds or often , thousands of individuals , and statistics for the expected versus actual rate of occurrence of various snps are calculated snps that appear to travel together down through the generations are assessed for linkage disequilibrium to determine if they are associated more often than normal population statistics would predict the data sets generated in gwas are enormous and the statistical calculations challenging for a description of the technique , see this article also see this piece for criticisms of the technique and a spirited rebuttal of criticisms one of the best known gwas alcoholism studies is the so called german study , by treutlein et al this study which was likely underpowered , statistically and the authors admit this included study subjects with dsm iv alcohol dependence and control individuals the study claimed to have detected and replicated evidence for association of markers to alcoholism , although only snps were in genes the rest were in what used to be called junk dna and only two met criteria for genome wide significance the two snps that met criteria for genome wide significance were colocated base pairs apart in chromosomal region q the long arm of chromosome less well known is the gwas conducted on two samples n and n of korean men by baik et al , which found that a dozen snps on chromosome had genome wide significant associations with alcohol consumption most of the snps were in intronic regions of genes corf , ccdc , myl , oas , cux , and rpha three of these successfully replicated in the second test arm these locations were not the same as the ones found in the german study nor the studies below on the other hand , it 's not clear whether results applicable to korean men will be applicable to non korean men , or women also , this was not a case control study , but an imputation based study using an asian subset of hapmap baseline data another study , often called the sage study , by bierut et al , looked at alcohol abuse subjects and controls here , snps of interest were identified , but only one snp identified as rs was among the identified in the german study , and it did not reach genome wide significance said the researchers our top association signals were not replicated in the independent datasets nor did the present study replicate the two genome wide significant results reported by treutlein and colleagues one of the independent datasets was a large family based study of families with more than , genotyped individuals , while the second was a study of alcohol dependent men and community based comparison subjects of german descent in , heath et al looked at individuals of whom were alcohol dependent from the australian twin registry it 's hard to interpret the heath writeup , but it appears some of the study population were twins and some were parents of the twins , while all of the controls were non alcohol dependent twins so imagine that a twin study that 's also a gwas no findings reached genome wide significance p for this study of the top snps , had effect sizes of less than of the variance when ranked by p value for association with heavy drinking , and only had effect sizes greater than , with a median effect size of so in other words , the main finding was one of small effect sizes the heath writeup was quite clear on this point , stating the primary conclusion from these analyses is that , as for many other complex phenotypes e g body mass index , effect sizes for the contribution of individual genetic variants to differences in heaviness of alcohol consumption and alcoholism risk are small , perhaps accounting for as little as one tenth of one percent of the variance the fact that heath et al found snps with effect size or more is not terribly helpful from an alcoholism prediction standpoint , because while in theory those snps , put together , might account for of phenotypic variance if their effects are addictive , in reality it 's unlikely you 'd inherit all defects together and it 's not clear whether you 'd have to inherit one copy of each , or two but even if you did , it raises your alcoholism risk not the that 's so often claimed the heath group also reported no snps or tagging snps confirmed in the german alcoholism gwas study were replicated in our analyses , nor were any snps or tagging snps identified as the most strongly associated snps in the sage study in other words , the german results did n't replicate in the heath study , nor did the results of bierut et al edenberg et al , in a case control study involving people , found somewhat more encouraging results arguably although no single snp met genome wide criteria for significance , the researchers found that out of top snps from the german study were significant in our primary analysis of alcohol dependence no p value stated so in some sense , the german results replicated for edenberg although it 's by no means clear that edenberg 's snps were among the german group 's top snps read the study carefully it just says of the top also , using a variety of types of evidence , edenberg et al argue that a cluster of genes on chromosome are associated with alcohol dependence , but no effect sizes were given it should be noted that genome wide significance mentioned several times above is a fairly stringent criterion the need for it arises from the fact that any time you look at frequency numbers for a million data points , some are statistically likely to jump out producing false positives unless you correct for the sheer number of data points my reading of the studies is that no smoking pistols were found some of the snps are suggestive of a relationship to alcohol dependence , but i would n't exactly call the results strong , because in general , the studies all found different snps in different genes with only a couple of exceptions , and many of the snps were not in genes some of those that were , were in introns the studies were not terribly robust in terms of replication neither within studies nor between them certainly , any hope of finding an alcoholism gene singular are dashed in fact , it appears unlikely that any gene , of any kind , will be found that can explain more than a few tenths of a percent of your likelihood to have gotten alcoholism from your parents or grandparents how , then , is alcoholism heritable ? we know it runs in families , yes but that does n't mean it 's more than a few percent genetic lots of things that are n't genetic run in families poverty , political beliefs , the tooth fairy myth , etc an affirmative answer to the question did you have your back rubbed ? has been shown to be heritable for males and heritable for females environment , in all likelihood , is the great multiplier , the amplifier that brings out the weak signal in dna that 's what future research will probably end up telling us that 's what the research tells us now i'm in the process of finishing a book on mental illness it 's an evidence based book , part science , part memoir it 's not as technical as this post , though ! it 's meant for non technical readers for more info , sign up for the mailing list , and return here often thanks !
