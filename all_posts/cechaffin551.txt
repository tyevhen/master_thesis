the end of the world this is the end of the world , my love , this is the belly of night , a savage stillness of universe to smother our short loan of light do not take off your clothes , my love , do not tempt my desire the vanquished earth is tired of us , she is tired of us , she is tired and the vanishing stars are disinterested in any affectionate play they look to the weighing of everything i tremble to see what we weigh ce written i searched google for bipolar poetry after reviewing web entries i realized that sites by bipolar poets are cliche' mine was n't among them but in searching for blogs , mine is currently at the top of the list only because a recent post included the two key words july forgive this blog , i beg you the little discipline of writing in it each day gives me a brief respite from the devils in my head in my depression i am disgusted with and embarrassed by this blog why dance around in my psychic underwear ? feel free to throw tomatoes if they become lodged in my shell like kafka 's cockroach , i 'll ignore the stench of their decay my soul smells worse anon
