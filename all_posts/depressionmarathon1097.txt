being single on new year 's eve not priceless new year 's eve , i think , is a tough holiday when you 're single maybe it 's worse because i just went through christmas and my birthday alone , too i do n't know this year was supposed to be different , however i was supposed to have a date i was supposed to , but then it began to snow and blow in the northeast , and now i do n't have a date i no longer feel like attending the sober party to which we were invited i feel like sitting here watching football in my pj 's , alone probably not the best plan , i know , but i'm so disappointed my new year 's eve just went from being a highly anticipated night to the dreaded , familiar bore the wind has been sucked from my sails the wind has been sucked from my sails , but it 's more than that , i think this is a new relationship , a long distance relationship immediately after his first voicemail , my distrust was peaked fear , fear , fear it 's not snow , it 's me that was the familiar spot on which my thoughts took roost i'm disappointed and afraid i do n't like living in fear recovery taught me not to do that , and i thought it was a lesson i had learned but then no call , no voicemail , only the dreaded text message ! not coming sorry really ? really ? is that it ? is it really an airport problem ? i want so desperately to believe desperately ! but two unanswered calls later , and my distrust wo n't leave me alone it 's amazing how quickly my old thought patterns lock me up when i'm scared and i'm scared i want to trust , but i do n't addendum it 's am now and still no word fortunately , i said , screw it , and went to the party anyway i had a really good time ! even better , it was the first sober new year for several of the guests very cool to help them celebrate , sober style ! very nice to be surrounded by a lot of fun , sober people while ringing in i'm so glad i went it was way better than staying home and watching football in my pj 's
