it 's monday it 's a much needed rest day for me no exercise , just work i ca n't even walk puck tonight it 's just too hot and sticky outside ! oh well , like i said , i needed a rest day i'm coming off a good weekend as planned , i got up early and ran miles saturday morning i'm still a little stunned it went as well as it did of course , i was tired and my legs were dead in the last couple miles , but overall i felt good , held a nice pace , and recovered very well i was able to spend the rest of my day relaxing , socializing , and walking with puck i worked at the hospital yesterday it 's my very part time weekend gig i ended up with some really nice , motivated patients the day was n't too long , and i got in a minute recovery swim after i was done at the end of the day i had another lovely walk with my boy it was a nice end to a nice weekend things are moving right along , and i'm doing all right by the way , thank you for all of your comments on my last post i really appreciate that you can appreciate my boring posts i do hope that by doing well , i can inspire others to survive , and perhaps even thrive , despite having depression have a great week , everyone !
