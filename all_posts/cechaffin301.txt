we returned from rachel 's memorial with our youngest daughter and her friend , barfie , in tow it 's a great comfort to have sarah with me now neither of us can fill the hollow left by rachel 's death , but it helps to have sarah fill her own space rachel is more defined by what she has left behind in us , a retreating , conforming space like a death mask or a mold for making a bronze i 've never had so much space missing before i believe i am in grief , not the dreaded other condition after hours of travel yesterday , kathleen bravely woke and went to work my idol sarah and barfie enjoy picking blackberries they 're city girls on a more important note , i want to thank all of you who have spiritually supported us during this time rarely have i felt so supernaturally buoyed by the prayers of others craig erick
