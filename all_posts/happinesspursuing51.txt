as you know i m convinced that st john s wort works one has to be religious about taking it or its benefits wear off in a matter of a couple of days but what is a person to do if he is going to be out all day ? it takes two pills three times a day for the brand that i take and carrying a pill bottle around just isn t practical i also don t want to advertise that i m taking it my solution is to simply throw four or six pills in my pocket before i leave most of the time i can remember to take them and it s easy enough to do take them discreetly problem solved well , it didn t work today i had to leave the house just before eight i work at home so this was unusual i was going to take pictures of and interview some people who were harvesting an interesting crop i packed up my camera , notebook and four pills to cover me for the day in case it took that long it didn t i got home at noon i fixed lunch and dug in my pocket for the pills they weren t there i thought that they might have fallen out at some point and i didn t think much of it but then i felt some sort of grit against the cloth of my pocket then i realized what might have happened and pulled the pocket out sure enough the ground up st john s wort , or at least some , of it was still there but the pills weren t it was a hot day and i wore jeans because i knew that this crop was particularly scratchy the result being that i stood around in the hot sun for almost four house sweating into my jeans and dissolving the pills with my sweat hmm , i thought that this would be an amusing anecdote but now that i write it out it just seems kind of icky anyway , here s the punchline ready for it ? here it comes ! my left leg has been in a good mood ever since hahaha !
