in the previous clinical tip i discussed the clinical application of the cosmological sequence of the elements , i e the one placing the elements in the form of a cross i concentrated on the vertical relationship between fire and water and between heart and kidneys in this clinical tip , i will discuss the clinical significance of the earth being in the centre and of wood and metal being on left and right respectively earth in the centre the placing of the earth in the centre of the cosmological sequence of the elements is crucial the earth is in the centre in a cosmological and a clinical sense the four elements of fire , water , wood and metal are placed along a square with fire at the top south , water at the bottom north , wood on the left east and metal on the right west the square has a centre that is the point of reference which pertains to earth there can only be a top , bottom , left and right in reference to a centre the placing of the earth in the centre is completely lost in the sheng cycle of the elements where earth is in between fire and metal as we saw in the previous clinical tip , the sheng and ke cycle introduced by zou yan has a strong political significance from a clinical perspective , placing the earth in the centre has many applications first of all , the spleen is the origin of post natal qi and blood and , as such , it nourishes all the other organs it therefore make sense for earth to be in the centre from the point of view of qi movement , stomach and spleen are in the centre in another sense and that is being in the middle burner between the upper burner above and the lower burner below every organ s qi has a certain direction of movement for example , heart qi and lung qi descend and kidney qi descends the stomach and spleen are in the middle and their qi movement influences all other qi movements stomach qi descends and spleen qi ascends all the other organs depend partially on these two movements of stomach qi and spleen qi if qi movement is disrupted in the middle , it will affect the upper and lower burners from a clinical perspective , tonifying the stomach and spleen tonifies the centre and therefore all the other organs too to do this , i use st zusanli and sp sanyinjiao usually with moxa on the needle this is a very simple and extremely effective treatment that tonifies stomach and spleen and qi and blood of all organs wood on the left , metal on the right the following is an article from the journal of chinese medicine zhong yi za zhi from beijing before reading this article , i should explain the meaning of qi mechanism qi ji the qi mechanism is a term that includes the ascending descending and entering exiting of qi in every organ and every part of the body , qi ascends or descends this is an essential aspect of the physiology of every organ for example , in the middle burner , stomach qi descends and spleen qi ascends apart from the ascending descending of qi , physiology also includes the entering exiting of qi this is a less well known aspect of the qi movement the ascending descending of qi represents a vertical movement of qi while the entering exiting represents a horizontal movement of qi for example , in the cou li space the superficial space between the skin and muscles where wei qi circulates , qi goes in and out this is an aspect of the entering exiting of qi the su wen in chapter says without exiting entering of qi , there would be no birth , growth , maturity and decline without ascending descending , there would be no birth , growth , transformation , receiving and storage all organs rely on the ascending descending and exiting entering of qi the entering and exiting of qi plays an important role in the transformation , transportation and excretion of fluids in liver diseases do not forget to treat the lungs journal of chinese medicine zhong yi za zhi , , p the lungs govern qi and qi regulates the functions of the zangfu the lungs have the function of jie zhi which means to control , to check , to moderate this means that the lungs restrict and regulate the functions of all the zangfu lung qi descends and communicates with kidney water the lung function of restricting , regulating and adjusting the functions of all the zangfu is dependant on the descending of lung qi ascending and descending of qi liver qi normally ascends and this makes the qi mechanism work smoothly , so that qi and blood are harmonized and flow freely there is a saying that states the ascending of qi stems from the liver lin pei qin the lungs is a so called tender organ , it governs qi and its qi descends if lung qi does not descend there is a situation of rebellious qi causing cough ye tian shi said the liver is on the left and its qi rises , the lung is on the right and its qi descends he also said the qi mechanism of our body is mirrored on heaven and earth in nature , the liver is on the left and its qi rises , the lung is on the right and its qi descends when lung qi does not descend , liver qi rebels horizontally therefore , the ascending of liver qi and descending of lung qi are essential for the correct functioning of the ascending and descending of qi in the qi mechanism moreover , the ascending and descending of qi regulates the smooth flow of the qi mechanism please note that this a physiological ascending of liver qi , not liver yang rising in pathological conditions , when liver qi rises too much it impairs the descending of lung qi and therefore it leads to the situation of left ascending too much and right not descending enough this leads to cough , headache , red eyes , spitting of blood , epistaxis etc if liver qi stagnates and does not rise enough , lung qi also stagnates and this leads to breathlessness and a feeling of oppression of the chest , constipation , urinary retention , etc conversely , lung pathologies can affect the liver , such as when lung qi does not descend properly , this could lead to heat which impairs the free flow of liver qi this leads to cough , hypochondrial and chest pain and distension and fullness , dizziness , headache etc therefore the reciprocal control and regulation between the liver and lungs is essential for the smooth function of the qi mechanism the descending and diffusing of lung qi has controlling , regulating and adjusting actions on the rising of liver qi , which reflects also the element control of wood by metal clinical application in many liver qi pathologies , it is necessary to regulate and treat lung qi by strengthening the diffusing and descending of lung qi this has two effects on the one hand it controls heat by restoring the normal ascending and descending and , on the other hand , it frees the passages of the triple burner so that water and dampness are transformed and liver can store blood descending of lung qi subdues rebellious liver qi in conditions of emotional stress leading to qi stagnation , liver qi loses its free flow , the channel qi does not flow smoothly and this can rise upwards to harass heart and lungs stagnant qi turns into heat which rises , lung qi fails to descend and this leads to cough , breathlessness , chest pain , dizziness , headache etc hence the saying , in liver pathology do not forget to treat the lungs herbs that make lung qi descend include xing ren , chuan bei mu , xuan fu hua , su zi , hai ge ke , etc when qi rebels upwards with heat , use herbs such as huang qin , sang bai pi , qian hu , ma dou ling , etc when fire rises upwards in chronic situations and the lungs suffer from dryness , use sha shen , mai men dong , shi hu , pi pa ye etc when lung qi fails to descend and liver qi ascends too much , the formula xie bai san , with the addition of cooling blood and clearing liver heat herbs , can restore the normal flow of qi using a high dose of sang bai pi regulate the qi mechanism in order to relieve stagnation of liver qi in conditions of stagnation of liver qi from emotional problems , besides using herbs which move qi and eliminate stagnation , one must also pay attention to making lung qi descend this will keep in check the ascending of qi , regulate the qi mechanism and promote the smooth flow of qi in the triple burner herbs to do this include pi pa ye , xing ren , chuan bei mu , zi wan at the same time , use herbs which promote the diffusing of lung qi , such as ma huang , jie geng , gua luo pi , etc when stagnation of lung qi has given rise to phlegm , one must clear the upper burner and treat lung qi with herbs such as pi pa ye , xing ren , gua luo pi , yu jin , ban xia , fu ling , sheng jiang , zhu li , etc
