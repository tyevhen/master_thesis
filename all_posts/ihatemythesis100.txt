i'm at a coffee shop independent ! and drinking real coffee not crap ending in the phrase ppuccino from a real glass mug i just ate a muffin that i knew i should n't eat but it 's in the morning i'm actually making thesis progress and i convinced myself it was brain food instead of go straight to my thighs food soon there is nothing left of the muffin except the burnt part the downside of buying local and i start thinking that maybe the coffee was all i really needed to power my brain after all and as i wonder whether or not i will fit in a graduation gown those damn unforgiving , formless , black smocks , i realize that i am eating the burnt parts ! what is wrong with me ? thesis progress of pages written that 's only for chapter , the full thesis is much longer
