it 's a cold and cloudy morning here we never seem to get a spring grumble ! it 's always straight from winter to summer as our ground is still covered in snow ! the good thing about all this cold weather is that i 've been keeping busy and i 've been able to get back to creating and painting ! i 've found the secret to making art as a mother with small children is to use your free time to do what you can if i get minutes devoted to painting or drawing , then i use it it 's not much , but at least i'm minutes further ahead in my project than i was before ! this week i want to share a few of my new pieces that i 've turned into prints for sale in my shop today 's piece is a gouache pronounced gwash painting it 's like watercolor , but more solid and vibrant i love the fable of the tortoise and the hare and recently i told it to paige she was in love with the tale too , so i turned it into a painting with the inspirational phrase slow and steady wins the race very appropriate for my new art making ways ! this piece is great hanging in an office or as nursery art for baby or kiddo i 've been so into the woodland theme lately maybe it 's because i live in the woods ? you can find it in the shop here ! save
