sometimes i have to be sad in the dark in a ball on my bed crying sometimes my breath is all i am sensing in my chest in the moments between nothing sometimes the quiet becomes haunting yet whispers to tell of my soul 's wanting sometimes i think how sad follows loving and i sigh to know the deep down feeling sometimes when the reminders keep me hurting i stop i feel the loss and stop thinking sometimes a softness envelops my being i relax and for a moment i am dreaming sometimes a light breaks in shining for a second and reminds me that it is ok to keep living sometimes i find courage and start moving i hesitate then take a step forward again toward hoping and sometimes i have to be sad in light of my love to honor that which i will always be missing sometimes i have to be sad
