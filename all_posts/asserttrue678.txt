protein alignment paul brown from cloudera on vimeo about minutes into this video , there 's an interesting d visualization of a running hadoop job , showing processor nodes as cubes in a spinning pyramid green nodes are working normally a node turns black and falls down to the bottom , signalling a failed job on that processor i thought it was an interesting visualization but i also found the presentation interesting overall , since i studied molecular biology in grad school and have an interest in bioinformatics beyond that , i have an interest , lately , in all things related to scalability let that be a hint of things to come in future blog posts !
