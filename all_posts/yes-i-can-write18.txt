in the early hours of this morning , a man with an assault rifle walked into a gay night club and opened fire after a several hour standoff with police , it ended in his death , as well as the deaths of at least lgbtq people who were partying in a place where they thought they were safe over people were rushed to hospital , meaning the total death toll is likely to rise over the coming hours and days , news outlets will be rife with speculation , as the investigation continues and new facts emerge already there s lots of talk about it being an act of islamic terrorism , with none of the news outlets seemingly capable of focusing on anything else i know that , regardless of what the shooter s religion was , i won t be blaming muslims , or people of any other religion , as the impetus behind this horrific massacre the shooting occurred at a gay night club , during pride month , in the early hours of the us celebration of pride day this was a hate crime , targeting a minority that , despite the progress made in the last decades , continues to face incredibly high rates of violence , especially the most vulnerable among the lgbtq community queer people of colour , trans women and especially trans women of colour it s not surprising to me that the largest mass shooting in the us since targeted lgbtq people source the blame might not lie with any religion , and i fear greatly for the repercussions muslims , including lgbtq muslims , will face in the coming weeks , as once again a huge population is blamed for the actions of a single person but the blame does lie with more than just the single shooter it lies with a culture of homophobia and transphobia , and with every single non lgbtq person who with their words and actions contributes to a culture of violence against myself , and everyone else in my community of lgbtq people i live in a country canada and a province quebec where it s better for lgbtq people than plenty of other parts of north america better , but not good trans people have to run a bureaucratic gamut to change their legal markers , and face a tremendous amount of transphobia from a frequently ignorant or even hostile medical establishment all lgbtq people still face homophobia from society at large , in popular media , in schools , in homeschooling groups , in almost every group not specifically designed for lgbtq people and sometimes even in those groups that you can find in times when i presented in a more gender bending way , i had people on the street yell at me about my sexual orientation lgbtq friends have all been harassed in greater or lesser ways violence always exists on a spectrum at the extreme , it manifests as the largest mass shooting in the last years of american history but leading up to that exists a wide range of acts that nurtured that shooter i blame everyone who s ever sneered the words faggot or dyke or tranny i blame every person who ever talked primly of those people with their unnatural lifestyles i blame every parent who ever told their children that gays were sinners because it all starts with parents the choices you make , the attitudes you model , the words you say , they shape the future your words can be the difference between a child who knows they are loved unconditionally , and a child who hates an essential part of who they are with such horror and disgust that they kill themselves your attitudes can be the difference between raising a child who embraces their friend when they come out , and raising one who buys a semi automatic weapon and opens fire in a crowded room filled with strangers they genuinely believe deserve to die or maybe it won t be that extreme maybe they ll simply be the kid who sends me a message online telling me i m going to hell the one who calls my friend and his boyfriend faggots parents don t have all the power our culture is homophobic , our culture is transphobic we will be affected by this , every single one of us a young queer person with the most loving and supportive of parents can still feel that there s something wrong with them because of their sexual orientation the straight teenager raised by parents who always spoke positively about lgbtq people can still learn it s okay to use the word gay as an insult you don t have all the power but you do have such an important role to play in helping create a more just and loving world when i read the news earlier today , i sat and cried those people who were murdered early this morning , almost , miles away , were a distant part of my adopted family i haven t been able to get this imaginary image out of my head all day , an image of a dark bar , dozens of bodies scattered across the floor , screaming and crying and a bone deep terror i pray i never get to feel i m heartbroken and i m begging you , please , no matter what religion you follow , to stop contributing to this violence you might think your words are so far removed from this horrific act as to be entirely disconnected , but you would be wrong your words build on the words of others , your actions pool with those of your neighbors , your family , your friends isolated ideas gather strength as they join with others , building momentum until they are laws allowing health care practitioners to turn away a gay man having a heart attack so he can die on the streets they become pastors preaching damnation they become a transgender girl shunned by every age mate she knows for the way she dresses and the name she asks to be called and they lead to the death of at least innocent lgbtq people who just wanted to celebrate pride please , be a voice not just for tolerance , but acceptance , and support speak up , stand up , raise up powerful lgbtq voices , and work to end every tragedy , big and small , perpetrated every day against our community i want everyone to do better because i never want something like what happened in orlando , florida , to ever happen again
