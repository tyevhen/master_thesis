i stood in front of a church sanctuary full of people sunday morning and opened my folder in it i had a journal entry i had written years ago followed by pages summarizing my journey with depression i took a deep breath , and i began nine minutes later i returned silently to my seat , and the service continued i participated in a service dedicated to educating our congregation about mental illness everything in the service was tied to mental illness in one way or another , even the music until sunday i had no idea the composer robert schuman struggled with bipolar disorder his entire life and actually died in an insane asylum besides me , there were four others who shared their journeys it was a powerful , somber service i'm so glad i shared i procrastinated preparing for it until the day before but once i got going , the words flowed the journal piece i started my presentation with is quite descriptive of the despair which is depression it seems to make people sit up and take notice from there , my story is powerful enough , i guess , because the feedback i got after the service was amazing it was a great experience all of the stories were powerful all were unique but shared common themes of loneliness , despair , stigma , and pain we all received support and positive feedback afterwards i was stunned and humbled by the amount of passionate feedback i received this was one of the most positive speaking experiences i 've ever had i hope some of you find similar opportunities to have your voices heard i recommend it
