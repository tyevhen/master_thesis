a reader asked me to do a follow up post on my trip to miami i have gotten this request in the past so here i go i am really glad that i went even though it was n't the easiest thing in the world to be honest , the worst my anxiety got was before we even went on the trip the anticipatory anxiety , or dreading what was to come , had me so nervous about all the what ifs that could happen for about a week i could tell my anxiety was heightened and i did some extra things to try to keep things in perspective i did some yoga and i prepared for the trip in my last post to help me work all those what ifs out i also made sure i had plenty of medication just in case i was really worried about the hour plane ride we read up on the airline 's website what to expect when traveling with a baby so the extra security to check her bottles was n't a suprise and the security was extremely quick and smooth we still went in expecting the worst to happen , which comes second nature to a habitual worrier however , we were pleasantly surprised at how well the whole airport and flight experience went and any rocky parts that occured were manageable it could have been much worse i would much rather be pleasantly surprised then constantly disappointed from high expectations during the week we made a point to keep things low key my husband 's brother was showing us around and he wanted to jam pack every day with lots of stuff but i knew that overscheduling the days was n't a good idea for me we made sure that we had plenty of time to just hang out at the pool and beach and relax with a few fun activities each day my anniversary gift was to swim with dolphins at the aquarium my husband went on some scuba dives with his brother , we went to the aquarium , we toured the everglades and walked around the south beach area shops but we did n't overplan it because the more i am expected to do on a trip , the more nervous i get about ruining the trip it helped that we had to go back to our hotel anyway so the little could take a nap when she napped i went and lounged at the pool and beach area it was really nice and relaxing i am learning that just because i have had really bad anxiety on trips in the past , that does n't mean that i am bound to have it on all trips but i know that preparing anyways is important if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email
