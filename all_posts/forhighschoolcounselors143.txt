our referrals generally include issues in relationships , academics , conflict , family , and behavior sometimes my peer listeners are great at identifying bullying and some severe underlying issues that require a referral to a school professional what types of skills do peer listeners acquire ? our peer listeners learn and practice the following skills attending skills non verbal communication active listening empathy brainstorming problem solving confrontation use of silence when to break confidentiality how many stages are in the peer listening model ? there are four stages that students must learn and practice stage getting to know each other and setting the guidelines in this stage , the student will introduce him herself to the peer and discuss his her role , the guidelines of the relationships , and limits of confidentiality following this important information , the student will break the ice by asking the peer to tell about him or herself stage listening to the story encourage the peer to tell the reason for his or her referral if the peer is reluctant , continue to build a relationship to establish trust if the peer opens up about his or her issue , it is time to start using peer helping skills like restating , paraphrasing , reflecting feelings , and empathizing stage brainstorming options allow the peer to brainstorm options for his or her problem stage follow up it is important to make sure to support the peer and that he or she follows the action plan if the student is not following the plan , review the plan when should a peer listener refer ? one should make a referral to a school professional if if you feel uncomfortable when you believe the person is not improving obvious negative changes in appearance or behavior the person gets so emotional that he or she cannot communicate the person talks about constant physical complaints substance abuse it seems the peer may be having a hallucination or hearing voices threats to self or others aggression and abuse the situation gets unbearable if you feel unsure , please refer ! what are the ethics a peer listener should follow ? here are our ethical code from my school i have both parents and students sign and i conduct an orientation we honor confidentiality whatever we say stays in this room except if you or someone is going to harm yourself themselves , someone else , or someone is harming you them we do not gossip or share information about each other , our helpees , or staff we do not use put downs or offensive words , including shut up we value and respect other people s opinions and beliefs , even if we do not agree we do not intentionally inflict emotional or physical distress on others we confront and resolve our own issues and problems by using our conflict resolution skills we do not interrupt others while they are talking or presenting we follow all the rules of the school need some help getting started ?
