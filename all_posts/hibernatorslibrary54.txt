chi 's sweet home volumes by konami kanata well , it 's time to catch up on my reviews i'm behind by , and expect to finish one or two more books by the time i catch up on those upcoming are gods behaving badly , by marie phillips confusion of princes , by garth nix the price of silence , by lisa long and neurotribes , by steve silberman this is a minireview of the graphic novel series chi 's sweet home , which was absolutely adorable it 's about a newborn kitten who loses her mommy and is found and adopted by a nice family the family has many troubles with chi because they are not allowed to have a kitten in their apartment the story covers her adventures growing up for what i would assume is several months though she does n't seem to grow much in size she has many kitten like adventures , and makes some good kitty friends along the way the little boy in the family is also adorable , though his age is indeterminate the art for this book was so , so cute and the story was realistic in the sense that the author clearly knows a lot about how kittens act it reminded me a lot of my own kittens especially the one i found lost in a street gutter a few years ago she was so forlorn and scared ! and she was always chewing through cords anyway , if you like graphic novels for kids , this is a great one to pick up
