going off my last post it s ok to have emotions it s how you deal with them that matters , your temperament has a lot to do with how you deal with your emotions if you don t already know , your temperament is your natural inclinations , behaviors , and responses to life it is not your personality , your character , or your fate who you are is not limited to your temperament your character is made up of your education , environment , free will , family of origin , habits , health , etc your temperament is , however , a general set of guidelines to help you better understand yourself and others there are four categories sanguine , phlegmatic , choleric , and melancholic these four distinctions of human reactions date all the way back to the time of socrates , plato , and even hippocrates some people are skeptical of categorizing because they feel put in a box the temperaments are not an excuse to sin or act in an uncharitable way on the contrary , knowing your primary and secondary temperaments can help you develop your strengths and work toward overcoming your weaknesses why do you notice the splinter in your brother s eye , but do not perceive the wooden beam in your own eye ?
