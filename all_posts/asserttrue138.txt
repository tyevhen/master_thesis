a week or so ago , in an attempt to get a more stable browsing environment , i upgraded firefox on a toshiba laptop , my primary work machine to the latest greatest version , and separately downloaded and installed the very latest version of flash player within two hours , my browser hung it was flash player , gone apeshit as usual flash is easily the least reliable , least secure , most power hungry , incessantly out of date piece of software on my machine it is relentlessly unstable , unpredictably using disk , grabbing memory , hanging , stalling , crashing , updating , bringing my browser and indeed the whole machine to its knees it 's an absolute atrocity , a horrific impediment to getting work done it 's time for the madness to end it was time , five years ago that was when steve jobs warned us of flash 's inapropriateness in a commendably calm , well reasoned blog we should have paid heed adobe now needs to pay heed it needs to set an end of life date for flash and begin transitioning us off the software from hell , toward html , immediately it needs to acknowledge , in public , that flash is wrong for the web , wrong for mobile , wrong for security a technological dead end adobe 's best bet is to wash its hands of the technology in a public way , as soon as possible in , mozilla released shumway , an open source replacement for flash that automatically converts swf files into html using javascript google 's swiffy does the same we need to leverage these and other ways to get flash the hell out of our lives i take no pleasure in having to say any of this as a former adobe employee , i have mostly good things to say about adobe technologies but not about this technology this technology is evil as jason koebler said over at vice , it 's the internet 's least favorite tool flash originated with futurewave 's smartsketch animator , a product developed by jonathan gay full history here interestingly , in futurewave approached , but was rebuffed by , adobe in , macromedia approached futurewave about working together thus began the product known as shockwave flash , which adobe later inherited when it bought macromedia in the internals of flash are semi interesting , if you 're a geek , but we 'll skip that the important thing to note is that flash was never a bonafide web standard in the sense of being blessed and managed by an industry group like wc it has always been a proprietary bastard technology under the control of a commercial giant adobe did try to open it up in various ways , but their efforts fell squarely in the too little too late category pdf is more of an open standard than swf is , but that , alas , is not saying much either experiments with proprietary semi open standards never go well ask microsoft about silverlight if we should have learned anything from the last years , it 's that standards matter things like html , css , javascript , xml , http matter a great deal they 're too important to remain the slightest bit proprietary adobe foolishly and arrogantly pushed back when steve jobs issued his warning now they pay the price at the time of jobs 's blog , flash was used in of all websites today , it 's used in just over and no one i know wants to have flash on his or her machine having worked for adobe , i can speculate on why the company continues to develop and defend flash arrogance and misplaced self confidence lack of humility unwillingness to take criticism and admit flaws those traits permeate adobe culture in my opinion , as they permeate many , many corporate cultures it 's not too late for adobe to do the right thing help rid the planet of flash which at this point is principally important to the porn industry , malware creators , advertisers , some gamers and maybe law enforcement if it acts fast , adobe can limit the damage flash does to its reputation , daily or it can maintain its posture of arrogance either way , steve jobs wins have you checked out my free book mental health myths debunked ?
