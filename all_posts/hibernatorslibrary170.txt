i am malala the girl who stood up for education and was shot by the taliban by malala yousafzai and christina lamb narrated by archie panjabi i am malala is malala yousafzai 's memoir about her time in pakistan promoting education for girls she begins by discussing her family from her grandparents , to her parents , and then to herself she discusses the major political and geological forces that impacted her childhood and led up to her eventually being shot by the taliban she finished the book talking about how she felt when she awoke in england not knowing what had happened or where her family was it is truly an amazing story since i read this book for non fiction november , i will write my review in a different format than usual , by answering a list of questions what did you think of the tone and style in which i am malala was written ? while listening to the book , two things occurred to me the first is that the tone was a bit naive and honest in the way only a child can be the types of things she observed , for instance , like how much or less attractive someone was than herself their skin color , etc i realize these things are thought about by adults , but the innocent way she brought them up was darling i also felt that the way she talked about her competition for being first in class was cute in an adult that would seem like a lack of humility if talked about with such frequency but in her , it was sweet it also occurred to me that the writing was much too fleshed out to be entirely written by a young teenager there was some obvious journalistic questioning going on before writing the book and that is to the benefit of the story , and clearly the work of christina lamb what did you think of the political commentary in the book ? i found the political commentary interesting , especially since i'm only somewhat educated on the subject the commentary obviously did n't have the powerful understanding shown in a book like the kite runner , by khaled hosseini but it showed that malala was quite intelligent and observant it was interesting hearing those events from the eyes of a child as long as i'm comparing the book to fiction , it reminds me somewhat of in the country of men , by hisam matar in the sense that it is about adult events narrated from the eyes of a child of course , there are three major differences location , fiction non fiction , and the age of the author but still , i think it 's an interesting comparison did anything particularly surprise you about malala s daily life or culture ? i was surprised to hear how socially active malala was before she was shot i assumed the story was about a girl who became active only after she was shot in other words , that the bullet was random , and that it gave her an opportunity to speak out but , no , she was from a privileged environment at least at the end and was shot because she was speaking out do you think you would act similarly to malala in her situation ? if you were her parents , would you let her continue to be an activist despite possible danger ? i would n't be as brave as malala , nor do i think i am as intelligent as malala if i were her parents , i would support her doing whatever she felt was best that 's what my parents always did with me it 's a great way to let a child grow into her own what did you think of the book overall ? i do not usually read memoirs not sure why , i just tend to gravitate towards the heavier non fiction but this book was pretty fascinating for me malala was so intelligent and perceptive i loved her voice i do n't mean the narrator 's voice , though she did a lovely job this book makes me want to read more memoirs i would normally give this book stars for writing and interest level , but since it 's such an important topic , it gains an extra star
