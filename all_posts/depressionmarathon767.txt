not much to report today , and that 's a good thing it was a gray day , but i had a list of things to do , and i accomplished them all i love crossing things off a list it makes me feel so productive unfortunately , my first order of business was battling with a health care company about a bill , which they had no business sending me ! i do not owe them , yet there i sat with the bill i 've battled with this company before they ca n't seem to figure anything out it 's frustrating i said my piece , stomped around the house for a few minutes , and then tried to let it go i hate having to deal with this kind of shit , especially before finishing my morning coffee ! things got better from there i finished my coffee while taking care of some business over the phone i ordered refills of my meds i took puck for his mile run , which served as my warm up after dropping puck at home , i completed a daunting speed workout i ran x meters at minute per mile pace i thought it would be way more difficult than it was i actually ran them all around pace , and i felt great afterward not overly tired or drained i love it when my running feels like that ! after my shower , i did some more painting i'm getting close to finishing one more coat and i 'll be done finally then it was time for a luxurious hour nap i do take a lot of naps , but i rarely have the time nor the inclination to just let go and sleep i had nothing pressing to take care of afterward , so i just relaxed it was lovely in the evening , i did a little shopping for some new lights the old lights look really bad now that i 've spiffed up the place then i attended my usual aa meeting before going out to dinner with my parents we had the never ending pasta at the olive garden i'm stuffed ! my mom and step dad are leaving town tomorrow i'm still sad about that , but that 's life i 'll survive it was nice to have dinner with them it was a good day things are going well there is life with depression , and life is what i 've been doing lately pretty normal stuff pleasantly non dramatic i 'll take it
