do you find yourself eating when you re not hungry , or eating to until you are uncomfortably full ? or do you eat too little when you are stressed out or anxious ? do you taste your food , or do you eat without thinking ? do you ever regret eating something ? do you beat yourself up for overeating ? first and foremost , it is ok it is ok if you eat too much sometimes and it is ok if you eat too little sometimes we are human we re not going to have perfect eating habits second , because food is such a big part of our lives we eat three meals a day , we need food to live , and food often brings people together , i think it is important to have a peaceful relationship with food i want to have a normal , healthy view of eating for me personally , a normal relationship with food is all about peace and compassion it is about feeling good about my food choices and not obsessing about right and wrong and just as important , it is about being kind to myself when i do make mistakes or feel bad about what i ate whether i physically feel bad , or i mentally feel guilty i don t want to be anxious around food i don t want to miss out on parties and gatherings because i am afraid to eat in front of people i don t want to use food to comfort all my feelings i don t want to eat in secret because i am ashamed of eating and i don t want to let my fear of food stop me from having a fulfilling life sometimes an unnatural relationship with food can lead to an eating disorder not all eating disorders are characterized by starvation or purging click here and here to read more about binge eating disorder many people , including me , use food to cope with difficult emotions , because , well , eating is an emotional experience food nourishes more than just your body eating food can nourish your mind , your soul , and your heart on the flip side , keep in mind that you can nourish yourself in many different ways food is only one way we nourish ourselves exercising , reading , conversations , work , prayer , creating , and other things nourish the whole self as well with this preface in mind , keep reading to find out practical ways to stop emotional overeating become self aware figure out your needs if you are feeling anxious and a little unsettled , close your eyes , put your hand over your heart and ask yourself what you truly need right now maybe you need to have a conversation with your significant other maybe you need to say no to a favor asked of you maybe you need to go to bed early or take a nap why ? well , by taking a few moments to become self aware , you might understand why you are upset or angry or scared , and you won t immediately turn to food to comfort those uncomfortable emotions a lot of times , if you use food to soothe your feelings , you end up feeling worse than when you started you didn t take care of your true needs so now you feel defeated because of overeating and you still feel unsettled with whatever emotion is bothering you at that time eat with your five senses eat slowly , take small bites , smell your food , notice the colors , textures and flavors use all your five senses in your eating experience whether you are eating a meal or a snack , you can use this technique look at your food look at the bite you are about to take , notice what it is , and ask yourself if it looks good or bad or neither smell your food smell the aromas of your plate and your surroundings , does it smell good or bad to you , ask yourself what it reminds you of because smells contain powerful memories feel your food with your fingers if it is finger food is it hot to the touch , is the steam rising up in your face , does it feel squishy or hard , do you like the way it feels in your hands ? listen to your meal maybe your meal is sizzling hot , and also listen to your surroundings , maybe the environment is noisy and chaotic or maybe it is completely quiet last but not least , taste your food really taste your food , ask yourself questions about it , savor each bite slowly , chew slowly and thoroughly do you like it , or does your meal not taste as good as you thought it would ?
