this week i had an opportunity to put my recovery skills into practice during a meeting someone was chewing his gum very loudly smacking his lips and making more noise than i cared for then i glanced at my recovery tools worksheet and noticed that dr low said that people do things that annoy us , not necessarily to annoy us that helped put the situation in perspective ! i certainly did n't need a burst of temper at a recovery meeting
