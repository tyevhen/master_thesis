my wonderful wife has been dealing with kennedy s disease for forty years when we married , neither of us had a clue what life would be like , or years down the road we never imagined kennedy s disease would become a major part of our life we were two nature lovers that enjoyed the great outdoors and ranked hiking in the forest or mountains above most everything else life was good and it was fairly easy thankfully , she has grown into one efficient caregiver early on , she tried to do too much to help and my ego didn t appreciate her over attentiveness during the middle years , she had to bite her tongue many times when i tried something i was no longer capable of doing often ending up in a minor or more serious injury when i fractured both bones in my left leg , she had to put her entire life on hold for ninety days because i couldn t even transfer without help like me , her role has changed and evolved depending upon my capabilities and attitude there were times i thought she might want to throw in the towel , but she never did thankfully what amazes me is how efficient and subtle she is i ll come into the kitchen in the morning and find a bowl and silverware on the counter i open the refrigerator and notice she has cooked up a container of noodles or cut up a salad with all the fix ns i open the drawer in the bathroom and find a new box of breathe right strips you get the idea somehow , almost magically , things are done and items show up to make my life easier just as important , she is ready to give me a good kick in the butt when i need one i know this news might come as a surprise to you , but i am not always the easiest person to live with j so , if i haven t said it enough today , thank you for being there thank you for your patience and support thank you for your strength most of all , thank you for your love i am blessed to have you in my life photo http caregiverscomfort com
