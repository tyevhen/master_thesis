i thought i was healed , or at least healing , but this morning my right calf tied up after only blocks of running bummer i was supposed to do a speed workout of by meters , but instead i headed to the pool and swam by yards the pool was frigid for some reason , so the workout was a bit tougher than it needed to be , but i'm glad i went after my calf tied up i did n't want to do anything except go back to bed and feel sorry for myself fortunately , i nixed that idea and got my butt to the pool afterward , i was pleasantly fatigued i'm not feeling terribly pleasant about my calf , though i'm pretty disappointed i had a terrible long run this past saturday , and now i totally missed today 's run i am scheduled to do a short tempo run thursday and miles on saturday i hope this calf thing is a very temporary cramping situation i 'd rather not miss any more miles of course , if i do miss more miles , everything will be okay i 'll survive the world will not end life will go on acceptance at my aa meeting tonight , we discussed acceptance how appropriate the big book of aa tells me that acceptance is the answer to all my problems today it took me awhile to accept that ironic , i know , but it 's true if i accept the situation , rather than fight it or try to change it , i live with serenity rather than aggravation simple , huh ? yep , not always
