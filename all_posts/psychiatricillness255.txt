i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after a psychotic episode last summer i think i had a mixed episode with psychosis and anxiety it was really frightening and i believed i was dying but no one would tell me i did not sleep for over a week but i did not feel tired and would pace and walk around rather than sitting still ! my mind was racing and my beliefs got more and more terrifying i was diagnosed with depression when i was and i have had three severe episodes since then last summer was the first time i was psychotic and i would rather die and than go through that again i thought i was dying and a part of me did i remember feeling very anxious since i was extremely young , i mean in kindergarten and infant school i would not speak to the teachers , i was frightened and i was getting told off for being rude because i would not answer the teachers i was always in trouble but i never said a word i now believe i had selective mutism which is an anxiety disorder i was just seen as rude and naughty at the moment i am well , i take mg sertraline also known as lustral or zoloft for my anxiety and i take mg of quetiapine as a mood stabiliser i have been stable for about months now , i am back at work and doing well , i am going to the us next sunday for a week on business i'm really enjoying work i do n't ever remember being as content with myself as i am right now i hoovered this morning purely because i did not like the bits on the floor , in the past i have hoovered regularly even obsessively as i would be worried that people thought i was dirty or did not look after myself i'm cooking today and there is only me to eat it i sat in the park on my own yesterday and did not feel like people were looking at me and watching me ! life is great right now i have started this blogg for a few reasons , firstly if one new person understands what it is like to be ill in the mind and understands a friend or family member i will be really happy , it will all be worth it ! secondly while i was sick i felt no body understood , i still ca n't talk to my friends and family about my illness so i feel really isolated and alone i 'd love to hear about other people s methods of coping finally i really really enjoy the little things in life , a dandylion growing in the grass , the smell a frosty morning , a comfortable bed , a hot bath , someone saying thank you , the company of my nephew i have always been too anxious or had my mind running too fast to notice these things before ! i first wanted to kill myself when i was about to everyone else i was just a moody teenager who spent all my time in my room nobody ever came to see what i was doing nobody cared i was an easy target for bullies and i would hang around with all the other kids who were bullied some of whom are still good friends but i was not happy , i planned my suicide , i put the suicide note under my mattress and planned to take an overdose about a mile from my house down a farm track called green lane i just never went through with it i clinged to the hope that life would get better that s enough for now , i want this blogg to be about the little things in life that i really appreciate as i have never really felt in control and enjoyed life so much !
