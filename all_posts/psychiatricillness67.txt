well i watched it it was quite emotional for me each of the three girls had a different impact on me when i was a child i would not talk to any adults outside my immediate family i still struggle with anyone who has the upper hand or in a position of authority although i do comfortably manage polite greetings these days danielle was the eldest and still did n't speak when she was or years old she started a new school to help her overcome her difficulties i felt for her as she was fighting the fight without professional help but with a mother who recognised she was suffering i had to manage without proffessional help , without any help for that matter my mother went through all the emotions discussed by the other mothers the reasoning , the bribary , the desperation , the frustration and even tried disciplining me but i never ever felt she understood she is a strong believer that exroverts are better than introverts , not different , better ! and she never let me forget it i had a conversation , aged or , that i was too old to be shy now i was no longer a little girl and itwas just rude megan is a beautiful little girl aged she was having therapy at school all the other kids had just got use to not talking to her but , she was getting help and starting to win her fight she had a very quiet voice but everyone was quiet and listened to her i remember when i use to try and talk at school , i was not heard the teacher saw my lips moving one day and i was told if i wanted to talk i would have to talk louder i felt so embarrised i did not try again red was the youngest she was eight years old and could not speak to her grandfather she obviously loved him very much ! i missed out on relationships with my grandparents and uncles as i was growing up it is only recently that i have realised how many happy memories my sisters have of them , i have was left out there is still time for meet to know my uncles but it is very hard for me to start a conversation now after so many years of polite hellos and goodbyes with nothing inbetween after this programe i feel inspired to try again one of the childs anxieties started after after talking to a stranger she thought was her mother it was n't her mother said she had never seen anyone so upset after she realised i had a similar experiance when i was very young aged about three i lost my parents i was running up and down the road crying as i looked for them a lady eventually caught me and helped me find them i think i kicked her when she tried to pick me up i screemed the whole time i would not tell her anything tho' i think it was the same day , it was definitely the same place i was hiding behind my dad 's leg as they were talking to another man who had the same trousers on as my dad i was horrified when i looked up and realised i was hiding behoind the wrong pair of trousers my parents were laughing and talking and i thought it was because they had the same trousers on ! 'o ! this all happened before the mutisim set in , but if there was a triggor that day must have been it ! i use to have nightmares about waking up naked for years after finally they spoke to children braking bones and not crying i think the most shocking thing i did was when i was putin the wrong taxi by the school i was about i think the taxi driver took me t the wrong house i got out the car at the wrong house and started walking along the road the taxi driver insisted i got back in the car and he took me back to school i am not moaning and certainly do not feel sorry for myself , but watching the programme really helped me understand how i have got to the place i am today i would not change anything about my life now and all the experiances i had as a child have made me who i am today more the programe will be on bbc iplayer for the next week
