the los angeles times story about google deprecating gears in favor of html got quite a bit of attention in the twitterverse yesterday , and has the blogosphere abuzz now , as well there are several interesting aspects to the story one is that the name microsoft does n't come up at all instead , apple figures rather prominently in the times story in fact , the times 's depiction of google , apple , and wc deciding the fate of the post web evokes images of the big three debating europe 's postwar reorganization at the yalta conference one gets the fanciful impression that microsoft 's future is , to some extent , being decided without anyone from redmond being present of course , that 's not quite true another interesting aspect of the times story is that it talks about html wrapping the various technologies that will ostensibly , soon make gears superfluous , when technically speaking , many of the functionalities being attributed to html in the times story are , in fact , not part of the html specification at all they are part of various other webapps working group specs be that as it may , the decision facing the browser makers at this point is what kind of offline storage to use for browser mediated web apps specifically , will the underlying store support sql , or not ? this is trust me a huge hairy issue hhitm and do n't let the times or anybody else tell you otherwise it 's far from being settled yet html talks about sql quite openly and it appears opera , safari , and soon chrome are implementing webdb , which is a sql database in the spirit of the emerging web sql database spec but that 's not to say webdb is a traditional sql database it implements sqlite , which is another beast entirely know well , though , not everyone wants sqlite or sql , for that matter in fact , microsoft 's adrian bateman has stated that redmond probably will not go that route in a webapp wg teleconference , bateman said microsoft 's position is that websimpledb is what we 'd like to see we do n't think we 'll reasonably be able to ship an interoperable version of webdb trying to arrive at an interoperable version of sql will be too hard websimpledb , also known as the nikunj proposal in deference to the author , nikunj r mehta , of oracle corporation , proposes a key value store of the nosql variety and interestingly enough , this approach is getting serious consideration not only from microsoft but from mozilla as well in the aforementioned teleconference , mozilla 's jonas sicking said we ve talked to a lot of developers , the feedback we got is that we really don t want sql it 's too early to know how it will all play out about the only thing that 's certain at this point is that google has thankfully decided it 's more important to back burner proprietary approaches to web app infrastructure than to stay on board with mainstream industry standards , even if those standards are in some cases still quite fluid and ill formed one hopes microsoft will learn this lesson too otherwise ? yalta will decide
