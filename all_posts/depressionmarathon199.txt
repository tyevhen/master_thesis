i'm on day three of my second admission to the local inpatient pysch unit after my outpatient ect treatment on wednesday , the doctors decided to admit me my mood simply has n't been responding to the decreased number of outpatient ect treatments , so i am back on a daily regimen of short pulsed , unilateral , inpatient ect in addition to the ect , my doctors thought i would benefit from the increased structure provided by the inpatient unit i hate to agree with them , but i agree i hate that i'm back here i'm doing everything in my power to give myself a break and not see this as a personal failure it 's simply depresssion rearing its ugly head and hanging on for dear life it 's not letting up my mood remains very low i'm getting worried i do n't like to feel so low for so long if the short pulsed ect does not work , i worry , then what 's next ? what else can we do to jolt me out of this relapse ? that question has not been answered yet tms therapy has been mentioned , but there is a problem with insurance coverage changing meds is always an option , but that 's not a certainty either if necessary , i may be faced with going back to the traditional , bi temporal ect , which carries with it a lot of negative side effects that 's something i wish to avoid if at all possible i'm choosing to think positively about the course i'm on instead i'm trying not to spend too much time worrying about all the possibilities i'm working on my mindfulness and attempting to stay in the moment instead i'm utilizing the education groups here , the support of the staff , and even riding the stationary bike as able worrying gets me nowhere fast , and it only adds to my misery i'm grateful for the support of my family and friends i'm blessed to have an understanding employer i'm anxious to feel better , get out of here , and put my life back in order until then carry on , my friends
