a new , updated , fresher layout for the blog and a few bits that have cheered me up this week depression is a lonely beast it 's not as if i have a few fellow depressed housemates and we 've synced up like it 's our time of the month , so we sit around in our pyjamas having a cupcake party if only it 's very much a personal thing , i try my best to let others know what 's going on , they can usually tell when my mind is cluttered and bothering me however , i ca n't always tell them the specifics at the time it 's occurring , this may be due to being afraid of certain thoughts and how others may react if i voiced them out loud i'm frequently clouded with thoughts but i ca n't pinpoint what 's really bothering me , why i 've suddenly slumped and ca n't even build a nest for myself on the sofa in front of some familiar tv programme for comfort on days like those nothing can break the flow of those thoughts , i cannot concentrate and yet i ca n't relax either , i'm restless but i just want to lay down in the foetal position for hours and watch the sky go from dusk to dawn , black to blacker as i said , it 's a lonely beast , especially when you ca n't figure out what the problem is so you can share it with others depression is the world 's greatest incognito figure , a master of disguise and a shape shifter the worst part of leaving university and living away from my hometown is not knowing many people here , i can go for months with only seeing the same three people as lovely as they are i miss other human contact , i seem to be afraid that i 'll lose the connections formed at uni , the people that were unknowingly such a huge support when i needed it most i'm also scared that those friendships may not have been as strong as i recall , most memories i have were formed in my first year there back in my second year of uni consisted of me fading away into my lockable room , barely seeing anyone from february onwards i was frequently left agonising over conversations i felt had gone badly , i sweated over the details such as how i fidgeted nervously the entire time or how i knew i ought to have walked away sooner but i was too anxious and awkward to excuse myself and leave most people attempt to convince me that others do n't notice the things i sweat over , but what if they did notice ? what if the image i left them with is one they do n't want to remain in contact with or even be reunited with ? i'm trying my hardest to reach out and keep the connections flowing , but how long will the links remain in tact if i ca n't face returning to the place where everything crumbled ?
