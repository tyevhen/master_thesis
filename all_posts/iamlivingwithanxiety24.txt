nervous people are often troubled by normal body sensations a tingling here , an ache there little annoyances most people would quickly dismiss we have a tendency to analyze , fret over , and work up recently i noticed my ears popping when i was involved in deep concentration on school or work projects i was not worried about a medical condition , but i found the sensations distressing i m far enough in my recovery training to recognize that they were not dangerous , but i started to work myself up over them i had thoughts such as , why are my ears popping ? this is making it difficult to concentrate this is so annoying why won t this go away ? i was being distracted by these thoughts , and my temper began to build when my ears would pop my heart would race and my breathing would become shallow thankfully , i soon remembered dr low s comments on handling such situations we can control thoughts and impulses but not feelings and sensations the latter will quickly pass if we do not work them up dr low warns us against labeling symptoms as intolerable or unbearable , as such language distorts the reality that these are minor annoyances that will quickly pass if we allow them to do so every now and again my ears will pop , but i try not to pay too much attention as dr low predicts , the sensations subside when i don t give them any importance in former days , i would have come to dread ear popping in fact , just the thought of it would have thrown me into a panic thankfully , with my recovery training i recognize that symptoms are distressing but not dangerous , and i can nip potential threats to my recovery in the bud long before they become serious problems
