i'm physically falling apart ! okay , not really , it just feels that way at the moment i think it must be the running tuesday i ran a great speed workout of x meters then i went to the doctor and ended up having my left shoulder injected ouch ! thursday i ran a very nice miler with puck then i went to the dentist and ended up having my tooth pulled ! ouch ! common denominator running prior to my appointments ! perhaps i should think twice the next time i plan to run before a doctor visit
