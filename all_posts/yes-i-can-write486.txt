today , i'm exhausted i had very little sleep last night , since i went to bed exceedingly late and woke up early groan while my dad is out of town my mom is remodeling our pantry , and in the process both making a lot of mess and cleaning up much of our messy house her best friend was over for most of the day , helping and directing a lot got done , but i'm worn out as well as being tired now ! ! during the day i made a quinoa salad , but it was a bit of a flop oh well with some serious tweaking it could still be good speaking of food , i'm seriously considering becoming vegan it would be a big change though , so that 's why i'm thinking a lot before making the decision ! also , my mom 's friend knows of a vegetarian cooking course nearby i think it 's probably a very basic one , though , but i'm going to look into it anyway after the cleaning finally stopped , my mom , sister , and i headed to the local mall for a bit of shopping i got a really cute little black dress for an amazing price ! i listened to some more music in my very little spare time , read a small amount of the teenage liberation handbook , and that was about it i'm going to go eat a very late supper now , and probably get an early night listening to today dear mr president i ca n't get enough of that song ! by jason fisher , day sixteen loser by ayreon one of the greatest bands ever ! reading the tlh you might also like yet more cleaning slight changes shopping and chilling polls , conferences , and cleaning linkwithin
