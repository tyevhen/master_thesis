so , bright and early tomorrow morning , we are heading off into a snowstorm ! ! seriously , we are the forecast is n't looking great , but my mom is a tough montreal driver who is very used to driving in lots of snow , and if it gets too bad we can always pull over hopefully that wo n't impact on our plans , which are to drive to pennsylvania tomorrow , and stay with some lovely people who live near pittsburgh until monday morning , at which point we 'll drive to the kalahari waterpark for the unschoolers winter waterpark gathering ! we 'll be there until friday , when we head to just outside toronto , ontario , to visit my grandfather , whom i have n't seen in several years ! saturday , we 'll complete the final leg of our journey , and return home by that point , i expect to be thoroughly exhausted , but very hopefully cheerful ! i will , of course , have my camera with me , and try to remember to take lots of pictures and i most likely will not have internet access right now i'm both very excited i'm going to be seeing lots of awesome people ! ! , and rather stressed we still have tons of stuff to pack ! ! we 're bringing all of our own food or at least , bringing most of our food , and buying some at a grocery store in the states , because otherwise we could n't afford to go , but that means that today includes cooking and stuff as well as packing and tracking down lost clothing items and buying last minute things plus i signed up for what will be my last year of nbtsc just a couple days ago , so i need to send in my registration form before i leave ! phew , it made me tired just writing all that point being , i have much still to do but i'm excited ! ! oh , and if you 're going to be there , come say hi ! ! enjoy your week , everyone ! peace , idzie you might also like going to the uwwg ! unschoolers winter waterpark gathering unschooling gatherings the unschoolers winter waterpark gathering linkwithin
