the discussion post for the third week of nonfiction november is to discuss nontraditional nonfiction i admit , i'm a really slow reader and by the time i'm relaxing at home with a book , i 'd rather be reading fiction therefore , my traditional nonfiction reading is pretty much at a snail 's pace but i get a lot of nonfiction read through audiobook in fact , i alternate fiction with non fiction when i'm listening , so i get a lot of nonfiction read this way i ca n't recommend a specific book , because there are just too many , and i'm not all that picky as long as the reader is reasonably good , i'm happy instead , let me tell you about why i started listening to audiobooks when i was younger , i never listened in class my teachers in middle school used to accuse me of staring off into space instead of listening , which i really did n't think i was doing by the time i got to high school , i knew i did n't listen my chemistry teacher used to always praise me about how i 'd discovered a new way to solve his problems well , the reason i did n't do it his way is because i never listened to a word he said i had no idea how he told us to solve the problems i did n't tell him that then in college , i had a rather shocking experience i was sitting with a group of students discussing a class one of them mentioned something the professor said i was floored people actually hear what the professor says ? after that , i tried the rest of my undergraduate career i tried really hard to pay attention it did n't work during the first couple of years of grad school , i tried chanting in my head you must listen , you must listen , you must listen somehow i managed to continue that chant in my head while thinking of other things i even tried yoga no luck i just could n't listen to what people said i decided i was audibly challenged as in , low auditory comprehension , not poor hearing that 's when i tried out audiobooks i figured i could practice listening to auditory stimulation while i was exercising and stuff i specifically picked books that i would n't otherwise have read because i did n't want to miss something that i actually wanted to read for instance , i listened to the entire twilight series it worked ! now i am able to listen to books that i want to read , and i do it all the time i like audio for non fiction , because it does n't make my eyes blur over when i'm tired , like written non fiction can though maybe if i stopped reading books that read like textbooks i 'd not have this problem but i like those books ! less importantly , i'm better able to listen in classes now so , thank god for audiobooks !
