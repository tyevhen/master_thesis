just a short post to say thank you to all who commented on my previous post your feedback helped after reading what you had to say , i no longer felt so alone i realized my experience was not unique that helped it really helped my psychiatrist and i also made some changes to my medications last week , and i think those changes have been helpful , too i am feeling better my mood has lifted a bit it 's not stellar it 's not anywhere i 'd like it to be yet , but i have some hope i'm on the mend i'm still isolating i'm still having some trouble sleeping but my energy , thinking and mood are all improved i'm so grateful for that i hope that last post gave some of you the same comfort your comments ended up giving me carry on , my friends we are not alone
