i 've hit my second trimester of pregnancy and bam ! just like that the anxiety is back i did really well the last few months going cold turkey off my meds i expected things to go a lot worse i gained pounds so far which is really great lots of women do n't gain anything because they are too sick the first trimester so i am really proud about that these last couple days however , i ca n't shake this anxious feeling its there when i wake up , and comes and goes throughout the day i have no appetite because i am getting over the flu , and i wonder if that has something to do with it i have lost a pound or two from the flu and that always feels like a setback i ca n't help but wonder if i should get back on my meds now that i am passed the first trimester overall i just do n't feel well anymore my self confidence is down and i am losing faith in myself i am tired of not feeling well , not having energy , etc but i guess it all comes with the territory if you enjoyed this post subscribe to the reality of anxiety you might also like celebrate ! traveling with anxiety trip what to do when feeling overwhelmed traveling with anxiety trip blog against abuse day linkwithin
