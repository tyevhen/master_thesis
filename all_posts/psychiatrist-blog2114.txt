steve 's been helping us figure out how to set up blogger to more clearly indicate who posts what , since there are three psychiatrists who post here sounds like a joke so , these three psychiatrists walk into a blog if i have n't totally broken the template here , you should start to notice that our individual blogs will have some differences in formatting font , color , stuff like that , which makes it easier to tell when we switch this post is , in fact , my test to see if it works should be different font style hopefully , these changes will allow us to stay more grounded , while maintaining a more integrated appearance
