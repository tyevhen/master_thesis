one morning i woke up and feeling rather depressed and uninspired i looked at myself in the mirror i saw a painting this piece is meant to stand against all of the times that we primp and fuss over our looks , it is the most naked portrait of myself that i have done i believe so often we hide behind devices , moods , make up , all manner of tools to distance ourselves and appear to be something we are not i looked upon this piece as an opportunity to depict myself in the most honest way possible i see it as a chance to make something positive out of an initially negative moment self portrait , bedhead actually won a prize as well ! it was in a show at the oakville town hall last year and , to my surprise and delight , won an award i was elated i had a conversation the other day with some new friends and we spoke about the self portrait i spoke how , personally , we really are the only filter through which to experience life we are the vessels where stimuli and ideas coalesce , ferment , and express themselves to the world our bodies are the conduits for the expression our faces and bodies change along with our philosophies and opinions in one , long and lovely ballet through time self portraits can serve many functions as reminders of where we have been , testaments to standing at certain places and times in our lives , experiencing the happiness , pain and bittersweet heartache of things lost and , more importantly , things found for those who know how to read , i have painted my autobiography pablo picasso
