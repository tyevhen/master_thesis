what a busy day ! i 've been going , going , going i guess that 's a good thing it means my mood is back to normal , my thoughts are under my control , and for the moment , all is okay in my world for the moment here 's the recap after sleeping just a bit later than normal this morning , i did some chores around my house , made some phone calls , and prepared some paperwork for my sponsee then i jetted off to the gym for two hours of hard work ! my triathlon class schedule called for a minute bike ride followed by a strength workout the strength workout consisted of three parts first , i did a kinesis circuit kinesis is a series of four machines on each machine i worked both the upper and lower extremities simultaneously for three minutes the second part of the workout was abs a series of exercises done in rapid succession the third section of our strength workout was is the most challenging it consisted of a series of three blocks of exercises each exercise was done for seconds with a second rest period between blocks the exercises included things like squat jumps , push ups , medicine ball lunges , jumping jacks , and sprints of mile oh my god i thought i was going to die this is the third time i 've done this workout , and it has not yet gotten any easier ! after the gym , and despite feeling like a sweaty bowl of jello , i came home to finish my laundry and meet with my sponsee she 's working on her fourth step kind of a critical juncture in aa step work , for those of you unfamiliar we went to an aa meeting after our meeting then i rushed off to the grocery store i hurried through the store in hopes of making it to my friend 's house for lost i did n't make it after putting away the groceries i was done i stayed home so here i sit , sleepy and sore , with lost playing in the background , finishing my day with all of you i do n't always like being so busy , but today was a good day i think i'm back i do n't think i could have done today if i was n't grateful to be feeling better grateful for the energy to work and workout grateful to be sober today good night
