noah has discovered his hands today ! at least , the left one here 's a boring video of him using his left to play with a toy but it 's a first , so i'm happy to have it documented , lol i had a successful doctor visit yesterday i'm now on celexa waiting the weeks for it to kick in and she gave me ativan to take as needed during episodes i tried one yesterday and that stuff is no joke i will reserve it for sleepless nights it made me way too sedated for functioning during the day i looked drunk or better yet , i looked like paula abdul during her american idol tirades creepy ! i'm excited to hopefully feel more relaxed and calm in the coming weeks happy dance ! save you might also like happy paige before and now toy linkwithin
