is n't that title a glorious understatement ? some days are hard with depression , especially my current episode , which i believe is now entering its eighth week , a lot of days are hard i 've been out of the hospital for almost seven days now , and i 'd say five of the seven days have been extremely difficult today is no exception depression sucks and i am so tired of it ! it 's been almost one week since i stepped to the other side of those inpatient doors with an energetic step , a smile on my face , and hope in my heart instead , i 've been battling the battle of illness all over again i am so tired of depression my brain is so broken i thought it was fixed , but that temporary repair appears to have failed quite quickly i 've been following the plan now what do i do ? i 've been attending all of my appointments i'm participating in a daily , afternoon , outpatient transitional program i'm taking my medications as prescribed i'm talking with my treatment team members on an almost daily basis i'm exercising when my tired body allows it today , for example , i was able to run miles amazing yet my brain seems not to notice , or care , or positively adjust broken , it remains my broken brain it seems to be back in control i am pervasively sad i feel discouraged , dejected and hopeless random , negative , violent thoughts bound about inside my skull changing clothes is a chore grooming hardly seems worth it performing household chores is virtually impossible eating ? thank god for yogurt and cold cereal i am once again debilitated by depression i'm so tired i fear this illness will never let me go today was a decent day , yet the sadness , lethargy , and scary thoughts never left this mental and physical fatigue wears me down i am not celebrating thanksgiving with others today i do have plenty for which to be grateful , but i do not have the energy to smile , chit chat , and mingle i fear the energy required to do so would set me back for days instead , i ran today that was a huge success and that will have to be enough after all , i 'd like to be able to get out of bed tomorrow happy thanksgiving , friends with depression , some days are hard my prayer for you is that today is not one of them i hope you all have happy , energetic , easy days !
