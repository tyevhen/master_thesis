there have been dramatic changes in our views on marriage and family life as highlighted in a recent survey conducted by the pew research center in association with time magazine here 's the executive summary of the finding with the full report available online pew research survey the transformative trends of the past years that have led to a sharp decline in marriage and a rise of new family forms have been shaped by attitudes and behaviors that differ by class , age and race , according to a new pew research center nationwide survey , done in association with time , complemented by an analysis of demographic and economic data from the u s census bureau a new marriage gap in the united states is increasingly aligned with a growing income gap marriage , while declining among all groups , remains the norm for adults with a college education and good income but is now markedly less prevalent among those on the lower rungs of the socio economic ladder the survey finds that those in this less advantaged group are as likely as others to want to marry , but they place a higher premium on economic security as a condition for marriage this is a bar that many may not meet the survey also finds striking differences by generation in , two thirds of all twenty somethings were married in , just were how many of today s youth will eventually marry is an open question for now , the survey finds that the young are much more inclined than their elders to view cohabitation without marriage and other new family forms such as same sex marriage and interracial marriage in a positive light even as marriage shrinks , family in all its emerging varieties remains resilient the survey finds that americans have an expansive definition of what constitutes a family and the vast majority of adults consider their own family to be the most important , most satisfying element of their lives here is a summary of the key findings of the report the class based decline in marriage about half of all adults in this country were married in back in , seven in ten were this decline has occurred along class lines in , there was a percentage point gap in marriage rates between college graduates and those with a high school diploma or less in , this gap had been just four percentage points vs the survey finds that those with a high school diploma or less are just as likely as those with a college degree to say they want to marry but they place a higher premium than college graduates versus on financial stability as a very important reason to marry is marriage becoming obsolete ? nearly four in ten survey respondents say that it is in when time magazine posed this question to registered voters , just agreed those most likely to agree include those who are a part of the phenomenon of cohabiting parents as well as those most likely to be troubled by it of self described conservatives despite these growing uncertainties , americans are more upbeat about the future of marriage and family say they are optimistic than about the future of the country s educational system optimistic , its economic system optimistic or its morals and ethics optimistic an ambivalent public the public s response to changing marital norms and family forms reflects a mix of acceptance and unease on the troubled side of the ledger seven in ten say the trend toward more single women having children is bad for society , and say that a child needs both a mother and father to grow up happily on the more accepting side , only a minority say the trends toward more cohabitation without marriage , more unmarried couples raising children , more gay couples raising children and more people of different races marrying are bad for society relatively few say any of these trends are good for society , but many say they make little difference group differences where people stand on the various changes in marriage and family life depends to some degree on who they are and how they live the young are more accepting than the old of the emerging arrangements the secular are more accepting than the religious liberals are more accepting than conservatives the unmarried are more accepting than the married and , in most cases , blacks are more accepting than whites the net result of all these group differences is a nearly even three way split among the full public a third say the growing variety of family arrangements is a good thing say it is a bad thing and say it makes little or no difference the resilience of families the decline of marriage has not knocked family life off its pedestal three quarters of all adults say their family is the most important element of their life say they are very satisfied with their family life , and more than eight in ten say the family they live in now is as close as or closer than the family in which they grew up however , on all of these questions , married adults give more positive responses than do unmarried adults the definition of family by emphatic margins , the public does not see marriage as the only path to family formation fully say a single parent and child constitute a family nearly as many say an unmarried couple living together with a child is a family and say a gay or lesbian couple raising a child is a family the presence of children clearly matters in these definitions if a cohabiting couple has no children , a majority of the public says they are not a family marriage matters , too if a childless couple is married , consider them to be a family the ties that bind in response to a question about whom they would assist with money or caregiving in a time of need , americans express a greater sense of obligation toward relatives including relatives by way of fractured marriages than toward best friends the ranking of relatives aligns in a predictable hierarchy more survey respondents express an obligation to help out a parent would feel very obligated or grown child than say the same about a stepparent or a step or half sibling but when asked about one s best friend , just say they would feel a similar sense of obligation changing spousal roles in the past years , women have reached near parity with men as a share of the workforce and have begun to outpace men in educational attainment about six in ten wives work today , nearly double the share in there s an unresolved tension in the public s response to these changes more than six in ten survey respondents endorse the modern marriage in which the husband and wife both work and both take care of the household and children this is up from in even so , the public hasn t entirely discarded the traditional male breadwinner template for marriage some of survey respondents say that in order to be ready for marriage , it s very important for a man to be able to support his family financially just say the same about a woman the rise of cohabitation as marriage has declined , cohabitation or living together as unmarried partners has become more widespread , nearly doubling since , according to the census bureau in the pew research survey , of all adults and more than half of all adults ages to say they have cohabited at some point in their lives among those who have done so , about two thirds say they thought of this living arrangement as a step toward marriage the impact on children the share of births to unmarried women has risen dramatically over the past half century , from in to in there are notable differences by race among black women giving birth in , were unmarried this compares with of hispanic women giving birth and of white women overall , the share of children raised by a single parent is not as high as the share born to an unwed mother , but it too has risen sharply to in , up from in the public believes children of single parents face more challenges than other children say a lot more challenges and another say a few more challenges survey respondents see even more challenges for children of gay and lesbian couples say they face a lot more challenges and children of divorce say they face a lot more challenges in marriage , love trumps money far more married adults say that love , making a lifelong commitment and companionship are very important reasons to get married than say the same about having children or financial stability unmarried adults order these items the same way however , when asked if they agree that there is only one true love for every person , fewer than three in ten survey respondents say , i do while you might argue that marriage is not obsolete , these findings do highlight significant shifts in our cultural views about marriage and family life that are quite revealing full pew report time magazine article
