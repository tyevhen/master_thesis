i ran miles yesterday i ran miles yesterday , and i can still walk today i ran miles yesterday , and the last miles were all under minutes per mile i was n't trying to do that it just happened to qualify for boston , i need to run per mile for miles as of yesterday , i am feeling a whole lot better about my chances to do just that ! although , even as i write that statement , i cringe per mile would have been a cake walk a few years back stop it ! stop it ! stop focusing on that ! let go of the past ! shut up , shut up , shut up ! focus on this huge achievement and what it means today , you doh doh ! okay , i'm back sorry about the interruption yesterday i had n't intended to run that fast i had a pit stop and i do n't mean for coffee around miles that put me well behind the running group i spent the next miles trying to catch everyone else and make it to the water stops before the volunteers closed shop by miles in , my catch up pace sort of morphed into my relaxed pace i knew i was running too fast for a long , slow , distance run , but i was comfortable , so i went with it i stopped looking at my watch and let my body dictate the pace i rarely knew what mile i was running i never knew my pace , or how long i had been running i ran alone the entire way it was a beautiful , cool and sunny day i just let my body go what a relief ! i was free these are the moments we runners agonize , sweat and suffer for moments when our legs feel strong , our minds let us go , and our lungs are just along for the ride when i finished , i could barely believe my eyes i averaged just over minutes per mile for the entire distance and finished in just over hours i even felt relatively fresh it was a good run it was a good day and i'm really , really happy about it ! the marathon is less than weeks away
