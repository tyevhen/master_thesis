i'm being sardonic with that headline , obviously , but i have to agree with tim bray , who said in passing the other day i just don t believe that enterprise software , as currently priced , has much future , in the near term anyhow i take this to mean that the days of the seven figure software deal involving ibm , oracle , emc , open text , etc may not exactly be over , but certainly those kinds of sales are going to be vanishingly rare , going forward i would take bray 's statement a step further , though he 's speaking to the high cost of enterprise software itself or at least that 's how i interpret his statement enterprise systems take a lot of manpower to build and maintain the budget for a new system rollout tends to break out in such a way that the software itself represents only to percent of the overall cost in other words , software cost is a relatively minor factor therefore i would extend bray 's comment to say that old school big budget enterprise software projects involving a cast of thousands , months of development and testing , seven figure software services deals , etc , are on the way out in its place ? existing systems ! legacy systems will be maintained , modified , built out as necessary and only as necessary using agile methodologies , high productivity tools and languages i e , scripting , restful apis , and things that make economic sense there 's no room any more for technologies and systems that are n't provably and majorly cost effective ibm , oracle , emc , listen up million dollar white elephants are on the endangered species list
