after a very long day of travel yesterday , i finally arrived into a very wet , windy , and cold richmond , virginia , last night the recent hurricane deposited days of rain right over the top of the east coast as i awaited the holiday inn shuttle , i began an inventory of my suitcase not nearly enough cold weather gear in there ! after all , the last time i checked the weather , it said it was going to be up to degrees on saturday ! damn ! the holiday inn shuttle , which i had arranged literally hours earlier , did not show up that should have been my first clue i arrived at a hotel which looked nice on the surface , but the place was dirty and broken beneath besides the lack of promised amenities like a refrigerator and microwave there was a dirty rag hanging over my shower rod , my heater was busted , the card key worked only of the time , and the place was woefully understaffed i spent the night , but today i'm transferring to a comfort inn down the street i will certainly think twice before staying at another holiday inn so it 's been a rough start to my trip they say the rain is going to stop today god , i hope so ! it looks like it may be just warm enough for my attire , but i will be looking for some clothing deals at today 's expo i'm hoping to get checked into my new digs early , get quickly through the expo , go for a short run , and then spend the rest of the day relaxing i need to get back into the mental groove of marathon prep and put these recent stresses behind me hopefully , things will get smoother from here on out the gun goes off at am eastern time tomorrow morning !
