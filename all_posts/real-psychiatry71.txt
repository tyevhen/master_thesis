i woke up to a scary story about diet soda several days ago at least i thought it was scary it was clear at some point the the reporter had lost track of what the story was all about and was talking about regular and diet soda as being interchangeably toxic i can see how that might happen , since most of the recent soda scares have focused on regular soda or as it is referred to sugary soda sugar is the current hysteria and it must be eliminated the media routinely informs us that for years cholesterol and fat were vilified and now we have that all wrong fat and cholesterol are now acceptable and sugar is the villain to complicate matters , the message is to consume large quantities of colorful fruits and vegetables servings a day the problem is those colorful fruits on a serving per serving basis generally contain as much sugar as sugary soda the latest story was presented as they all are a news headline rather than a work in progress news flash drink diet soda and you will get alzheimer 's disease or a stroke in fact drink as little as can per day and get a stroke a few news outlets , talked about the other part of the story consuming those sugary drinks in the same study did not increase the risk for dementia or stroke but even then it was presented in way to keep the hysteria going that does not mean you should start drinking those sugary soft drinks ? really why not ? you just told me they do n't cause strokes or alzheimer 's disease oh that 's right they contain that well known toxin sugar time for some self disclosure in the interest of transparency before i get to the real story i eat a lot of sugary foods i like just about every imaginable kind of desert i am generally averse to vegetables unless they have a starchy consistency i have consumed massive amounts of soda and diet soda in my life time i realize that everybody has a story of the outlier who beat the food and health odds grandpa smoked two packs of cigarettes a day and died at of old age or grandpa ate raw bacon every day and died at of old age that is not my point here as a physician , more than anybody i know better than to challenge medical common sense and hope to survive it i happen to be a health nut who consumes junk food i do n't eat meat , fat or cholesterol and i exercise a lot if i had to guess where the proclivity for sweet consumption comes in i would attribute it to the scandinavian side of my genome cookies , pies , cakes , donuts with coffee of course so i am not here to defend or vilify sugar or artificial sweeteners in fact , i would definitely try my hardest to stop consuming this stuff if it was really a biohazard with that self disclosure , the real story in this case is easy to find and publicly accessible there is not only the original research article but an editorial to keep myself honest , i wrote about the article without reading the editorial first but did read it the original article and the editorial are references and respectively and full text is available one of the associations i automatically have when dealing with food headlines is the framingham study this study was big when i was in medical school it offered the first exposure to epidemiology and risk factor analysis in cardiovascular pathology that was built on in the epidemiology course where several of the professors were experts there were board exam questions based on a knowledge of this study generations of physicians have studied papers based on this study and probably react to the cardiovascular risk factor headlines the same way that i do i was mildly surprised to see that this study of diet soda and sugar sweetened drinks was based on the framingham study in this case the researchers looked at the framingham heart study offspring cohort that study began in with volunteers the participants are studied in examination cycles about every years to date that means there have been cycles so far with the last one occurring in for the purpose of this study , they looked at the year risk of stroke and dementia beginning with the th cycle a total of subjects were available at exam and completed the food frequency questionnaire ffq that population was split based on age and other criteria to an arm that was to be analyzed for year risk of of incident stroke n and another arm that was to be sampled for year risk of incident dementia the ffq was used to determine total sugary beverage consumption , sugary sweetened soft drink , and artificially sweetened soft drink in various rates of consumption where one can or bottle equaled one drink answers at exam cycle were used to measure recent intake and averaged responses over exams , , and were used to calculate cumulative intake over years this was a prospective study , so time to stroke or dementia using standard definitions was done over the next ten years from examination cycle the total number of events form the article are listed below the article contains tables detailing all of the demographic details by cohort and by consumption of sugary or artificially sweetened drinks the authors also present year survival curves for both the stroke and dementia cohorts about of the sample drank at least artificially sweetened drink per week with drinking more than one per day stroke cohort total events all strokes ischemic stroke recent intake n cumulative intake n dementia cohort total events all cause dementia alzheimer s disease recent intake n cumulative intake n the main finding was that consumption of any amount of artificially sweetened soft drinks was associated with risk of stroke in both the case of recent hr and cumulative intake hr drinking greater than or equal to artificially sweetened soft drink was associated with increased risk of all cause hr and alzheimer 's dementia hr but only in the cumulative intake mode they controlled for two major variables hypertension and diabetes mellitus are immediately relevant for both strokes and dementia controlling for diabetes mellitus , intake of artificially sweetened beverages remained a significant predictor of stroke , all cause dementia and alzheimer 's dementia but diabetes was found to be a partial mediator of the effect excluding people with hypertension decreased the effect of artificially sweetened drinks on all strokes this was a very well done prospective study the hrs for artificially sweetened soda and stroke risk appear to be robust nearly doubling the rate across the board there is also a dose related effect with the hrs for subjects drinking day artificially sweetened drink being a greater rate than those drinking drinks week for dementia , significant hrs were noted only for cumulative intake of day the authors do a good job of listing the limitations of the study they point out that there were no ethnic minorities and that limits generalizability to populations of non european decent while that is true , it may also be true that the study is not generalizable to other white populations they provide the usual disclaimer about causality from observational studies they discuss recall bias on the ffq , but they previously discussed validity of recall of coke pepsi product in the range of they mentioned undetermined confounding variables they also did not adjust for multiple comparisons which is surprising in a study with this many variables that seemed to be the weakest methodological link when i thought a bit more about the study , there was no clear mechanism of why strokes and dementia would be produced by artificial sweeteners they discuss theories about how these compounds have been implicated as increasing cardiometabolic risk factors the other factor is that several of these compounds have been consumed by the public for over years the fda provides information that some of the compounds have been extensively studied for safety in both animals and humans is it possible that the fda missed some excessive cardiovascular , cerebrovascular or dementia mortality due to high intensity sweeteners ? their approach seems to be to suggest an average daily intake adi of these compounds and suggest that consuming that amount over the course of a lifetime is safe the other main factor that affects how physicians think about these studies is whether or not there is supporting or contradictory data this paper lists the nurses professional and health professionals follow up study that showed that both artificially sweetened and sugar sweetened soft drinks were both associated with a higher risk of stroke over years of follow up for women and years of follow up for men the sample size was large women n and men n the pooled relative risk of stroke was and the authors suggest drinking decaffeinated coffee reduced risk the authors also listed the northern manhattan study n that showed that artificially sweetened soda increased the combined risk of vascular events but not stroke in the editorial , the authors list two negative studies in the first , there was an association between coronary heart disease and biomarkers of coronary heart disease for sugar sweetened beverages but not artificially sweetened beverages the second study showed the identical result with risk for sugar sweetened but not artificially sweetened beverages i am always skeptical of the results of studies with many variables and clear cut effects at least until they are replicated this is a good study that will be quoted for years you ca n't believe what you hear in the media about it but to physicians and researchers it raises significant questions i think that it is useful to known this literature in order to discuss it with people who need to take specific medications that increase their cardiometabolic risk like atypical antipsychotics at a personal level , the question is what if anything should be done ? it is clear that although the study points to increased risk , the majority of the research subjects who ingested diet soda did not experience an adverse outcome during the test period doing a basic literature search shows that there are many epidemiological studies looking for various adverse outcomes from artificial sweetener exposure and few positive findings i will take it as a sign that i need to get more disciplined in terms of my intake of high intensity sweeteners as well as sugar why take something toxic if there is even a theoretical risk ? the answer of course is preferences over time and those preferences die hard wish me luck george dawson , md , dfapa references pase mp , himali
