in instructing poetry students over the years , i evolved a teaching device called a chinese brush experiment , or cbe in it the student can only write forwards , never backwards , just as the skilled chinese brush artist gets no forgiveness for his brush whatever goes forward , stays , so that in a poem , one can only go back to change punctuation , spelling , grammar , and to push the envelope , i suppose line breaks but not the essential text i propose the same exercise for my blog this morning and it is morning here , am pst i dozed off earlier only to awaken again to a burst of energy , which enabled me to get the wash together , take a closet door off in the bedroom , clean out a cabinet in the kitchen , take out the compost and do various other domestic tasks that happily consume my time at odd hours we live in an apx square foot cottage , and it is my ambition to close out or modest storage unit , to have all worldly possessions under this one roof i am close to achieving said ambition , as storage is mostly empty now , and i need only go through the guest bedroom reducing possessions in order to accomodate things from storage i wish yet to keep , like my simpsons memorabilia when the simpsons debuted i knew television was marked forever the show was too smart , usually a death knell , but it appealed on so many levels that it 's now gone on for over twenty years , the longest adult cartoon ever to grace our screens not anticipating this , thinking that for the intelligence of the show its lifespan would be short , i began collecting simpsons memorabilia early on i thought , like the famous mickey mouse phone , that any trinket i collected was sure to become a collector 's item but paah ! after twenty years all the stuff has no value , at least on e bay because the show 's still going on yet i insist on keeping what i collected i used to think it would be my grandchild 's college fund now i think it 's just god laughing at me but i wo n't give up the collection so i must make room in the guest bedroom for storage , and it will not prove too hard i'm just not ready to undertake it yet today today i have other concerns , one of which is novel for a bachelor my wife is away at present i plan to actually wash the sheets and afterwards put fresh sheets on our bed , something i do n't think i 've ever done , since as a bachelor i used to simply sleep on a futon with no sheets or in a sleeping bag on the floor today will mark a first , i think in fact , since my spiritual transformation on august rd , i can actually see dust a man who can see dust a man who can see dust and changes the sheets on the bed this is not a miracle ? women of america , rise up and affirm that for a man , a straight man at that , that this is indeed a miracle ! i 've been working my way through mozart 's late string quartets and found a space in the kv s ref for mozart fans only where he tends to merge long sustained interludes in and out of another in a continuous unwinding , and it is quite hypnotic see kv for an example i watched the world series game last night with friends and one thing i like about watching baseball is that it allows for much conversation and analysis for the opposite reason i love basketball , because it allows for so little , given the constant action save the interminable time outs and free throws thank god the nba season has begun go lakers ! and , with nothing more profound to say , putting his brush away , he signed off namaste , craig
