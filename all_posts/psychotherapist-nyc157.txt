misconceptions see my article talking to your young child about your divorce this is why you and your spouse want to be on the same page about how to approach your child , choosing the right time and keeping it simple here are some basic suggestions get together with your spouse beforehand and present a united front even though you and your spouse might not be getting along , you both need to put aside your differences for your child 's sake you might be relieved that the marriage will soon be over , but expect that your child probably will be upset about it , even if she witnessed the marital conflicts decide in advance what you will say and keep it as simple as possible if your child asks why you 're getting divorced , you can say something simple like , we 're not getting along , but do n't say , we do n't love each other anymore because this could lead to your child thinking that , at some point , you might not love her anymore choose the right time and place and leave plenty of time for this talk choose a time when it 's quiet and you 'll have privacy to talk also allot enough time for your child 's questions or emotional reactions this is n't the kind of talk you want to have with your child in a car , in a public place , before your child goes to school or just before you go to work remain calm and bring forth your best self you and your spouse need to summon your most mature and best selves to have this conversation this is n't the time to blame your spouse or for your spouse to blame you for things that have n't worked out or to express your grievances about the marriage it 's also not the time to try to get your child to side with you reassure your child that it is n't her fault it 's very important to assure your child that the breakup of your relationship is n't her fault young children are naturally egocentric during the early stage of their development and it 's normal for a child to blame herself for the divorce it 's also very important to let her know that , even though the marriage will be over , you each will love her always and she 'll be safe talking to your young child about your divorce explain what the living and visitation arrangements will be once again , due to the early stage of a young child 's development , your child will naturally be concerned about where she will live you need to explain the living and visitation arrangements to your child in a simple way anticipate other questions do n't assume that your child is okay just because she 's not reacting depending upon your child 's personality and level of maturity , she may or may not react immediately do n't assume that everything is okay because she 's quiet although she is quiet , there can still be a lot going on in her mind that she 's not expressing , so you might need to elicit questions or concerns during and after the initial talk anticipate that your child might regress or act out after the talk it 's not unusual for a child to regress to an earlier stage of development after you and your spouse talk about the divorce young children usually do n't have the communication skills to express their feelings , so their upset is often expressed through a regression or through acting out a child of five or six might start wetting the bed or start using baby talk or feel the need to be treated like a baby again this usually passes , but if it does n't speak with your pediatrician and explain what 's going on acting out could take the form of testing limits , like refusing to do homework or suddenly not want to go to school speaking of school , your child 's academic performance and behavior in school might become problematic , so you want to remain in contact with the school try to be as compassionate as you can be and recognize that your child might need further reassurance that she 's going to be okay and that you and your spouse will each be okay talking to your young child about your divorce check in with your child from time to time after the talk it often takes young children a while to absorb all the implications of how she will be affected by the divorce , so it 's best to check in with your child from time to time anticipate that she might try to bargain with the two of you to try to get you to stay together , so you might have to explain it to her again , keeping it simple try not to worry too much most children are resilient although it 's normal for your child to be sad , disappointed or angry about the divorce , over time , most children are resilient and eventually bounce back , especially if you and your spouse can be respectful of one another and have an amicable relationship when it comes to the welfare of your child change can be challenging for anyone , especially children , who need structure and routine , but most children adjust to new routines , especially if they know what to expect if your child is having an especially difficult time , consider taking
