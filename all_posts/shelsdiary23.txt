'sunday was sad i cried a lot i cried for never hanging out with him again , no more gorgeous kisses , no more lovely sex i cried for that horrible feeling of rejection , for history repeating itself and my wasted heart i cried because i felt a fool , that i 'd made fantasised all this up i thought he cared about me i cried for being and dumped , but not dumped because we were never together i cried for him because he was giving up on something i knew could have been amazing '
