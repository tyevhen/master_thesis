i'm still settling back into life after my chaotic , stressful trip to new york my mood did take a hit the last couple of days have been a little rough , but i think things are beginning to smooth out i'm feeling better today i worked hard to avoid sliding any further into the darkness i ran miles fast and hard both friday and saturday i do n't usually run two days in a row , but it was necessary to battle the impending doom both runs helped boost my mood i also attended a couple of aa meetings and surrounded myself with positive people even though i did n't feel like it the meetings helped get me out of myself for a little while i needed that i spent most of today alone the day started slow , and i actually went back to bed an hour after getting up but then i went to the gym to lift some weights later , while watching football , i opened my accumulated mail and paid some bills puck and i went for a chilly walk i took care of the trash pick up , made my lunch for tomorrow , and already set out my clothes these were all little things , but i was focused on taking little steps today i just wanted to keep moving forward , and i think that helped i'm anxious about returning to work while not feeling in tip top shape i know i 'll likely feel better once i'm there i actually begin a new work schedule this week , which is another unknown entity creating some anxiety i 'll now be splitting my time between two buildings , and i added day , tuesday afternoons , to my schedule those extra hours will certainly help me out we 'll see how i handle working on what 's typically been a day off one thing is for sure , i'm anxious about a lot tonight i'm going to say a few prayers to relieve me of my fears and anxiety after all , i'm not doing myself any good sitting here worrying tomorrow will come soon enough , and then i can face my fears rather than write about them i think getting back into the full swing of my routine will help settle me
