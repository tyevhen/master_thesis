the hallmark of neurosis for me is the loss of freedom and the impossibility of gaining it back because unfulfilled need makes us obsessive and compulsive and deprives us of choice so we have to drink , take drugs , work so hard , eat so much , unable to rest you fill in the blanks we have reduced our choices and narrowed our perspective we lead more superficial , narrow lives lives bereft of feeling because feeling has been buried along with our basic need we keep having broken relationships , brief rapports , truncated love affairs because we started out in life like that inconsistent love , sporadic affection , parents leaving we are prisoners of these patterns because we have no idea as to the why of it all we are on automation acting out unthinkingly a continuous , repetitive behavior that we utterly cannot control it controls us and what is it ? need , deprived need that keeps in the unceasing quest for fulfillment always symbolic since it is far too late for love from them so we get it from professors , bosses , partners , foremen , wives , husbands , friends but we never get it and the task goes on ad nauseum we never get it because the critical window is closed it is over , done with , finished getting that love is no longer possible the love as that little baby that is why some women want sex all of the time they need to be touched like that baby it was why some of us seek approval over and over to try to get that tyrannical judgmental parent to see the good in us , and above all to say a simple but evasive sentence you are really good that simple sentence might avoid a lifetime of seeking approval but ah no ! we first get involved with those very critical people and then try to make them approving otherwise it would be too easy we as neurotics never go straight for love we take the parental route , circuitous we re create our childhood again and then try for love ay ay ay we are prisoners of pain we create our prison and then spend a lifetime getting out of it we travel the world over trying to find the real home we never had we idealize the women we meet and do not see who they really are until reality sets in slowly over much time another divorce locked into divorce and broken relationships if only we had access to our feelings we could get involved with decent , normal , non neurotic people and be able to stay and grow old together we could give our partners love and be able to feel their love usually , it is the opposite we don t want real love , we want a mother or a father , someone to take care of us , indulge us and give into our whims when there is no old imprinted need we can stop acting out the past , trying to get something from our history and accept the love that may be there now if we are totally narcissistic we may want total approval , total indulgence and total acceding to our wishes that is not always easy to find but the one who is totally into herself or himself never stops trying and they discard what little love there is for them they look past love to the struggle , the struggle to get more and more of what no longer exists
