a few weeks ago when my anxiety flared up after two years of silence , i was able to get it to calm down after a few days however since then it has been popping up again and again a panic attack while out at lunch with my sisters , and now i have the morning anxiety again the last two days in a row although i do n't usually post horrible pictures of myself up for viewing , i thought this was an exception because even though i am smiling for the camera , i am sick as a dog and feeling like i am going to lose it any second the anxiety just hit me super hard and it took leaving the restaurant for it to finally go away this has me contemplating going back on medication are you trying to decide if medication is right for you ? according to the book the best ever anxiety management techniques by margaret wehrengerg , if you can answer yes to any of the following questions , you may be helped by medication are you having panic attacks a few times a week or more ? my experience with people who have panic disorder leads me to think that if people are having attacks that frequently , they might benefit from medication their brains may be so agitated that it will take some time to calm the panic it may thus be too discouraging to get their thoughts and behavior in control without the help of medication are you able to push aside ruminating worry when you have something important to concentrate on but find yourself worrying again the minute you have nothing to focus on ? you may do okay without medication , but if it is a huge effort or you cannot draw your attention away from worry even for short times , medications are in order do you feel sick to your stomach with dread much of the time and find it interferes with eating and sleeping ? if so , you will probably respond better to anxiety management techniques with the help of medication , because this level of distress should be interrupted as quickly as possible having an agitated brain without relief is not good for your emotional or physical self do you immediately flush , have shaky legs , a quivering voice , and a palpitating heart even at the thought that someone might watch you leave a theater , watch you speak up at a business meeting , or observe you ordering food or eating in a restaurant ? you might benefit from using medication on an as needed basis while trying techniques to get over those signs of social anxiety do you feel so terrified of attending a party or being in a busy public place like a shopping mall , airport , or school that you refuse to go ? you will probably benefit the most from a combination of medication and treatment methods , because this is about the most difficult situation in which to calm yourself medication will allow you to focus on using new anxiety controlling skills and social skills that will help you in your interactions with others because i am answering yes to almost every single one of these , i have decided that i am going to go back on zoloft i know some of you may think that 's a mistake , but i know my body and my mind and now that i am no longer nursing i think i need the additional help to make my days feel more normal i am tired of feeling sick and scared all the time because of the side effects i felt the last time i got on zoloft , i am not sure when i should actually start taking it i have the weekend to figure it out since it wo n't be until monday before i can even see the doctor i hope this helps you to figure out what is best for you in your situation as always , your doctor can probably give you the best advice if you enjoyed this post get the reality of anxiety via rss or email
