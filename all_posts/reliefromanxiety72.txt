anxiety a half life i am thirty years old and i have had anxiety since i was fifteen i m assuming there must have been some kind of trigger but i ve never been able to pin it down to one specific moment in my life perhaps that s not important anyway anxiety feeling out of control but having to be in control it s being afraid but being unable to name the fear i have had anxiety for fifteen years but it feels like forever , i can t remember how it feels not to have anxiety anymore and i m terrified this will always be my life for the last ten years i have been agoraphobic , for six months out of those ten years i couldn t leave my bedroom , for the last two years i was making progress , getting out with my husband , visiting family i even made it on a bus ! but then three months ago i was in town with my mum and had a big panic attack , you know the kind where you think you re going to pass out and be sick ? lovely ! as you can imagine i was devastated , it was the first time anxiety had made me go back home in two years and since then i ve been struggling to do the things i was doing so well at walking the dogs , going out to town with a friend so i did what i should have done a long time ago i asked for help i had done this once before in my old town but the mental health service was less than helpful i was basically told if you can t get in to see us we can t help you not very helpful for someone suffering with agoraphobia ! luckily the new county i live in has an excellent mental health service and i was put on medication , which after a bit of trial and error began to work and appointments were made for me to begin cbt which best of all could be done over the phone ! i have been on fluoxetine for a month now and so far i ve had cbt three times i ve learnt that when i thought i was doing well i actually wasn t because i was using safety behaviours such as my mp , bottle of water , tissues and always having someone with me which meant i wasn t letting my brain deal with or learn how to cope with anxiety so now i go out every day without any safety behaviours , so far i can only get to the top of my street but it s such an achievement for me and my therapist is really happy with my progress my next aim is to get to the shops by myself and then i ll be going in a shop , alone for the first time in far too long ! it s hard and it s horrible because the only way you can get over it is by letting yourself feel the anxiety which is the hardest thing in the world it s like if someone was scared of snakes and the only way for them to get over the fear was to stand in a bucket of snakes for one hour but will it be worth it ? yes ! mary hoyle tree trunk hotmail co uk
