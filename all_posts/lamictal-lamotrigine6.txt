yesterday afternoon we had to say goodbye to piglet , our loving and faithful kitty of years she was a real sweetheart she was always there for me when i needed comforting if she were here now she 'd be on my lap purring and letting me cry into my fur losing a pet just sucks part of it is the lack of understanding on the part of non pet owners they may be sympathetic , but in a lot of cases you can see that in the back of their minds they 're thinking , it 's just an animal it 's their loss it also sucks that animals ca n't tell us how they 're feeling i do n't know if piglet was in pain in her last days for that matter , i do n't know why she was n't eating for the last two months i could n't ask her what was going on , whether there was a food she wanted or could tolerate , or where the discomfort was the biggest part of the suckage , though , is the foreknowledge of the loss i wished so much that piglet would just stop breathing and peacefully slip away i hated calling and making an appointment for her death knowing that we had until pm to spend time with our cat was a hard thing on the other hand , her last few hours were clearly hard , so it was also a relief when the vet showed up that also sucked now i go back to a life where i'm not spending half my time and energy feeding my cat i have to adjust to not having her in the house if she were her right now , she 'd be in my lap , purring , letting me dry my tears in her fur my other cat , cc , has a shit ton of personality , but sweetness and comfort are n't really in it i lost the most comforting thing in my life yesterday and there are no two ways about it it just sucks
