i was notified yesterday by the website healthline com that they have chosen my little blog as one of their best for i 've been similarly honored previously , but it always amazes me when it happens of course i hope people who find my blog enjoy it and even gain new information or perspective from it , but when i compare my small effort to some of the other depression blogs out there , i rarely feel i measure up for example , most of them have twitter accounts and facebook pages ! i guess i'm a bit behind in the whole social media realm i'm lucky i can figure out how to add pictures to my own blog posts nevertheless , i am extremely honored and grateful for the healthline com recognition if you are here for the first time , welcome to depression marathon enjoy your visit and a big thank you , to my regular readers and healthline com , for your continued support
