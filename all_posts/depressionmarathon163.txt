i 've had a bit of a tough week of course , i'm still recovering from my achilles surgery and while i'm not having physical pain , just some soreness , being immobilized in a walking boot prevents me from doing the crucial exercise i need to prevent mental pain i'm doing what i can , but i feel a mental heaviness settling in i'm a little worried about that i am unfortunately not without physical pain i'm still recovering from my oral surgery and some follow up orthodontic work , which has been quite painful even today , days later , i'm having trouble chewing and very sore all the time i 've come to believe oral pain has got to be one of the worst types of pain there is really no way to rest your mouth , and you gotta eat ! , which just aggravates the pain over and over again i'm trying to be patient and hang in there i know it will eventually get better i returned to work this week i was looking forward to getting out of my house and seeing patients again i was really looking forward to getting out of myself instead , i was met with a pile of paperwork that did n't get done while i was away , as my supervisor did n't find anyone to replace me while i was gone i spent three days completing overdue documentation on patients i barely knew or in some cases had n't even seen it was frustrating i was frustrated with my supervisor besides the paperwork issue , another situation arose where i felt like i was n't being treated fairly in fact , i felt like i was being taken for granted that 's an icky feeling and it forced me to have a pair of difficult conversations with my supervisor i simply had to stand up for myself standing up for myself , while necessary , is rarely comfortable it 's almost always challenging i was already feeling challenged working in a walking boot with a very painful mouth the last thing i wanted to do was have a difficult sit down with my boss i contemplated ignoring the situation , but not addressing it certainly would have resulted in an energy sucking resentment i ca n't afford resentments they are poisonous to my mental health it took me a few days and at least one sleepless night , but i did have a respectful conversation with my supervisor yesterday we had a good discussion , and i said what i wanted to say things were clarified i'm still not entirely happy with the situation , but i accept it my acceptance does not require my agreement , but acceptance frees me from resentment and allows me to move on i'm glad i stood up for myself because i already feel better letting go and moving on is crucial for my mental health as i move through this next week i'm hoping to shed the looming mental heaviness and be freed from more of my physical pain those are the goals one day at a time one day at a time
