recovery takes patience and , i believe i have mentioned several times over the years that patience is a virtue i do not possess the broken metatarsal and sprain are now the most painful injury the ligaments in the left hyperflexed knee are still sore , but manageable i am thankful for the toradol injection nsaid it is a wonder drug on my opinion because it worked wonders on me if it wasn t for that , i can t imagine what the recovery process would have been like i miss performing my standing leg exercises every morning yet , i know the healing process takes time i haven t slowed on my upper body exercises and i continue to do most of my sitting leg exercises this provides a certain level of satisfaction on wednesday i began performing side to side weight shifts every couple of hours i do shifts at a time it is nothing like my step in place exercises or standing leg lifts , but it is a start if it weren t for the metatarsal damage , i believe i could do the step in place exercises did i mention patience somewhere in the paragraph above ? my latest affirmation is , do no harm reminding myself of this every few hours helps , especially when i want to try something crazy dumb
