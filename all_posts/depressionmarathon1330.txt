if only i had a nice , socially acceptable illness , i would n't be treated like a pile of shit if hallmark recognized my illness , the vocational services professional and i use that term loosely looking down from across his desk would n't have interrupted me and asked , so when you say you 'got sick' what does that mean , are you bipolar , do you hear voices no , like i said , i have unipolar depression i replied so , you take some sort of medication , he sneered ? yes are you com pli ant ? his tone was decidedly un hallmark like , and i was seething internally ! i was trying to maintain a cordial , professional demeanor , but i wanted to scream at him ! if he had bothered to look at me with open eyes or listen with open ears , it should have been obvious there was no need for that demeaning question ! i 've worked in his field i 've been in his chair it is after noticing certain signs and symptoms that one should ask a person that question and ask it out of concern not cocksureness but rather than scream , i quietly stated , my first career was mental health i was a master 's level clinician i rarely pull that card from the deck , but in this situation i believed it was my best move oh , he said , as he leaned back in his chair so what you 're telling me is you know all about this stuff yes , i stated like i said , i did n't get sick until years ago november , we were back where we had started so why are you here , he asked again ? to make a long story short , i began explaining , again , that i was on disability because of my depression and no longer able to work full time i told him the unpredictability of my illness made it difficult even to predict success in a regular part time position i noted that most employers do n't allow their employees to nap in the middle of the day ! since his organization provided funding for disabled people seeking job training or developing businesses , i briefly described my ideas about creating a home based internet business the effort was futile i was talking uphill the entire time and repeatedly interrupted with questions such as , who said you could n't work ? and comments like , well we only have x amount of dollars where are you going to get the rest ? in the seconds it took for me to amble from his office door to my interrogation chair , this bureaucrat had figured me out , or so he thought before i even sat down , he knew who i was based on my diagnosis alone prior to opening my mouth , mr it 's my job to help people return to work concluded that i was a malingering , lazy , manipulative consumer , and i was only there to steal funds from other , more deserving victims of real illnesses i did n't have a chance
