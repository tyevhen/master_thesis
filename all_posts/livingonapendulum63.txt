hello all , just dropping by to let you all know i have not forgotten you indeed i am posting less these days there are a few different reasons for that i have already complained about most of the things that i need to complain about i do n't want to keep constantly spinning the same broken record when my life keeps throwing the same old lemons at me and i run out of sugar to make lemonade , i do n't have much to say my computer monitor is dead i can at times make a quick facebook update before it goes black but not much more my son 's laptops are dead and my daughter 's computer set up is not comfortable enough to write a post then at work , well , i only have my breaks and lunch i do n't always have the time to write a post because there is so much more that needs to be done i need to wait till this summer to improve the at home computer situation finances are much too tight between now and then a good friend has offered to loan me a monitor , was even willing to bring it to me last weekend , but i was not available at that time i will see about next weekend , maybe go to them hope the monitor works on my computer spring makes life busier , but unfortunately , so far is not making me have more energy in fact with the wonderfully unstable weather we are having lately , i have less spoons to work with also , i have been thinking lately of giving my blog a new direction with the new house , i have all kinds of decoration ideas maybe the blog could become a diary of sorts of all these changes i will or plan on making oh i know there are already a lot of craft renovation blogs out there ! most are probably better than i could ever hope to be , however , part of the point my blog would be to motivate me to get things done if i know that every week i must have some new project to write about with pictures of course maybe it will help me find that little something i am missing to get things done i already have a list of things that needs to get done paint the dining room walls and the cabinet this may be two projects paint the kitchen cabinets into a nice country colour creme ? light blue ? some other colour ? i 'll need to get tester jars and paint a carboard and tack them onto my cabinets and see what looks best do something about the backsplash i have been wanting a backsplash in the kitchen since forever but this one is a little ugly and out dated i have thought of smart tiles on top , i also thought of ceramic paint the paint would probably be more work but less expensive paint the tables in the living room , make them spiffy paint the downstairs washroom in a colour other than pink , maybe get a little creative and do a mario bros theme paint my son 's room i am thinking of painting the living room too , maybe just a wall or two make the entryway organized and interesting then there is the lanscappiong , the gardening what do you think ? thanks for reading
