my return to work has been so far fairly uninteresting for anyone , including myself sunday to monday night i barely slept , i was so so very nervous i go up extra early to start getting ready and wound up watching tv for a few hours i get to work and i get a lot of uncomfortable questions from people like how are you ? and are you happy to be back ? my boss tried to cage the extend of my limitations by asking question about what kind of activities involve stressful reactions duh , the letter said so , i ca n't take calls i can do anything that does n't involve having to deal with people people are my stressors he does n't need to know that i have social phobia he needs to know that i have a medical reason for avoiding taking calls from irate or difficult clients i mentioned to him that the job description which was being used was very out of date and did not include the new program or the increased back up anyway , so for the week i was given very little to do , which was good on friday but not the other days on friday , i was sick i could barely stay awake at work , i could not read or focus for the life of my and was scared driving home in the freezing rain feeling like that when i got home i crashed for the next hours almost i did wake up to give medications to a cat i am currently babysitting , take my pills but otherwise , i slept and was pretty much out of it until saturday morning well that' it , thanks for reading you might also like do you believe in ghosts ? visit to the emergency living with the bipolar label linkwithin
