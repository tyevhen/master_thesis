i 've been working on a poem for awhile , unusual for me to plan out such a narrative it all began with a provence lavender that refused to change or bloom , unlike the lavenders i saw in everyone else 's yard yeah , the poem is a little long for a blog , but so are my usual postings you can ignore the poem if you wish and proceed to the next paragraph below , but i think it 's a fun read lavender boy it started as a lump out in the garden , a mound of lavender that never changed i planted it in may transplanting it did nothing by september no thin shoots had risen in violet efflorescence , the fine hairs of its silvery leaves speared dew for nothing where were all the purple standards gardeners expect ? seduced by vegetable melancholy , had it turned its attention from the sky to purely subterranean concerns ? my spade marked a wide circle around the stunted plant painstakingly i loosened earth six inches down , when the spade hit something solid i substituted fingers , pawing dirt with care , when the outline of two shoulders surfaced beneath my fingers recoiled what could it be ? dirt shook from a pale forehead , amethyst eyes opened with sagacious innocence i freed its hands and motioned it to help me but it wriggled them in self discovery , the way a baby looks at its hands three and a half feet down , its bluish feet sprouted like potatoes each rootlet i broke through made the whole thing quiver unearthed , it looked like a boy i feared to break his body like a carrot or bruise him like a melon by his armpits i lifted him gently as a slice of cake what stuff he was made of was moist and pliable he hardened when i stood him in the sun beside the zinnias i thought about gepetto what a beautiful boy ! his lips were pale violet , his hair was lavender that flowered wherever he displaced the air lavender filled the vacuum it seemed right to dress him in a suit of silver velvet with a frock collar he could gather blackberries all day without staining his finery only fires made him nervous i quit smoking because of it he drooped in the morning before his drink restored his turgor when i put him in the shower he swelled and sprouted beware of over watering , i thought he liked the water cool within a month he dressed himself but speech took longer toothless , he struggled with consonants and diphthongs he had a thin , melodious voice when he said chaos , i said gaia he grinned and said , uranus i said aphrodite we understood each other time passed and his limbs grew woody as perennials do it made him rough , he did n't like it , still he eschewed return to earth , said it would mar his sentience but i could see no future beyond a sachet for the closet , nothing to accommodate his soft , scented hands and fragile smile with tears i planted him again he asked nothing of me except to scent all my days with lavender since i put deer netting everywhere in my garden and turned up the sensitivity on my motion activated sprayer , i 've had no trouble except for gophers eating my potatoes , though i think there are potatoes left , at least judging by their above ground greenery we got a new dog after a year of mourning for kenyon , and he 's a fifteen pound whippersnapper sheba inu chihuahua mix , full of vim and vigor and bound to chew anything available down to the nub i have begun reading dog training books , have begun to try to think like a dog as a book by the monks of new skene suggests he can sit and stay and shake hands so far , but his staying power is less than ten feet kathleen and i have agreed he needs a crate for in house training we 're trying to get him on a regular schedule but it 's hard sorry , no picture yet our cats have deserted us since the dog 's acquisition did i tell you his name ? he looks so prim and proper , like an english gentleman , so we named him j alfred prufrock , j for short he likes to chase deer and points like a hunter despite his diminutive stature he also likes to chase moths in the air , making me suspect he might have some bird dog dna as i intimated , he 's not a cat friendly dog and topaz and jojo live outside now , coming to the porch at night for a feeding we ca n't let the cat food stand outside because of the crafty raccoons the cats look well fed but i do n't know if they 'll ever make friends with the dog he behaves just like a cartoon dog in relation to the cats on the literary front , besides having submitted my selected to a publisher that approached me , the anthology crazed by the sun is now out click on the title for more information in it i rub shoulders with e e cummings , theodore roethke , marianne moore , and many more contemporary poets like sandra macpherson i'm honored to be included my poem concerns attending a carnival with my youngest daughter , though that tells you virtually nothing about the poem if you 'd like to read it , here 's the link at the carnival i'm still in a lot of physical pain , thank god for celebrex but i could n't get by without the morphine as well my back is hurting more , a good sign that i might return to my chief chronic pain it all takes time some things heal , some things do n't , hard to tell why my back never has , though i have congenital defects to blame that on my left hand remains too weak and numb to play the guitar with any authority , but if i stick to open chords i can sneak by , concentrating on my voice i just finished my third mendocino circle of men 's retreat and i must say it was magical every year is it 's a privilege to be associated with such great men in spiritual solidarity and intentional ritual my chief insight this time around was that my life has always been a struggle partly , perhaps , because i was a forceps baby trying to claw my way out life does n't have to be that hard just because it began that way , but in my case it seems more like a prophecy the main thing is to try to stay in the river of being , to remind oneself that the hidden spiritual connection between all good men and women ultimately supersedes the daily grind we call life whatever your occupation , it is possible to stay in the river for periods , though we often find ourselves scattered on the shore of our own shortcomings have courage , the river can absorb it the river of being is always flowing , it 's our access that 's impaired so try to concentrate on the divine throughout your day and you will feel the difference take a deep breath and thank god for all the things you are and have , especially the love shown you by others you ca n't think yourself into the river , you can only notice when you 're in or out sometimes we enter it without thinking other times we ca n't imagine it really exists but it does the flow of god 's spirit is not constrained by any religion or viewpoint there is no dogma to qualify you except for a willing heart and an open mind may you dip in the river today kiloneutral , ce
