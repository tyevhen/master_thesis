hi friends ! happy monday ! chris let me have most of the weekend off so that i could get out and have some alone time it was fabulous ! on saturday , i started my first sewing lesson i 've been dying to learn to sew and a wonderful woman who lives in the next town over teaches classes we 're making a basic skirt i learned a lot but am still wondering how i 'll ever remember how to thread the darned machine the bobbin part is confusing to me it does n't help that my short term memory is horrible i see a lot of practice in my future i'm excited though ! sunday was spent getting a massage and then off to do some shopping to replace clothes that no longer fit on your advice , i hit up forever for some trendy things and then my favorite banana republic and jcrew for jeans and basic shirts things were on big time sale , so that was a good reason too it was a nice break to go out and about and not worry about rushing home for nap time or worrying about anything thanks chris ! you 're the best ! ! ! as always , i was happy to come home to you both here 's a photo of paige and me at the start of the weekend i look like poo , but it was first thing in the morning and paige was smiley save you might also like monday monday happy paige thank you linkwithin
