it s after pm and neither kathleen nor i nor kenyon has had a cigarette we ve taken our wellbutrin and slapped on our nicotine patches unfortunately , kenyon had no hairless place to put a patch , but unlike humans he has no power to obtain cigarettes without our help , so he ll just have to go cold turkey we quit last year from september through december but faltered on new year s , not from partying but from an emotional blowout with our son , the details of which i am not at liberty to share suffice it to say i wouldn t buy a used car from him , although he is a handsome and lovable young man further , today we were confirmed as new tenants in a spacious , light filled one bedroom house along a whispering creek in the redwoods if things progress as planned we ll actually be moving in next saturday having a place of our own as you may not be able to imagine if you have not been virtually homeless for well over a year is to us a scary prospect we will be pinching ourselves for weeks in gratitude and disbelief , and then , like all humans , we ll begin to take it for granted , and later aspire to a larger place such is our fallen nature for now we have a chance to be grateful instead of blogging for the next week , i invite you to come along on my journey of quitting smoking there will be a poem posted in parts with each blog rather than more prose accounting of our adventures i m also going to change key words in the description of my blog to garner more attention , like free sex and drugs please ignore that ploy i think those who have been cigarette addicts will enjoy the poem , and those who have not may gain compassion for our minority , especially in view of the new calabasas , california law that allows smokers to smoke in public only in their cars with the windows rolled up to defend free speech for nazis and the right to internet porn is all very well , but where is the aclu when it comes to smokers ? herein lies the ongoing puritan hypocrisy on which our nation was founded as for hypocrisy , think of george bush encouraging us to have private social security retirement accounts and private health care accounts while he and congress pile up a trillion dollars in debt yes , americans it is your responsibility to plan for the future while the benefits government promised you go down the toilet so kind of uncle sam to demand a virtue from the populace he cannot perform i have one word to prepare baby boomers for the upcoming crash of medicare and social security sacrifice ! this seems to be the one thing no one in america is prepared to do , especially our representatives as george harrison sang , i , me , mine now for today s installment of the deprivathon , a poem i admit i did not compose spontaneously i am revising an earlier draft from when i quit for six months in i want to thank jim zola for a critique of that earlier draft , my co editor for melic s last issue , who among a few others actually had the patience to read the whole thing in its earlier form happy no trails ! no fuming ! c e chaffin the deprivathon a diary of quitting smoking day i invocation nothing fills the body like tobacco gas sating each bronchiole until alveoli collapse like punctured bubble wrap , yet it is not the health risk but the slavery i address , the false comfort of filling augustine s god shaped vacuum have mercy , god , for without smoke my lungs are empty gloves , my chest an abandoned altar sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof this day by the grace of god i will not smoke ii howl how can i wax oracular about a deadly habit ? shall i say , i saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by white voodoo missiles from the military industrial suicidal tobacco coven , red man 's revenge funded by oil wealthy oklahoma indians , saw the blue smoke climb the undefended caves of their nostrils like mutated kudzu planting a manitou deep in their unsuspecting ribs to one day metastasize and waste their brains , the nobel prize is a green oxygen tank and a wheelchair ! o cancer ! o emphysema ! o stroke ! o coronary ! o insidious degenerative enzymes from secret hybrid leaves developed for mass destruction ! o refreshing salems in a waterfall among the green ferns ! o perfect models with sweaters tied around their necks and khaki slacks sailing off martha 's vineyard , liberated by newports ! o marlboro man who never talks but rides by purple mountains and orange sunsets in his fleece lined suede jacket ! o virginia slims who keep that weight off for a woman who is only a clothes rack for gay designers , tennis anyone ? o be happy , go lucky , winston tastes good , the pause that refreshes , smooth , smooth , smooth as polished agate hack hack but i'm not starving hysterical naked only addicted and i hate to smoke but hate not smoking more because inhaled nicotine jolts the brain in seven seconds , talk about a hydrogen jukebox , instantaneous pleasure loop ! it calms , suppresses appetite , grants euphoria , helps concentration , ask any student , nicotine works long after caffeine quits iii consequences mornings are made worse by alcohol at night which dulls the brain to pain of inhalation you wake up feeling like a crematorium , still have to have that morning rush or fear you won t awaken i can t ignore the pleading quality of machines a whir , a whine , as if a wish for petting , as if they wanted a cigarette addiction is a machine no addict can adequately apprehend , foresee or even imagine his actual end one of three they say will die from cigarettes but this is only pseudoscientific propaganda is easier to see the damage in finely furrowed faces , gray with sunken cheeks who purse their lips to exhale and afford increased resistance to move their palsied bellows these are the blue bloaters of emphysema there are also the barrel chested wheezing types who hyperventilate to compensate these are the pink puffers of chronic bronchitis i learned these facts in medical school where i took up smoking as a tool to study past the point where caffeine fails but my excuse is only a denial of death yet emphysema , chronic bronchitis , the risk of stroke and heart attack do not terrify like the black crab of cancer , lung cancer patients stink no one wants to play with them on the field or at the rink , no one wants to stay with them cancer is more feared because more alien a thing inside composed of altered cells , cells you were never born with , cells not yourself , that mutating manitou within that killed bob marley and the marlboro man
