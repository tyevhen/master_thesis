do n't trust every study you hear in an article by john m grohol psyd at psychcentral , he takes issue with an article in the new yorker by jonah lerner that suggests the scientific method is dead grohol , taking the lead from scienceblogs writer pz meyers , asserts that science is not dead , and gives reasons that are well established in the scientific community for why sketchy research results are allowed to go public he lists seven , and i quote regression to the mean as the number of data points increases , we expect the average values to regress to the true mean and since often the initial work is done on the basis of promising early results , we expect more data to even out a fortuitously significant early outcome the file drawer effect results that are not significant are hard to publish , and end up stashed away in a cabinet however , as a result becomes established , contrary results become more interesting and publishable investigator bias it s difficult to maintain scientific dispassion we d all love to see our hypotheses validated , so we tend to consciously or unconsciously select results that favor our views commercial bias drug companies want to make money they can make money off a placebo if there is some statistical support for it there is certainly a bias towards exploiting statistical outliers for profit population variance success in a well defined subset of the population may lead to a bit of creep if the drug helps this group with well defined symptoms , maybe we should try it on this other group with marginal symptoms and it doesn t but those numbers will still be used in estimating its overall efficacy simple chance this is a hard one to get across to people , i ve found but if something is significant at the p level , that still means that in experiments with a completely useless drug will still exhibit a significant effect statistical fishing i hate this one , and i see it all the time the planned experiment revealed no significant results , so the data is pored over and any significant correlation is seized upon and published as if it was intended see previous explanation if the data set is complex enough , you ll always find a correlation somewhere , purely by chance conclusion do n't let shoddy research methods give science a bad name by the way , i'm saddened to learn that psychology studies are rife with potential error given the small , homogeneous samples n so , dear reader , be skeptical when you read about so called scientific findings , even ones i post here , and keep these points in mind
