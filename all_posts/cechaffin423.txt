devout i wake up to a house cold as a stone the old dog limps downstairs , i let him out he wanders in a forest of his own my wife nests in her bed , warm but alone her sleeping face warms me , what love s about i wake up to a house cold as a stone she loves me more than anyone i ve known her heart s heat is what keeps the true chill out he wanders in a forest of his own there is no sin for which these words atone my love , being deaf , can t hear them if i shout i wake up to a house cold as a stone love is a small , shy bird easily flown and can t be caged in words within , without he wanders in a forest of his own we re not just one , we re not each other s clone our separateness doth make our love devout i wake up to a house cold as a stone love wanders in a forest of his own this marks the end of my villanelle composition for november i ve already touched upon nature , death and god , so i thought one on love would be a suitable ending , though i think my darker villanelles were in general , better what have i learned from writing these villanelles ? first , that form is still relevant second , that the power of anaphora persists as strong as ever repetition of phrases adds power to poems third , this form isn t hard , although the choice of end rhymes is important as you only get two rhymes you don t want to end a line with industrial , for instance i can only hope the reader enjoyed these poems as much as i did writing them the artistic discipline they required each morning has been one stay against my ongoing depression while writing i think about the poem , not myself my wife encouraged me to no longer rate my mood , but i would put it at kilorats today yesterday i sent another ms off to another ms contest , this time the richard wilbur award i think i have mss floating in four contests now , but the odds that my one ms out of should be selected are rather astronomical but it is a discipline or sorts , even if it costs a pop i cried yesterday while sitting with kathleen i felt myself a complete failure between tears i mumbled so this is my choice to be a lousy poet or a crazy doctor so i felt so depression makes me feel but kathleen reminded me that i was an outstanding doctor , and i was and she doesn t think i m a lousy poet she thinks i m good when i m feeling better , i , too can have such positive thoughts but now i walk through a wasteland of self despite my twisted logic says if i feel this bad , i must be this bad when feelings rule , you re really up shit creek in depression feeling drives thought in normal mood , thought drives feeling in depression i think of myself sadly because i m sad in a normal mood i would feel sad only if i suffered some loss i m also terribly ambivalent about poetry , a love hate relationship i ve had for a long time , because i feel my poetry will never gain the recognition i had hoped , and therefore fear i am wasting my time , and i need to find a real job if only my back and mood were better but i go on writing as i say to my students and i haven t had one for a while , only write poetry if you cannot not write poetry that s how it s always been for me i have not decided on a form for december i m considering pantoums and ghazals tomorrow i should debut the new form of the month thine , ce
