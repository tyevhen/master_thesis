merry christmas to all of my readers ! disclaimer happy holidays too ! this week has been a good one it 's been really nice being on break and i got so much stuff done i ca n't believe it for one thing , i supposedly fixed my financial aid problem i was told when i filed my fafsa that i could n't get financial aid until i declared a major but i did n't want to declare a major my major is getting myself into pa program so this week , i declared a major i am now pursuing an aa with emphasis in biology ha ! that 's a step down from my phd anyway , i'm hoping that if i get proper funding , i can move down to a part time job hopefully as an emt and take more classes each semester that 'll speed up my process quite a bit if you remember from my last update , i was entering into a nocaffeine challenge the first week is complete , and i never even suffered from a headache ! i did suffer from mildly crippling exhaustion , though that may have been exacerbated by giving platelets on monday in fact , sometimes i wonder if giving platelets is just really bad for me it seems like every time i give platelets , i get exhausted but there are always extenuating circumstances like last time i worked till am and then was in to work at am the next day is n't that reason enough to be exhausted ? so for right now , i'm going to continue my donations next week i'm going to start reading chapters in my emt textbook getting ahead for the semester my reason is that i know how much reading there is because i tried taking the class last semester and my first month of the class will be difficult since i will be busy two evenings per week training for the columns program you know , the one where i work with a life term parolee recently released from prison i plan on keeping bullet points of things i 've learned from the chapters and from class so because i think it 's sort of fun you are welcome to peruse , skim , or skip feature and follow question what was the best christmas or other holiday gift i ever received ? well , my dad usually gets me a gift card for barnes and noble this year he got me a gift card totally the best posts missing person , by patrick modiano a klingon christmas carol , at the historic mounds theatre the sixth extinction , by elizabeth kolbert how to train your dragon , by cressida cowell lord of the rings a short comment on allegory the first christmas , by marcus j borg and john dominic crossan books completed books acquired film and theater bookish presents to others these were given to one of the residents at the nursing home i work at she said she liked history i thought it was a good selection gave these books to my boyfriend 's nephew he 's too young for them , but i figure his parents can read them to him they 're on the harry potter books now these went to my mom to my friend liz who is hopefully not reading this if you are , i also got you chocolates these go to my aunt this update is posted to feature and follow friday parajunkee and alison can read , stacking the shelves tynga 'sreviews , sunday salon , sunday post caffeinatedbookreviewer , mailboxmonday , it 's monday what are you reading bookdate
