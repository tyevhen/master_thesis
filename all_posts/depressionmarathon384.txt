life has been a bit rocky lately my mood has been unpredictable while i 've been functioning well at work , socializing a bit , and running , well , a little less , i 've also been tired , sleeping a lot , and had random attacks of utter hopelessness i 've struggled with some really low moments and low motivation over the past couple of weeks it 's been challenging i do n't think i ever mentioned it here , but about or weeks ago , since i had been doing so well for so long , i asked to have one of my anti depressants decreased my doctor agreed so we decreased the dose by one third it 's not that i was having any side effects , at least not that i know of , but i always want to be on the lowest dose possible of course , my grand hope is full remission and eventually no medication , hence this recent experiment i'm not so sure the rocky road i 've been experiencing is entirely due to the decreased anti depressant i 've had a lot of emotional stuff going on lately as well but of course it makes sense to go back up on my dose and attempt to stop this slide before it really gets rolling after consultation with my social worker and doctor , i resumed taking my previous inti depressant dose here 's the thing i feel like i failed i know it 's stupid taking a certain dose of a certain medication does not mean i failed if one of my patients with high blood pressure or diabetes made lifestyle changes in an effort to decrease their medication , and it did n't pan out , i would never , ever think they failed many chronic , biological illnesses respond to lifestyle changes , yet still require medication to control i know that i also know i , too , have a chronic , biological illness , but i still feel like i failed and to tell you the truth , failing makes me angry i'm so tired of being attached to this illness , and i do n't know how much more i can do to fight it i work hard to keep my life stable and drama free i eat well i get plenty of sleep i exercise i challenge myself and set goals in order to keep moving forward i work with people i enjoy at a very fulfilling job i stay sober and participate in my aa community i socialize with other healthy people what else is there ? should n't all of these good habits make a difference ? intellectually i know what i'm doing probably is making a difference i ca n't imagine the power and control this illness would wield if i did n't have a healthy lifestyle i'm certainly going to keep doing what i'm doing , and i know taking my medication is part of the whole equation i guess i need to stop worrying about how much or how many meds i take perhaps i need to remember to be grateful i have meds that work instead i 'll work on that
