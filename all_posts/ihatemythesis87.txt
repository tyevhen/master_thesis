i just realized that i have yet to follow through on the title of this blog i have written around my thesis but i have not yet written about it do n't worry , i will spare you the gory details and avoid yet again compromising my anonymity but it 's only fair i share a few reasons why i hate the thing that i have temporarily , i hope devoted my life to i am oh so tired and still have to study more , so you only get one tonight but more will follow sooner or later reason i hate my thesis i got to choose the topic naturally , so the research is actually pretty interesting or it was two odd years ago when i first laid eyes on the beast now my brain registers thesis in the same category as these lyrics , there 's a lady who 's sure all that glitters is gold that 's with a cringe , if you had to ask yes , my thesis is like led zeppelin it was so amazing the first million times i heard it and now , i can only sigh thesis progress that 's another cringe and a sigh i'm royally in big big trouble i do not know how i will produce magic between now and friday
