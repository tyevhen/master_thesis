the link below opens a recent study published in the journal of neurology , neurosurgery psychiatry it explains sbma kennedy s disease very well the report is not just focused on the motor neurons it goes into detail explaining other aspects of the condition and other potential opportunities for a treatment beyondmotor neurons expanding the clinical spectrum in kennedy s disease raquel manzano , gianni sorar , christopher grunseich , pietro fratta , emanuela zuccaro , maria pennuto , carlo rinaldi compared with other motor neuron diseases , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als , disease progression is relatively slow , with muscle strength declining by per year recent evidence has shown that the muscle atrophy in sbma is not solely secondary to the motor neuron degeneration but also consequence of a primary myopathic process in addition , sbma is frequently complicated by other signs and symptoms such as gynaecomastia , impotence , testicular atrophy and metabolic changes , suggesting a multisystem involvement in the disease these features frequently manifest early in the disease course and can contribute substantially to the morbidity in this review , we discuss the non motor neuron abnormalities underlining sbma symptomatology we propose that an improved understanding of these features not only could result in better management of the patients sbma , but also has the potential to shed new light into the disease pathogenesis , lead to the discovery of biomarkers for disease progression and open new treatment avenues motor neurons are particularly sensitive to alterations in the proteostasis network , likely due to their extreme polarisation and post mitotic nature on the other side , alterations of protein quality control in muscle , by tilting the balance towards increased protein degradation , are likely the underlying cause of the muscle atrophy observed in this disease i feel this information should be shared with your primary care doctors it might help explain other symptoms not normally associated with kennedy s disease
