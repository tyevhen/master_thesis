june is here and the sun is shining which helps to make everything look and feel so much brighter as i am still slightly traumatised by my encounter with the zip wire last week i am very pleased to note that june 's resolution is so much calmer adopt better habits boring ! i came up with this challenge when i realised how i 'd let my recycling slip , so this goal was a way to get back on track as i gave it some extra thought i came to the conclusion that recycling my rubbish was a pretty lame topic to cover and all my readers would be nodding off before i 'd managed to soak the label off an old baked bean tin so yes i am going to adopt better habits , my tins are stripped and ready for collection , my milk cartons are washed out and crushed and my cardboard is flat and bound for the paper truck how good am i ? but for my blog , i am going to recycle in a more holistic way intrigued ? when i run my personal development workshops i often refer to space clearing which in turn helps to clear the mind this is a great starting point for any new venture , idea or period of recovery a clean slate if you like clearing your clutter is one of the most effective ways to feel amazing , lighter , brighter and very often a wee bit richer so here are your easy steps to achieve inner peace take responsibility look around you , are there piles of magazines , old books , cd 's you no longer listen to or have uploaded to your ipod do you own fourteen glass vases but never buy flowers ? does your wardrobe contain 'thin' clothes and 'fat' clothes and 'not in a month of sunday am i going to wear again' clothes ? if you said yes go on admit it then clearing the clutter is for you it is incredibly empowering to steam in and have a good sort out i do this on a regular basis , normally when i feel my energy levels dip i take a look around and may notice that the cupboard under the stairs is full of the kids shoes , coats and other 'out of sight , out of mind' rubbish a quick tidy up and i feel my energy levels begin to rise i love this japanese proverb and have it stuck on my pin board 'the day you decide to do , it is your lucky day ' it works on so many levels but for the purpose of clearing clutter i can tell you i have found the odd fiver tucked away in old coats on more than one occasion ! take it slowly i do everything at a hundred miles an hour but when i clear my clutter i tend to savour the moment if you are looking around at a mountain of 'stuff' do n't panic , it may look overwhelming but it does n't have to be you 've taken responsibility so the hard bit 's over now is the action part of the plan take it one room at a time when you look around the room you have chosen break it down even further , take it one piece of furniture at a time clear a desk drawer or one shelf on the bookcase and then build up to the entire desk or a couple of other shelves tools to help the only tools you will need are a big mug of coffee and cardboard boxes label the boxes , donate , bin and sell donate this is your charity box , anything that is n't broken but no longer has any place in your home could make someone else very happy and become their most prized possession you did that , you made someone else happy , wow ! bin we all gather bits and bobs which have no value or reason i recently cleared my desk out and threw nineteen pens which had run out of ink god knows why i had put them back in my desk ?
