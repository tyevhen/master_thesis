i wish i had something more positive to write about today , but unfortunately i'm still in pain there has been no resolution to my back issues my left leg remains so weak i am unable to walk without increased pain and a significant limp i am using crutches for any distance beyond my kitchen to living room i am on pain medications , which as a sober person makes me quite nervous , but they are necessary for the pain i am experiencing i continue to have difficulty finding positions which are comfortable , and even if i find one , it only remains comfortable for a short time sleep occurs a couple of hours at a time , and i am generally exhausted pain , it turns out , is exhausting my life has not only been interrupted , it 's been entirely halted i ca n't work i ca n't run i can hardly get dressed movement is painful not moving is painful i'm confined to my home hours a day i need help with most of my household chores , but so far i 've resisted asking i hate asking for help , but i know i'm eventually going to have to relent one of my coworkers did mow my lawn a few days ago , which was a relief i was grateful he offered jet is bored and restless , as he also went from running miles per week to zero , but there 's not a thing i can do about it i feel unproductive and useless needless to say , my mood is getting worse and worse i'm trying hard to stay hopeful , but with each passing day i feel that hope slipping away i'm certainly worried this issue is going to lead to a depression relapse , but i have n't given up fighting yet i'm working with my employer to find something i can do to help out , even if just for an hour or two i'm beginning physical therapy today and i 've walked on the alter g gravity eliminating treadmill , at only of my body weight and for only minutes , twice in the last several days it was n't much , but at least i got to move i 've fought through a lot over the past couple of years i guess this is just one more battle i have to conquer i'm scared , anxious and incredulous , but i'm still fighting
