i started weight watchers last week i lost lb this week as i gave up on the diet for two days i am satisfied i would have been satisfied with no change in weight so loosing lb was a bonus i am still struggling to do anything the smallest of tasks just seem to be completely over whelming so i end up getting nothing done i do n't seem to be able to break things up into manageable tasks at the moment i am suppose to be going away this weekend but getting ready seems too difficult i worry that i am messing up my brain and turning into someone who is not me then again i do n't know who i am anyway i do know i was happy with life a little while ago before i started changing medications now i am awake a lot more but i am struggling to work and function i cannot hold a thought in my head ! o i want a holiday from antipsychotic medications but my psychiatrist says because i have had a severe psychotic breakdown in the past he cannot recomend it and i am likely to relapse if i stop taking them
