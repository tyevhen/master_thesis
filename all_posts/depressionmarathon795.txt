i apologize for not writing as frequently as i usually do things are still tough around here my brain is broken at least that 's how i like to think of it sometimes thinking like that makes this damn illness less personal it 's not me failing my brain is failing i suspect that type of thinking only makes sense to those of you who 've experienced depression right now my brain is failing all over the place ! things got so dark and deep yesterday , i called my doctor she suggested i increase one of my meds i'm never a fan of changing meds , especially if the change is to add something my little medication cocktail has been working so well for so long , i only like to mess with it if we 're decreasing or discontinuing something at this point , however , i do n't think i have much choice but to change it up it 's a small change we 're making , and i'm looking at it as temporary hopefully , it will help lift the darkness i think it 's the right decision at this time i 've not been able to motivate or change the current state on my own i'm frustrated and overwhelmed i'm tired i 've got no motivation to do anything being around people is painful , and i'm feeling empty and dead inside there 's no time like the present to try something different i know this will pass it has to it always has before it 's been a long time since i 've been in this place , and for that i am truly grateful i just need to hang on , and that 's what i'm trying to do it would help if i could cut myself some slack , rather than beat myself up for being tired , lazy and useless , but i ca n't seem to get the hang of that eventually , whether i practice serene acceptance or beat myself up , this ride will end hopefully , my med change will speed up the process in the meantime , i 'll just keep hanging on
