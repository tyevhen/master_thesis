on friday , i 'll be part of a massive effort , spearheaded by mandy roth and yasmine galenorn , for authors to speak out against bullying i 'll by interviewing my kids , who have both experienced bullying , for a first hand look at what it feels like to be the victim of such horrible attacks here is a list of participants , courtesy of mandy roth in other somber news , i was in a terrifying car accident saturday , in which a moron driving in front of me on a high traffic , high wind , freeway bridge high above a river , hit a bump and his unsecured king sized box springs went flying through the air and straight at my face yes , it smashed into my windshield at mph , and just the sight of it blocking out the sun as it shot toward me , and the instant thought that i was going to be decapitated or plunge into the river , was enough to scare the crap out of me not to mention the shattered pieces of glass all over my car i did n't realize until a couple of hours later that several of them were in my hair and clothes so i spent saturday afternoon and all morning today dealing with insurance and glass repair people and i have to take car to shop for body damage but nobody was hurt , thank goodness and i'm especially proud that i did not jump up and down on the moron 's head the state trooper said that the ticket carried a mandatory court appearance for the guy , so i can only hope the fine is huge but my kids were not in the car , and as i said , nobody was hurt , so i'm putting this one in the lucky it was n't worse category , although i'm not sure when i 'll be wanting to drive over that bridge again my wish for today is that you all drive safely , surrounded by cautious drivers who do not fling bed parts at your head hugs , alyssa ps shiloh walker will be my guest on friends' books wednesday this week
