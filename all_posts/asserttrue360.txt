in may , jack kerouac wrote his friend neal cassady to tell him about the road trip novel he 'd just finished in the letter , kerouac talked of how he had typed the entire manuscript between april and april , on a single foot roll of teletype paper , single spaced , just rolled it through typewriter and in fact no paragraphs rolled it out on floor and it looks like a road kerouac 's famous scroll manuscript for on the road six years later , an edited , vastly shortened version of the manuscript with the characters' real names changed to fictional ones was published by viking penguin in mutilated form , allen ginsburg once said in , to mark the book 's th anniversary , viking penguin published the original single paragraph scroll version of on the road , complete with creative spellings and containing the sex scenes that had earlier been deemed too controversial , with original character names intact and no attempt to correct anything other than the most obvious typos the original scroll is today owned by sports magnate jim irsay , who paid million for it in the scroll version is the edition i just finished reading , and it 's the only edition of on the road anyone should ever read , because the single long paragraph nature of the book and the use of real names for real people are crucial elements of the work , in my opinion like jack himself both in the story and in the writing of the manuscript , i got off to a bad start with the book , reading the first pages in one sitting , then making the mistake of letting it go cold for several days in a book with no plot that 's told completely experientially , that 's printed as a single page paragraph with no breaks , you have no structural reference points to hold onto , whether typographically or in the story line , which means that if you walk away from it , you forget where you were almost instantly in my case , i found myself starting again at page one after the first false attempt and i made damn sure to keep moving from that point on , stopping only to eat , bathe , attend to bodily needs , etc before resuming the trip i got through the book with difficulty kerouac 's language is suitably mellifluous and inventive , his reportage sincere and seemingly accurate but the nonstop parade of nonsensical events , leavened by the tragicomic personal life misadventures of the womanizing neal cassady , is ultimately tiresome happily , after pages or so , the travelers arrive at the burroughs ranch in algiers , louisiana , and the writing style pivots ever so slightly as kerouac launches into a loving , carefully crafted portrait of the enigmatic bill burroughs from there , it 's back to a meandering series of road trips to new york and san francisco always by way of denver , with various side trips thrown in the great depression had long since ended , of course this was , but you could n't tell it from the indigence of the characters jack 's monthly checks from the veterans' administration seldom went far , what with neal cassady 's constant need for booze , cigarettes , gasoline , weed , and bail money what they could n't afford to buy , they often stole in cassady 's case , that sometimes included cars at one point in the story , kerouac inexplicably comes into a sizable for those days sum of cash , it 's never explained that this was , in fact , the advance for kerouac 's first novel , the town and the city he uses it to move his mother from long island to denver the woman finds denver not to her liking and moves back to new york money gone , jack hits the road again the story accelerates and acquires an almost hunter thompson like feel in book three the book breakpoints are unceremoniously noted inline in the text , without indents or spacing when cassady and kerouac agree to deliver a two year old cadillac limousine from denver to chicago they put over , miles on the car in hours , breaking the speedometer cable after exceeding mph along the way , they suffer various mishaps and end up turning the car over to the owner in ramshackle condition miraculously , the owner never sends the police after them arguably the best storytelling comes in book four , when cassady and kerouac , having exhausted america 's highway system , head to mexico the writing is vivid , piquant , engaging , endearing unforgettable of course , there is never any hint of a plot , dramatic structure , etc , and that 's exactly the point of the book and of life the journey is itself the point it 's also why on the road could n't possibly find a major publisher as it did in if it were written today it does n't check the checkboxes of agents' and publishers' minimum requirements for a novel in fact , it quite deliberately gives the finger to all such requirements which is why on the road stands virtually alone among bestselling novels of the past years as being truly experimental yet also truly a quintessential piece of americana and american literature it would be fun to submit the book , in manuscript form as a single paragraph under a pseudonym , to agents and publishers , just to collect the rejection slips generated by the legions of interns and editorial assistants and self appointed arbiters of the literary status quo who would never dare take a chance on anything as proto gonzo as a plotless , one paragraph , , word road diary centered around an itinerant womanizer con man and his urbane college dropout buddy noo noo nooo , we sha n't have any of this today , kerouac if he were starting anew would have to put out his own print on demand and e book editions of his work and then go about the grim business of gaming the amazon rating system , maintaining a blog and facebook page and twitter account , and doing all the other must do activities of writers who want to rise above the background noise of what today passes for literature , all without a hope of ever getting a review in the new york times much less the kind of review on the road got from gilbert millstein in we should all be glad that kerouac and on the road came along when they did , at a time when a quiet , humdrum , thoroughly racist , excruciatingly conformist america needed the kind of wake up call kerouac provided , and the kind a new york city publishing establishment was still able to give those days are over , of course we 're on a different kind of road now
