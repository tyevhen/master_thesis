i hope everyone had a wonderful memorial day ! my weekend getaway went extremely well i think that all the preparing that i did really helped because my anxiety was n't an issue at all while i was away i was able to get up and eat meals and socialize just fine until surprisingly the long drive home i was thinking about how well i did and was feeling proud of myself when the thought entered my mind , what if i get home and the anxiety returns ? and would n't you know it , instant panic set in my arms were burning , my stomach churning i kept telling myself that i was ok and that everything would be fine , but i could n't get the symptoms to go away or calm myself down eventually i ended up taking a little clonazepam to take the edge off and that helped its so touch and go that it can be frustrating at times a scenario that will most of the time be really difficult will be absolutely fine and then another scenario where i am usually fine will all of a sudden be really difficult mornings are still an issue right now i still wake up with anxiety , not every day but sometimes , and so i have been taking the mornings easy i have been nervous about eating breakfasts since my stomach is all yucky from the anxiety so i have been munching on saltines the last few days for breakfast so that i am at least eating something i have been doing yoga every other day and the more i do it the more my body craves it it really helps to shake off any lingering anxiety in the morning and to feel good about the day to help me not get overwhelmed with everything on my plate , my mantra has been do what you can , when you can whenever i start to worry about something not getting done i say that to myself a couple of times it helps me to remember that i am doing the best i can and if i do n't get to something today thats ok , i can get to it later i 've been thinking about how much my anxiety revolves around the negative thoughts in my head and it makes me wonder how long i have been doing that for and if it was something i picked up from those around me growing up or if its just how i am it makes me think about when raising my kids how i want them to be happy , confident , and positive in their thinking so they do n't have these same problems how do i teach that and not let them feed off my poor example ? i know i can praise them a lot to raise their self esteem , but how do i teach them to not think badly of themselves or to care what others think ? i found a really great article on the subject here the power of our thoughts has been recognized for centuries for better or worse , out thoughts determine who we become and what we manifest during our earthly stay helping our children to understand this truth adds awareness and intention to the power they already possess as thinking beings how can you help your child grow up knowing the power of thought , and especially the power of positive thought ? some ideas follow keep your thoughts and words gentle , be deliberately positive speak kindly of all family members and friends approach your work with enthusiasm curtail complaining in favor of problem solving speak the language of hope and affirmation say i will and i can often !
