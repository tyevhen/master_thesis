question in your book depression is a choice you say that your husband is never depressed did you feel guilty about your husband ever ? what i mean is when you were so depressed all those years for myself i keep thinking that this is not the person my husband signed on to marry someone who is constantly miserable and unhappy i love him so much that i would rather see him with someone else who does not have this trouble someone who is not afraid of so much , afraid to have kids i feel like such a burden also i am deeply embarrassed that i ca n't control my mind enough to be happy it 's so effing embarrassing answer one of the first permissions i gave myself after i started to get a better handle on my depression was that i don t have to be happy it s not a requirement in order to move ahead with my day you d be surprised how much guilt this lifted from my overburdened soul you can t just will yourself happy it doesn t work that way happiness is a byproduct of the relationship between on purpose thinking and on purpose behavior when those moments of unhappiness come to me , i recognize them and accept them but i no longer self focus on them i no longer further power up the fear factory of stress chemicals by the immediate reactive thought oh , no not again ! i quickly move on to something more pro active and productive what i found was that no matter how unhappy i get , i can always be cheerful just because i get a neurological hit of depression , that doesn t mean i am therefore compelled to do all the depressive behaviors i used to do in addition to the yucky feelings still blindsided me now and then you do n't have to be happy , you just have to be cheerful and move forward courageously with your day you just have to avoid and ignore whatever unhappiness has fallen to your lot unhappiness , a feeling , is a product of the subcortex cheerfulness , a principle of attitude , is a product of the neocortex we have two different chemical factories and we can choose which one we wish to power up by manning one production line or the other , according to the thoughts we choose to think true joy , says seneca , is a serene and sober motion and they are miserably out that take laughing for rejoicing the seat of it is within and there is no cheerfulness like the resolutions of a brave mind a b curtiss
