i was so excited when i got contacted to review blurt foundation 's buddy box for those of you who do n't know , blurt foundation is an organisation that is helping people through their mental illnesses , namely depression not too long along ago , they set up a monthly box which they send to their subscribers filled with a range of different things to help you through that month and continue to help you battle your struggles i like to think that it 's a hug in a box although it wo n't solve your mental illness , it certainly does help to have things that can help you through it i'm really happy that such a service exists because i forever see boxes for beauty , but i have never seen one dedicated to those who are affected by depression i ca n't wait to try all of the items included and see how they help me along my way this month 's box included a notebook and pencil , some tea , some seaweed for the bath , some postcards and an origami set i will certainly be using the notebook and pencil as i am always writing , as for the seaweed i find having baths as a great way to reduce anxiety and so i will try it next time round tea is also another calming method i use i always find it it to be a cuddle in a cup however , i 've never tried this flavour so it will be all new to me and finally , i used to do origami when i was younger , but i gave it up i never seem to do many things that are creative these days so perhaps this is a sign to get back into something like this it 's also a great way to take a step back from the day and have some time not think about the world around you i am really impressed with this box and i think it will help many people if you 're interested in becoming a subscriber or wish to get a box for someone you love , then click , here thanks again , amy xx
