dear depression , you have been in my life for far longer than i ever realised , skulking about in the shadows like a malevolent troll you slowly depleted my confidence and wiped the smile from my face , and yet all the time i thought i was to blame i believed that i was too weak , too boring , and too insignificant and i almost let you win you made me feel so lonely that i believed there was an invisible wall around me i began to feel discouraged by everything the future had to offer you got to me in so many ways emotionally , physically and spiritually i could no longer find comfort in the things that once helped boost my wellbeing you cut me off from the beautiful world and laughed as i floundered in the choking fear that tried to drown me maybe it was you that contributed to the physical pains i endure every day my muscles scream with every movement i ache all the time , i can t sleep and i embark on moments on self destruction with my diet , but i think you feed on these debilitating feelings you thrive on negative energy and found an inviting home in my suffering you distorted how i saw the world , stripping away the abundance of love and friendship that surrounded me and made me believe that i was alone i saw myself as a burden to my friends i supposed that i had become the negative force in their lives and trusted that they would be better off without me i understand that you may always be a part of my life but i refuse to let you win you can take away my light and make me feel inadequate you can terrorise me into considering that i have no control , but you are wrong yes , i will have bad days , but that s okay because i now realise that every morning , when i wake , i have a choice and i choose to defeat you i vow to live my life with passion , creativity and love we aren t on this incredible planet for long and you have taken far too much from me already tomorrow , i will rise like the sun and let my light shine because you will have retreated into the shadows thank you for the lesson you have given me but i m now fully qualified to take back control regards shelley x
