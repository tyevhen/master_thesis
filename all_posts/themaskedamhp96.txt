the sun s full page headline today th october states baldly , killed by mental patients the number , is in red letters inches high in tiny letters to the side of this headline is the admission that this figure was the total over a decade it s hard to know where to start in a dissection of this report that huge red number is clearly intended to alarm one has to conclude that the sun wishes to suggest that its readers are all at risk of being murdered in their beds by homicidal maniacs the sun s use of the term mental patients is not only deliberate use of a term with pejorative implications , but also implies that there are two sorts of people normal people sun readers perhaps ? and mental people , people who are unpredictable and potentially dangerous having emblazoned its front page with this frightening statement , the sun s full story is buried on pages and it begins a sun investigation today reveals disturbing failings in britain s mental health system that have allowed high risk patients to kill , in a decade the article is fringed by brief accounts of people who have been murdered by mental patients over the last few years so where did the sun obtain these figures ? it mentions a manchester university study this can only be the annual report the national confidential inquiry into suicideand homicide by people with mental illness , published by the university of manchester in july the sun s probe their word , must have taken all of seconds before finding this study , which was published months previously in july community care published a thoughtful article back on thjuly , headlining their article with a quote from the report saying the number of homicides committed by mental health patients has fallen to its lowest level for a decade the writer of this report , julian hendy , goes on to express skepticism of some of the figures the sun reports that people a year on average were killed by mental patients this would appear to have been lifted from community care s article the sun goes on to lay the blame for these figures on the slashing of budgets for mental health care they quote marjorie wallace of sane as saying that homicide figures may not have increased in decades but significantly they have not declined either so what does the university of manchester report actually say ? right at the beginning of the report , it is stated homicide by mental health patients has fallen substantially since a peak in , and the figures for the most recent confirmed years , , are the lowest since we began data collection in although the report acknowledges that some of its statistics may be incomplete , it does say it is likely that this is a true fall in patient homicide already , this seems to be factually at odds with the sun s report while i do not wish to minimise the potential effects of recent cutbacks to spending on mental health , in this case , recent changes in mental health legislation and delivery are given as a possible explanation for this reduction , citing the use of cto s as a potential factor another failing of the sun s probe is to place these figures in any sort of context the office of national statistics provides illuminating statistics for overall numbers of homicides it gives statistics going back to for homicides initially recorded by the police the long term graph shows a gradual increase in homicides from in to a peak of in since then , there has been a steep fall to around half of that peak taking the ons statistics , it can be seen that during the year period from on which the sun bases its figures , there were a total of homicides this compares with the figure of homicides committed by mental health patients quoted by the sun and julian hendy in other words , a little over of homicides were committed by people who were known patients of mental health services to put it another way , of murders were committed by people who weren t mental patients but i suppose the headline you re times more likely to be killed by a normal person than someone with mental health problems doesn t have quite the same ring to it
