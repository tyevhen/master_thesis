lately i have been a bit of a slacker when it comes to behaviors i know in the long run will help me feel better but i am not in the mood to do them it can feel like a lot of work sometimes to start a new behavior , especially if you feel under the weather like i do right now so i thought i would do a little research on motivating myself to get off the couch which will be even tougher now that new fall series are starting ! and do my yoga , prepare for a healthy meal , or even simply taking my medication i have simply gotten lazy here is a really cool article i found by skye thomas over at www icbs com achieving the really big goals and dreams always involves breaking it down into do able little steps assuming that you 've picked a goal or dream that you really love working at , then most of the steps are a delight to take no matter how much you love your dream and no matter how much you love your work , there are going to be tasks along the way that you really do n't want to do those pieces of work that we hate doing can be the very ones that sabotage our success how do you stay motivated during those parts of the journey ? reward yourself let 's say that i want to lose twenty pounds that 's not too much , but it 's still going to involve more days of self discipline that i feel like doing so , i reward myself with a little treat every time i drop five pounds i get to have one of my favorite fattening meals at the end of each five pound loss then i go back to my diet at the end , i get to go on a shopping spree to buy new clothes come up with a reward that you can use to motivate yourself do it for love of someone else my teenage son proposed a deal that works for both of us i do n't smoke cigarettes and he does n't experiment with drugs every time one of us is about to give in to temptation , our love for each other stops us i ca n't light up knowing that he might start doing drugs because i broke our deal he hates the idea of me dying of cancer , so he never touches any kinds of drugs offered to him by his peers the love of someone else can motivate you to do what you otherwise might not be able to do for yourself trade work with someone else i 've watched my kids perfect this style of motivation my son will offer to scrub out the showers if my daughter will do the dishes for him hiring someone to do the work you do n't want to do is actually a form of trade barter or pay someone else to do it for you , so that you can continue moving forward with your dreams truly consider quitting i'm not telling you to quit , but to really think about it if you 've got a goal or dream that means a lot to you and you 've already invested a large part of yourself into making it happen , then what would quitting feel like ? is avoiding the difficult or distasteful task worth giving up on your goals and dreams ? the love of your long term goal can motivate you not to quit share the misery this reminds me of friends in college getting together to study for an upcoming test having friends along can make the experience more festive then it would have been if you were doing it alone is there a way to team up with a friend so that the work is easier or at least more enjoyable ? just get it over with one of my all time favorite quotes about getting past your inner blocks was written by stuart wilde in his book the quickening , cut the shit and do the thing yeah it 's a bit rough , but we all know those stoic tough people who simply roll up their sleeves and dive in know matter how much they may hate the task before them take on a soldier 's mindset and just get to work doing the ugly parts so you can move on to the more rewarding parts of making your dreams a reality get training or education quite often , we do n't like doing something because deep down we do n't think we know how or that we are talented enough so , get the education , do the research , learn the necessary skills , or whatever else it is that you need to do to get ready for taking that next step once you 've properly trained yourself , then you might even be enthusiastic about taking that next step take a running start at it think of riding your bike uphill it does n't take kids very long to figure out that the best way to get that bicycle to the top of the steep hill is to build up a lot of speed before you even get to the base of the hill you then let that momentum help to propel you most of the way up heck , with enough of a running start you can sometimes make it all the way up without any major struggles if there is a way to pace yourself and reschedule the not so fun parts of accomplishing your goals until after you 've completed a bunch of the cool parts , then do so the highs of your mini successes will help inspire you to push past the parts that you are avoiding figure out a different way to do it this is the supreme way to avoid doing the task all together be creative , be smart , think outside the box is there any way to make your dream come true without having to actually do the specific duty that you 're wanting to avoid ? sometimes you can find another way other times , just knowing that there is definitely no other path to your dreams other than the one before you is enough to motivate you to just buck up and get through it what 's most important is not how you keep yourself motivated but that you keep the long term benefits of your goals in mind if you focus too much on avoiding the uncomfortable parts of accomplishing your goals , then you wo n't accomplish much find a way to keep going and remember that all things come with a price pay the price so you can get on with enjoying the dream i want to setup a reward program for myself because i think that will motivate me the most i am a material girl i 'll admit it ! any other good ideas to help you stay motivated to make the necessary life changes to reduce stress and anxiety in our lives ?
