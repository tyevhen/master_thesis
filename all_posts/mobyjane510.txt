dear a b curtiss my name is and i work for an independent living center called disability action center i watched a video called what the bleep are we doing which started me working on my mental health issues i have been telling people for about years the same thing i hated being a victim of the disability and decided to do something about it i have put depression , anger and pressure as a choice and now have chosen not to have these worthless feelings attached to me i have discussed this with people and have been getting a mixed bag of comments back i know that i have turned this around and know others can also if they really wish to do many people have resistance thinking which i feel stops one from moving ahead the thing about the choice idea is that a person has to take responsibility for their feelings and how they deal with things you can no longer blame the chemical process or anyone else for how you feel i am so glad to see that others believe like i do v e dear v e you are absolutely right on if you have any questions i will be happy to answer them a b curtiss
