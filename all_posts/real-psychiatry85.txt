cannabis use is highly politicized in the us at this time largely due to legalization rhetoric that has spilled over into scientific research on the topic despite the broad movement to legalize cannabis across the us , only a minority of the population are regular cannabis users more widespread use will undoubtedly lead to increased problems associated with wider exposure , especially wider exposure in populations with vulnerabilities to the toxic effects of cannabis the toxic effects of interest include addiction and psychosis it is common in clinical practice to encounter daily cannabis smokers who stopped using the substance after several years because they started to get panic attacks , paranoia , or both the people i see have all moved on to something else , but there are also a substantial number of chronic smokers who are addicted that number is about of users , and that is comparable to the amount of people who have problems from drinking alcohol inpatient psychiatrists commonly see people with florid psychotic episodes from smoking significant quantities of cannabis they also see repeat admissions from people who are either detoxified or treated for these psychotic episodes , are discharged and smoke more cannabis to the point of a repeat psychotic episode the longstanding controversy among people who are not doing the work and just speculating is whether any good observational studies can be done to show that cannabis does cause psychosis or if this is an artifact of observational methodology in other words , could a reverse causality bias exist that makes people who are prone to schizophrenia or psychotic episodes more likely to smoke cannabis in my opinion , there have been excellent observational studies showing the association between cannabis use and psychosis , but as long as that is the technology these studies will always contain the old association is not causation qualifier a recent paper in molecular psychiatry may have just illustrated the causation that psychiatrists have been experiencing firsthand for decades the authors use a novel genetic appraoch to look at the issue of causation the main assumption of this study is that using specific genotypes as the independent variable rather than observed individuals gets rid of the confounding demographic and environmental variables that could be casual they point out that any actual clinical trial looking at the issue of whether cannabis causes psychosis would be unethical , but that a model that looks at whether causation can be established by looking at single nucleotide polymorphisms snps from a genome wide association study gwas looking at the any cannabis use phenotype they looked at the top snps from that data that were used to calculate gene exposure snp cannabis estimates snp risk of schizophrenia exposure estimates were calculated from available data from the psychiatric genomics consortium instrumental variable estimates were made by dividing the risk of schizophrenia risk of any cannabis use the instrument variable analyses were pooled across snps and analyzed with fixed effect meta analysis the authors provide a detailed discussion and rationale for their statistical calculation in the full text of the article and supplementary material at this point i am going to post their main graphics click on any graphic to enlarge it the first graphic looks at prospective observational studies the authors were interested in determining whether their genetically based analysis was in the same direction of this meta analysis ever use cannabis use was associated with a increase in schizophrenia or psychosis figure meta analysis of prospective observational studies reporting an association between use of cannabis and risk of schizophrenia or related disorders meta analysis uses a random effects model studies are sorted by type of outcome schizophrenia only vs schizophrenia and related outcomes odds ratios ors

users for schizophrenia psychosis risk the authors did a sensitivity analysis of this same data by removing each snp from the analysis to calculate a summary causal effect of across all snps or when restricted to functional snps figure is included here to illustrate the authors' sensitivity analysis showing a summary casual effect of about red line all things considered this may be a compelling story for causation i qualify that of course in a couple of domains first there are a lot of statistical models and calculations operating here in my experience mapping complex statistical estimates onto the most complex object in the universe has not worked out very well my first hand experience was statistical modeling of quantitative eeg and claims that is was predictive of psychiatric diagnosis those compelling calculations published in science did not pan out at all in the long run it will be interesting to see if the authors applications are more widely applied to other snps to determine disease causation from other risk factors the second potential problem is a slight variation on that theme and that is the overall imprecision of meta analysis the known approximate prediction concordance rates of meta analyses for clinical trials suggests that it may not be good predictor of a reproducible result the authors themselves suggest that the potential limitations of their study start with the fact that none of the chosen snps met conventional genome wide significance thresholds the specific dose effect of cannabis could not be investigated in the study the age at exposure is may be a developmental variable of interest and that was unknown the mendelian randomization techniques may have not been powerful enough to detect pleiotropic one gene affecting more than one trait effects , but they discuss how an alternate analysis applies in this situation the other question i had was about epigenetic effects on this model the authors were certainly aware of smoking as a confounding variable the known epigenetic effects of nicotine on brain chromatin would seem to cloud snps as pure genetic risk factors but this is nonetheless one of the more interesting models and concepts i have seen in a while they conclude that their study is the closest approximation to a randomized trial on the effect of ever use of cannabis and risk of schizophrenia when such a clinical trial is unethical that is an interesting take on their method and causation hopefully it will open up the way for other studies of causation using these techniques if that is the case , it is a good idea to study this paper and the supplementary material pages and have a good idea about its difference from observational association studies the supplementary material is also very useful
