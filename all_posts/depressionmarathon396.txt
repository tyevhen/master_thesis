just a brief post this evening , as i am wiped out from a busy last days i am back in the swing of things the knock down i experienced at the end of last week only kept me down for a couple of days by late friday evening i was feeling lighter , and i was back on course by saturday in fact , i ran miles saturday morning in absolutely perfect , beautiful weather that certainly helped begin the weekend on the right foot i stayed busy with errands and chores the rest of saturday , as i had to work sunday my mood was good , and i had the energy to get done what needed to be done after working hours sunday , i took an hour to put my feet up and enjoy jet 's comedic antics , and then i ran miles those were very tough miles my legs were tired ! but i persevered and then got to bed early before another hour work day today my kettlebell and suspension training class tonight was tougher than usual i was fatigued , but i did what i could now i 've got my feet are up i'm watching my favorite team , the minnesota twins , and enjoying a cup of decaf , as i gather my thoughts and prepare myself for tomorrow 's schedule i 've got miles to run before heading off to work mid morning hopefully i 'll have enough energy after work to attend my evening aa meeting i think i'm due but i 'll worry about that tomorrow i'm doing well thank you for your kind words of encouragement i'm grateful to be feeling better
