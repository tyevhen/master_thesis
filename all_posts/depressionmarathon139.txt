this post has no title , as i truly have little to say my brain has been preoccupied this week i'm still ruminating about my oral surgery consult from last week ruminating is no good it 's a total waste of energy perhaps that 's why i'm feeling a little more tired this week , too it 's one thing to know ruminating is a total negative drain it 's another thing , apparently , to actually stop it i'm worrying about the huge financial drain of the upcoming surgeries i'm worried about the huge amount of time before my mouth will be normal again actually , there 's no guarantee my mouth will ever be normal again that 's really stressing me out ! it 's odd i'm not even scared about the pain , and there will be pain i'm anxious about all the other crap , none of which i have control over i 've got to reign it in despite my worried brain churning in the background , i'm doing okay otherwise work has been busy , but i'm handling it working more hours would actually help quell some of the financial fear , but my mood suffered when i tried that a couple of months ago , so i'm resisting the urge to do so i'm exercising as much as my energy will allow i'm starting to get some of my running shape back and dropping some weight , which is exciting that certainly helps my mood i 'll be traveling to grandma 's marathon next week it 's the th anniversary of my hometown race , so it will be tough to be an observer , but i'm looking forward to the excitement and energy nonetheless i'm also looking forward to spending time with some close friends , my parents , and hopefully my brother and his family while up in duluth it will be great to focus on those valuable relationships rather than on my lack of race participation i 'll race again , but future moments with friends and family are never guaranteed i'm not going to waste them finally i'm really excited to spend some time by the big lake i love lake superior it is my happy place calm serenity washes over me whenever i'm fortunate enough to stand on it 's shore i 've been to several wonderful , beautiful places around this world , but lake superior remains my favorite and that 's all i 've got carry on , my friends
