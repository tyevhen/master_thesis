one of my fellow bloggers just posted this video , and it 's one that has been and should continue to be shared within the autism community i think that for those on the outside looking in on the autism community , those who do n't understand how emotional it is to be on this journey , or who have n't taken the time to really think about it , this brings it home in a very real way i have to be honest and say that even though this video has been all over twitter you tube for many months now , i have never watched it katy perry and a little girl with autism sing firework ok well , i watched it tonight and the tears are still streaming down my face this is what we are striving for for our children , all of us we want them to feel like regular kids , to feel like they are good at something , like they have value for nathan , we just want him to talk to us every time i hear a story of a nonverbal child becoming verbal it gives me just one more sliver of hope makes me want to spend extra time working with him , giving him everything i have every autism parent goes through periods of hopelessness it 's natural with the roller coaster we are on here is one more thing to cling to also , really listen to the lyrics i feel like this song now belongs to autism , if that makes any sense i am sure that 's not how it was originally intended , but it most certainly fits , like a glove please watch , it 's worth the minutes i promise
