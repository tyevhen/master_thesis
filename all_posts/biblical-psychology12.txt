shalom is one of the most frequently used words in the hebrew bible to most of us , shalom means peace and in both ancient and modern hebrew language , shalom is spoken as a greeting it is also cited as a state of peace between parties biblically such as in joshua , sam the concept of shalom , however , encompasses much more than these applications the biblical application of the term extends to concepts of safety , wellness welfare , blessing and perhaps an all encompassing application of shalom is wholeness or completeness let s look at how it all fits together starting at the end , shalom is cited often at the end of the journey of life for those who follow godly paths will rest in peace shalom when they die is god spoke to abraham and said as for you , you will die in peace and be buried at a ripe old age gen , and to zedekiah , king of judah you will die peacefully as people made a funeral fire in honour of your fathers , the former kings who preceded you , so they will make a fire in your honour and lament , alas , o master ! i myself make this promise , declares the lord ' jer the use of shalom in this context implies that shalom is a goal to be reached , the ultimate fulfilled promise in the psalms , shalom is often equated with blessing the lord gives his people strength the lord blesses them with peace ps jerusalem , may there be peace within your walls and prosperity in your palaces for the sake of my family and friends , i will say , may you have peace ps peace is something we need and continuously seek this primary human need for safety and peace is portrayed vividly in the struggle of jacob early in his journey jacob barters with god for shalom and if i return safely state of shalom to my father 's home , then the lord will certainly be my god gen the scriptures teach that peace originates from god i will give you peace in the land , and you will be able to sleep with no cause for fear lev the lord gives his people strength the lord blesses them with peace ps indeed , after his encounter with the angel of the lord , gideon builds an altar and calls it the lord is peace we can t attain shalom apart from god granting it false peace is no peace historically we see that god establishes a covenant of peace with those who act in accordance with his purposes shalom is conditional on an expected action for instance , to phinehas , son of eleazar and grandson of aaron the priest who had turned god s anger away from the israelites , god promised now tell him that i am making my special covenant of peace with him num and of the covenant with the levites the purpose of my covenant with the levites was to bring life and peace , and that is what i gave them this required reverence from them , and they greatly revered me and stood in awe of my name mal but the meek will inherit the land and enjoy great peace ps the words of jesus echoing the promise blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth mat consider the blameless , observe the upright there is a future for the man of peace ps the covenant of peace between god and his people israel is spoken of in isaiah though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed , yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken nor my covenant of peace be removed , says the lord , who has compassion on you is i will teach all your children , and they will enjoy great peace v you will live in joy and peace the mountains and hills will burst into song , and the trees of the field will clap their hands ! bringing words of praise to their lips may they have abundant peace , both near and far , says the lord , who heals them is in the scriptures , peace and righteousness are intertwined unfailing love and truth have met together righteousness and peace have kissed ! ps and this righteousness will bring peace yes , it will bring quietness and confidence forever is similarly , truth is believed to be leading to a restoration of peace but this is what you must do tell the truth to each other render verdicts in your courts that are just and that lead to peace so love truth and peace zec shalom does not signal simply a state of being but an activity , a movement towards a goal or a state the hebrew root of the word is sh l m also carries the meaning of payment or a restored state the scriptures speak of a new covenant of shalom made by god through the messiah the government will rest on his shoulders and he will be called wonderful counsellor , mighty god , everlasting father , prince of peace his government and its peace will never end he will rule with fairness and justice from the throne of his ancestor david for all eternity the passionate commitment of the lord of heaven 's armies will make this happen ! is b but he was pierced for our rebellion , crushed for our sins he was beaten so we could be whole derived from shalom he was whipped so we could be healed is the writers of the new testament understood shalom in this context of restoration and establishing restitution through action and payment the apostle paul wrote of the work of the messiah on the cross and through him god reconciled everything to himself he made peace with everything in heaven and on earth by means of christ 's blood on the cross col shalom extends to peace between jew and gentile for he is our peace , who hath made both one , and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us eph shalom is core to relationship conditional on a price , established by god himself notes see also ki the scriptures distinguish between a true peace of god is to be distinguished and a false peace let s regard a few instances where false peace is described and warned against those who hear the warnings of this curse should not congratulate themselves , thinking , 'i am safe even though i am following the desires of my own stubborn heart ' this would lead to utter ruin ! the word used for safe here is derived from shalom , deut in the book of ezekiel , god speaks of false prophets who declare a false peace this will happen because these evil prophets deceive my people by saying , 'all is peaceful' when there is no peace at all ! it 's as if the people have built a flimsy wall , and these prophets are trying to reinforce it by covering it with whitewash ! ezek and v they were lying prophets who claimed peace would come to jerusalem when there was no peace i , the sovereign lord , have spoken ! ' and in micah this is what the lord says you false prophets are leading my people astray ! you promise peace for those who give you food , but you declare war on those who refuse to feed you
