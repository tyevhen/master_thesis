i do n't understand how some people can think that playing in the mud is somehow less worthy of a child 's time than learning to read or do arithmetic the whole point of life is to live well , fully , and with joy playing in a mud puddle , with the cool , smooth texture of wet earth squishing between your toes , the feel of mud as it dries on your skin , then cracks of and falls in dusty flakes to the ground the things you can make with it , and how good it feels in your hands the act of playing in mud is every bit as beautiful , in it 's own way , as taking joy in a beautifully constructed story , or the flowing lines of a poem people need to get past seeing the world in terms of things that are useful and things that are not , and start seeing it as the collection of things , events , places , people , and pursuits that make life wonderful ! i came across a comment someone had made about unschooling not possibly working , because of how you could never learn anything worthy from just playing in mud as if ! , and i just had to write down my own feelings on the topic ! peace , idzie you might also like blame unschooling ! learning by doing education made real unschooling for adults learning advice from a learning life linkwithin
