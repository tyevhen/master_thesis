hachette and amazon are locked in a pricing dispute that 's gone on for some time now it may eventually be resolved , although frankly , it could well go unresolved , too hachette does n't have to cave in to amazon 's demands hachette may well hold its hard line position forever and suffer the consequences in terms of poor placecment on amazon 's sites , shipping delays by amazon on hachette books , and so forth but many people believe the dispute will eventually be resolved is there a way for investors to come out ahead ? bear in mind , none of what follows constitutes investing advice i mention it as a hypothetical scenario here 's how some investors would play this situation we know that if the dispute is suddenly resolved , there 's a good chance amazon shares will go up in value but there 's also a chance hachette will pull the plug on amazon and announce a deal with another retailer , in which case amazon shares would likely plummet a resolution to the dispute could send amzn shares sharply higher , or sharply lower this is a classic example of a situation in which an options trader would hope to make money on a straddle a straddle is where you buy a call option and a put option one is a bullish bet the other a bearish bet , simultaneously , at the same strike price let 's say you think the dispute will be resolved in the next days you might decide to buy an october amzn call option for full contract price , shares , at the strike an october put is total cost these prices are based on the aug closing prices if the hachette dispute is resolved and the dispute resolution moves amzn share price by which is not unreasonable it 's less than of amazon 's current share price , one option will move into the money and the other will move out of the money currently , a into the money move on the call makes it worth while a out move makes its worth on the put , a move makes it worth either if the stock goes down or if the stock moves up in one case you end up with a total of and in the other case you end up with your initial investment was if you think the dispute wo n't resolve in september and there 's certainly no indication that it will , you could choose to buy january options the prices of the options will be higher but the straddle would still work , in theory the problem with all options contracts , though , is that they suffer substantial price decay over time for january contracts , figure roughly ten to twelve cents a share per day , per option bottom line , days' worth of waiting could cost you in decay on one call and one put so there 's a substantial penalty for having to wait and it looks like this dispute could go on for some time in fact , it could go on forever , since the parties are not obligated to reach an agreement also , bear in mind there 's no guarantee amzn stock price will move share when the hachette dispute is resolved if indeed it ever is resolved it could move a lot less , or not at all so use caution this is far from a risk free strategy disclaimer consult your investment advisor i am not one before doing any trades
