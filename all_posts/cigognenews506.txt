i cannot trust it when people say they got a lot out of therapy , unless of course , they are feeling i can trust their right brain it is to be trusted , like when they tell me their dreams and i know that the feelings inside doesn t lie that feeling comes from the right brain that is why i always go for the feeling inside the dream it tells us where the patient is the story the feeling tells is just that a story , a concoction derived from the feeling it is a concoction that makes rational the feeling and gives it some kind of sense but the story is only important to help us get to the feeling the feeling gave birth to the story so let us not waste time on it analyzing the story changes nothing because that same feeling will make up another one , and another until the feeling is felt and integrated no different from the obsession driven by a feeling i don t feel safe , i ll be safe if i check the locks twenty times a day let us not focus on check the locks let s focus on feeling unsafe and why that forms the emotional leitmotiv so some say we in our therapy need to do follow up studies i agree , but they want self reports from the patient re their progress , and i say it is rarely to be trusted but the machines that measure feelings and pain , the blood and urine studies do not lie and reflect for us the truth inside yes , it is also important for what the patient says but it must be accompanied by physiologic measurements , blood pressure , cortisol levels , heart rate , etc so why the skepticism ? because the feeling of happiness and progress in therapy is most often left brain and that can be very deceptive that is why using that brain to get to the past is an oxymoron it cannot be done talking about the pass won t get us to feeling i repeat , the ability to retrieve old memories is right brain it handles feelings present and past we need that road to go back , otherwise we are discussing the past but without feeling and experiencing it we are on the left road and it is not the right one , if you follow me intellect and cognitive memory won t get us there the problem is today in psychologic science that they won t followup studies using the very brain that is leading us astray and we really think that if we discuss our past that is fine it is not ! it is a head trip and we have had enough of that
