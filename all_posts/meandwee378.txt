hi friends ! ! i'm sorry we 've been missing we went on vacation with chris' parents last week to aruba ! paige and the rest of us loved it ! she did great on the plane rides only crying before her naps she really enjoyed the sand and the sights and of course the lazy river pool she could have floated all day long in there ! she did n't get seasick on our snorkeling sail one afternoon , rather , she enjoyed seeing the seagulls and relaxing on the lounge pads she behaved nicely at all the restaurants at dinner and was just a sweetie to all the strangers who talked to her i was a proud mama ! i'm bummed to be back in the cold winter chill , but am so thankful and happy to have such wonderful memories of paige 's very first big trip away ! i 'll be back in this space regularly this week and i hope you all are well i 'll share some photos below to help keep you warm too ! save
