pharmalot has a very interesting post regarding how lilly disseminates cash to various organizations the largest recent recipient was massachusetts general hospital , which by sheer coincidence ? , is where mauricio tohen , the lead scientist on the zyprexa team happens to hang his hat see update below ! in the first quarter of this year , lilly doled out over a half million dollars to the national alliance for the mentally ill this should come as no surprise , given that a few years ago , the head of nami was a lilly executive on loan from lilly so it comes as no surprise that nami often finds itself issuing talking points that coincide nicely with lilly 's goals , such as lobbying against restricting zyprexa usage much more over at pharmalot and the wall street journal registration required update i made an error i thought that dr tohen held an academic appointment at mass general i was mistaken he holds no such appointment i sincerely apologize for the mistake mea culpa rather than delete the offending text and leave the impression i am trying to cover my mistake , i will leave it above so that my error can be recognized publicly
