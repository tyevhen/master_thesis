david is just now recovering from e coli it was a two week bout of high tmeperatures to hot sweats , cold chills , no appetite , bed rest each day i wondered if we would have to admit him to the hospital but he did n't want to go i pushed liquids and mineral and green drinks he was on antibiotics for over a week when the doctors office called and told him the medication he was on did not work for e coli they put him on a new round of antibiotics but by that time he had white spots on his tongue yeast he lost pounds , but is now among the living again my friend , who owns a health food store , said that the mixture of wormwood , cloves and black walnut can help get rid of e coli this was interesting to me because this was the combination i took when i had parasites in my blood and body at the same time , i had liver cancer i had been to a health food store where i had microscopy done to check my blood on the enlarged screen , i saw a lot of little creatures swimming around in my blood when i talked to my doctor about this , he said there was no such thing as parasites in the blood when i found another doctor who did microscopy , he told me that i had more parasites in my blood stream than anyone he had ever tested after three months on the wormwood combination the parasites were gone , but i continued to take it for more than a year
