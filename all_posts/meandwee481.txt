hi friends ! today marks weeks for us , and i celebrated by having my first non stress test today the procedure seems pretty simple where i go into labor delivery and they put me in a room they use these belts to strap on my belly and we listen to the baby 's heartbeat and match it against any movement or contractions i guess the time to do this goes anywhere from minutes to one hour i had some apple juice while i lounged on the bed and watched tv that i did n't pay much attention to because i liked hearing little p 's heartbeat for so long but it 's scary when it starts to slow down normal and then speed way up it took some getting used to after some time , they sent me on my way after peeing in a cup for them per usual ! sidenote i 've gotten so good at peeing in cups i guess practice makes perfect maybe by next winter i 'll be able write my name in the snow the interesting tidbit from today i go in for this test twice per week every week not every weeks i go every week now until she 's born , and this replaces most all future doctor appointments since i 'll be so closely monitored so , i'm pretty much done with the visits to my ob 's office and all will take place at labor delivery luckily all my doctors are on call there at some point or another so it does n't really make a difference the other tidbit is that the doctor i spoke with today said they were worried for now but are being proactive and feel good about things he said they currently look great he said they will be less worried when i get to weeks or so so that 's only more weeks the impression i got is they are mostly worried about the vessel cord but also have some worry about my going into preterm labor because of the t shaped uterus issue once i hit weeks i'm in a much better position to have a healthy baby if preterm labor happens but , they deal with this sort of thing all the time it 's unsettling , yes , but i also know there is nothing i can really do except rest and take it easy things will be just fine right ? save you might also like it 's getting interesting weeks weeks linkwithin
