a fellow kda board member sent me the following story a couple of months ago at the time , i was not ready to really read it with some recent events , i pulled it out again and this time it hit home one day i hopped in a taxi and we took off for the airport we were driving in the right lane when suddenly a black car jumped out of a parking space right in front of us my taxi driver slammed on his breaks , skidded , and missed the other car by just inches ! the driver of the other car whipped his head around and started yelling at us my taxi driver just smiled and waved at the guy and i mean he was really friendly so i asked , why did you just do that ? this guy almost ruined your car and sent us both to the hospital ! this is when my taxi driver taught me the law of the garbage truck he explained , many people are like garbage trucks they run around full of garbage frustration , anger , resentment , and disappointment as their garbage piles up , they need a place to dump it sometimes they will dump it on you don t take it personally smile , wave , wish them well , and move on most importantly , don t take their garbage and spread it to other people the bottom line do not let garbage trucks take over your day life is too short to wake up in the morning with regrets in the end , love the people who treat you right and forget the ones who don t life is what you make it and how you take it ! as i have written before , the only handicap in life is a bad attitude
