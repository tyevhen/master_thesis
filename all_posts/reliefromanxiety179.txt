firstly , i am not a parent and nor do i have any experience of being a parent , thus i can only write this post from my perspective and what my parents and others did for me , that has helped me through my battles with mental illness i often get lots of tweets and emails about how people feel they cannot talk to their parents in the fear that they wo n't understand , they will look down on them , or they will just laugh at it and these stories often sadden me as a sufferer , it 's important to remember that what you 're going through is not your fault and if someone is willing to listen and try and understand , then that 's great i know it is hard to talk about your situation , but you may be surprised at how postively your parents may act and if they do n't , you could inform them on what you 're going through there are various websites out there that can help you with this as a parent , the most important thing you can do is be there for them and be a listening ear unfortunatly , even parents do n't sometimes have the answers the worst thing that a parent can do though in my opinion , is to just tell someone to get over it , to say it 's not real , to just think positively and to kind of ignore it this suggests to them , that mental health should n't be talked about and is bad , which of course is not the case after all , mental illness can kill just like a physical illness , so it 's important to take it seriously and not brush it aside in terms of getting help , there 's a range of services out there , which sometimes can be hard to find nevertheless , both the public and private sector have options to help all your child wants is support , so it 's always nice to know that a parent will support them through finding therapy , going to the doctors and taking medication , if that may be the case mental health is also a very sensitive subject , and hence why i think it 's important for my mental health to only be discussed with those i trust and not told to others which may make the situation worse , and to make me feel uncomfortable again , i am not a parent , but this has been the most beneficial for me let them know that you can talk to them , even if you may feel awkward about it discussing what kind of support each person wants whilst going through these mental health issues , is also important what makes the person feel safe ? what makes them feel comfortable ? as i'm sure many sufferers can relate , we do n't want to be smothered with mental health talk all of the time ! but , battling mental illness is often too difficult to cope with on your own and this why a support network is beneficial i know it 's hard for both sides , but trying your best to talk is a great step in the road to recovery you can do this ! i 'll leave you with a video , which may help begin your conversation on mental health http t co wdnapofu amy xx
