i invite you to participate in this project if you 're a grown unschooler , and i invite everyone who 's interested in reading more about grown unschoolers to check out this list of interviews enjoy ! i am the self designin' , life lovin' , free mama to kassidy , noble , and najaia i have many interests that include personal growth , spirituality , beauty , simplicity , creative outlets , crafting , and other diy projects we are a whole life unschooling family , and i walk a path toward gentle parenting while i undo the tangles of my past we generally value natural and sustainable living , so this is very reflected in some areas of our life and in some areas or choices not so much without judgment we are enjoying liberating ourselves from villainous thinking about all kinds of things that bring us joy we are a very eclectic family , as we pick and chose what fits for each of us at any given moment we strive to listen to our inner selves over outer experts some of us have an easier time of this , but it sure is fun peeling back the layers and resituating paradigms community is very important to us and we look forward to living communally in a tight knit tribe more than ever since gathering a couple times a week with our local radical unschooling group ! when did you become an unschooler ? halfway through my freshmen year of high school , my mom took me and my brother out of school to homeschool on the road we had homeschooled before , while she worked at super sales and state fairs our travels ended up being our curriculum how long have you unschooled did you unschool ? ever since , even though i chose to do an adult high school program years later and go on to college about years after attaining my diploma how old are you now ? do you have any siblings ? if so , did they do they unschool as well ? i have a younger brother who lived and travelled with us and unschooled he was years younger than me , and he went back to public school seamlessly if your parents chose unschooling , do you know how why they made that decision ? like i said , my mom just did n't do curriculum , mostly because we were so busy living she had never heard of the term unschooling until i found it and started with my kids what do you think the best thing about unschooling is ? i attribute unschooling to my insatiable love of learning , both in life and in formal education it was done for intrinsic reasons , totally self guided what do you think the worst or most difficult thing about unschooling is ? the hardest part for me was not feeling like it was normal i did n't know anyone else who did it , and i got the impression from society that mom was just irresponsible and crazy unconventional did you decide to go are you going to college or university ? if so , could you talk a bit about that experience ? i did decide to go to college i loved the community college level as was evident in my gpa , but once i transferred to the university level , it became more about the degree than the wonderful stuff that it had been about before , and i slowly did worse and worse i got accepted to a school for my master 's degree and decided to not go and live some life i 'd like to go back to school someday , maybe but i know i do n't need it to be successful , to live a rich and fulfilling life , and i do n't give my kid 's these impressions either do you feel that unschooling has had an impact on what methods of earning money or jobs you 're drawn to ? absolutely ! i can only work a job that is intrinsically rewarding , and i know that i will always be okay by following my passions my idea of a career is combining as many of my interests into money making forms , and is totally unconventional but the best part is that i am comfortable with the fact that this will probably change over and over as i live what impact do you feel unschooling has had on your life ? one of the biggest i have already said that i attribute it to my insatiable love of learning , but it is also one of the most learning filled times of my life those years that we traveled were full of so much people learning , as we visited a new state almost every week or sometimes worked a state fair that lasted a month or so at a time i spent so much time getting to learn about people and the different cultures of america because we were often at state fairs , we got to see the best of each culture we traveled and got to see so many places and learned about the history of this country first hand it has impacted how i raise my children we unschool and are currently making plans to buy a home on wheels and travel until we decide not to , and see whatever our wheels will take us to see if you could go back in time , is there anything about your learning educational journey that you 'd change ? the only thing i might change but i love my journey and would n't really change anything is i would have learned about the term unschooling sooner , and maybe been introduced to authors like john holt if you have children , are they unschooled ? alternately , if you were to have children , would you choose to unschool them ? i do have kids i was a single mom with my oldest , so did n't think it was possible to homeschool her , until my son was born and i found a way to stay home , and i 've found a way since we are going on years what advice would you give to teens looking to leave high school ? just do it find support of some kind , and never look back what advice would you give to someone looking to skip , or to drop out of , college or university ? follow your heart there are so many other ways to learn that are cheaper ! and to earn a living you can go back if you realllly want to what advice would you give to unschooling parents or parents looking into unschooling ? as an unschooled kid , the world is full of so much that a school cannot give depth and breadth barely recognized as a fellow unschool parent , i would say research your doubts because you will probably find that those things are n't really a problem once you 've heard some differing perspectives on it all the internet makes all things possible
