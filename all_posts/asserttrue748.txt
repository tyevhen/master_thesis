i 've found , over the years , that in almost every successful field of technology there 's a killer app , a category leader so strong as to be universally understood as the archetype of success in a given domain conversely , when a technology lacks a killer app , it tends to be very telling it says something about the future of that technology take java , for example when java first arrived , there were high hopes for its success based on the write once , run anywhere mantra applets started showing up all over the web but on the desktop , no killer apps and even in the applet world , no killer apps , just a bunch of little games and academic demos java 's killer app , the thing that would ensure its place in history , did n't really arrive until something called jee so when a new technology space like ria comes along , with contenders having fancy names like air , silverlight , or javafx , i sit back and wait for a killer app to emerge , signalling the appearance of a likely winner or at least a contender with a future ahead of it in the multi way battle javafx was late to the party , so i continue to give it the benefit of the doubt , but it looks stillborn to me at this point and i think the oracle acquisition of sun may delay progress with javafx until far past the point where it can regain ground against adobe flex air one thing we can all agree on is that there is no killer javafx app in fact i ca n't even name a javafx app not a single one but it 's too early , someone will say to the contrary , my friend it may be too late silverlight has the full mass and motive power of the microsoft juggernaut behind it , and for that reason we ca n't dismiss it yet but again , where are the killer apps ? should n't we have seen one by now ? should n't it be possible to walk up behind someone at any gathering of programmers , tap a total stranger on the shoulder , and get an immediate answer to the question can you name a really cool silverlight app ? yes , it 's early and then there 's adobe with its shiny new air technology , built atop half open , half closed flash and flex infastructure , an alluring platform with the not inconsiderable advantage of being built , largely , on actionscript hormone enriched javascript it 's fun , it 's pretty , it 's new but where are the killer apps ? actually , there 's a class of killer apps built around air now maybe you 've noticed ? it 's called the twitter client tweetdeck , twhirl , alertthingy , toro , the list goes on and on many of these are not just twitter clients , of course some are perhaps better called social clients , since they interact with other services besides twitter does this mean adobe has won the ria wars ? no , of course not but it sure has a nice head start what we need to see now is whether additional killer app categories start to emerge around air if air progresses beyond the point of supporting fun little soco apps , things could get very interesting for users of cell phones , palm devices , pcs , netbooks , laptops , readers , and who knows what else in a hurry if not if air remains the province of waist slimming twitter clients and zero calorie rss feed readers then we may have yet another evolutionary dead end along the lines of dare i say it ? java man time will tell
