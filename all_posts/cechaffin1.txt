to rise spine straight i gazed at the cloud cover back hued with light and wished to be translated in moment , in the twinkling of an eye lord take me i said as the calendulas threw praise and bright blue lobelia exploded skyward while poppies raised their jagged leaves , bulbs heavy with sap milky as semen as the tufted grass extended its spiny crowns to the mottled light take me i said , take me , i am an open armed child reaching past the apple tree past blooming , whose green limbs strain in transpiration of invisible incense offered to the invisible yes to rise to god s pocket where the loose change of saints jangles in praise , up to the white gold light above the many fingered lupine leaves and thick heather of a thousand blossoms both clawing , crying for lost stars behind the sheer undergarments of clouds thinned to diaphones dizzy from a cigarette i thought i would rise and nearly floated up , past the demons chorus in my intransigent head , nearly i joined the praise of yellow nasturtiums and pink sea thrift for the dissipating light wreathed in wisps of vapor , the thin creamery of clouds i might have been free , i would have been free from a thousand eventualities sucking at my feet , weighing me down with inconsequential harvests of chronic indecision , the gum of existence , but this poem like a million poems only echoes the imaginary chrysalis from which we might be born and ends with a whimpering bang
