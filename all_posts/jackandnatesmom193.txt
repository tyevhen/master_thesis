i have been missing nate like bunches it is a huge change to have him out of the house basically from am to pm it gives me new appreciation for my job and the fact that i was able to have the boys nearby for so long he is getting what he needs in this current situation but here 's the thing now whenever i have nate with me , jack is there too i used to have at least an hour and a half in the afternoons with just nate not so anymore i can give jack attention with nate around but i have a very difficult time doing the reverse nate just cannot compete with jack 's volume level and extreme verbosity and frankly , even when he tries i just ca n't hear him thursdays especially stink jack has ot at pm so i get him off the bus at , drive directly to cisco center , get nate , fly home , shove some food down their throats , wait for john to get home , then drive jack over to ot it 's close to by the time we get home , and we take the boys up for baths at pm blah so tonight we made it home right at , and i figured that since it 's finally light out quite a bit later i would just go ahead and take nate just nate for a walk i love to listen to him babble and if you listen really carefully , there are words in there his verbal development is really unusual , i guess because he is n't always using language as a way to communicate with others , being that he 's happy in his own little world but his little sing songy talking while we were walking did have some words kind of thrown in there i would never have heard them if jack was with us the other issue has been that when i take both boys to the playground it 's just not fun jack remains terrified of anything that buzzes including all flying insects i took both boys to the playground around the corner last weekend and jack would not get out of my lap because there is a trash can on the playground , and thus bugs so nate and i stopped at that playground , just the two of us , this evening i pushed him on the swing and played with him on the shaking bridge which he loves it was just so nice to be with my littlest son , to be able to hear him and give him my undivided attention so simple , right ? here are some pics from our play date the poor kid is doomed to wear airplane shirts for the rest of time hand me downs from big brother
