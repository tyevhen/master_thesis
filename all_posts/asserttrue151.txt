americans are an optimistic lot that 's what the research says , anyway when the folks at pewresearch org polled , people in countries , asking them how their day was going , they got answers that correlated inversely with gdp by way of background , pew notes as part of the pew research center s annual global attitudes survey , this question is usually the first we pose to respondents in all the countries we survey one reason we ask such a milquetoast question first is to help the respondents become more comfortable with the interviewer the vast majority of the polls we conduct are done with face to face interviews in the respondent s home , and asking about their day is one way to kick off the conversation what pew found is that if you come from a comparatively poor country like el salvador , you 're more likely to say you 're having a good day the wealthier your country , the less likely it is you 'll say you 're having a particularly good day the outlier here is the united states the u s has the highest gdp of any country on the chart , and yet people answer the how 's your day ? question as if they live in tanzania maybe a lot of us , in our heads , feel like we 're living in tanzania or maybe americans just have a different attitude when asked , on a scale of to , how important working hard is to getting ahead in life , of americans said it is was a or very important , compared with a global median of among the nations americans really do believe in the american dream , even though reality says the dream is largely a myth evidence on the latter comes from something now well known to economists as the great gatsby curve the gatsby chart is often attributed to alan krueger , who used it in a memorable speech in , but it actually comes from university of ottawa 's miles corak it plots an intergenerational earnings correlation on the y axis against something known as the gini index on the x axis the intergenerational earnings index correlates how much you earn with how much your parents earn it 's meant to be a proxy for class mobility the idea is that if you live in a land of equal opportunity , there should be little correlation between what the kids of a rich person earn and what the kids of poor parents earn , whereas in a land of less opportunity , you will earn in accordance with what social class you were born into the gini index measures wealth inequality , or deviation from equal wealth distribution the graph shows that for the ten countries in question , intergenerational earnings correlate strongly r squared with wealth inequality , and the worst country of the bunch , for both class mobility and wealth inequality , is the united states if you wanted to write a dissertation on how the american dream is n't working , this is one of the graphs you 'd use in your thesis the graph has been criticized by right wing flag wavers based on the quality and relevancy of the data standard ploys from the flag waver ploybook criticize the data in hopes of undermining the conclusion , but in fact , you can find various versions of this chart all over the internet , some with more points on it , and the more points you put on the graph the stronger the relationship looks in all likelihood , if you could find better data for the points , the relationship would get stronger , not weaker , so the idea that this graph does n't really show a strong relationship is silly it turns out there are countries with greater wealth inequality and worse mobility than the u s they 're places like peru and chile , countries where coincidentally people on the street are optimistic paradoxically , i think pew is right and i think krueger is right wealth disparity is real if you 're a denialist on this , you 're just plain wrong the data are overwhelming , equal opportunity is a fading myth , and americans do n't care they believe what they want to believe , which is that you can better yourself it 's a healthy belief system , the kind of belief system you need if you 're in desperate straits the kind you 're lucky to have , if you have it have you checked out my free book mental health myths debunked ?
