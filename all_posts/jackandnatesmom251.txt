people often ask me how i am able to focus on my work with these two little boogers running around here well , first and foremost , i am the champion of blocking out noises after over years of doing it also , there 's school i love school but really , there 's just nothing like the amazing atmosphere and priveleges associated with working from home oh and the facilities , you just ca n't compare , really you ca n't this is the nastiest , smelliest , most unorganized area of our home this is where i work if you look closely , you will see the beer bottle my husband left when he came to check on the furnace the other night all those papers ? my job is completely paperless those are the kids medical and school records ahhhh my space and just in case i get bored , there 's lots to do i can work out if i can clear all the laundry and boxes away or more likely , i can do laundry just have to make sure i turn off the washing machine before i make a call the really convenient thing about this particular office space is that with the hvac directly behind me i have a ton of white noise , and i can barely even hear the kids even when they scream kidding then of course there is the office staff the book keeper tech support he 's on his break and of course , security he keeps the mailman and ups man at bay daily thank god for that if all else fails , there is an incredible sense of team spirit amoung the staff happy friday everyone ! ! ! ! !
