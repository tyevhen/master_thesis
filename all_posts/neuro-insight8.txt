neurofeedback saved my life over thirteen years ago , it now feels ages but , back then , it was my nightmare after i gave birth to my third child , i was caught by sever post partum depression and i mean , i was really caught by it life did n't feel what it felt before everything blurred , emotions running up and down and not being able to handle life at all everything was messed up inside my head my brain was completely shut down i got lost in the city i had been living in for years i could not have a small conversation i felt like a living death with a baby , a toddler and a year old i had a nurse with me during the day and she helped me with everything , simply because i was n't able to do anything i could not believe this was happening to me i mean , i am a well educated and happy person no reason to feel like that , and still i did day after day , week after week , month after month passed by i became desperate , and so did my husband because i had decided not to use any medication we were constantly looking at alternatives to recover from this dreadfull family situation one year later , the baby girl had grown into a wonderful one year old happy girl , not aware of the state her mother , i , was in it happened one year later one year of misery inside my brain , lost the will to live one year later i accidentaly ran into someone who owned a neuroptimal system back then it was still called neurocare he offered me a session i do believe in miracles , because , the moment the session was over , and it was just one session , i could already notice the difference a little bit of sunshine was able to get through my massive brainfog one sunray it made me come back for more i had nine sessions , and that was it i was back in charge ! and more , i decided i had to have neuroptimal in my home , simply because i wanted to become even better , not being aware that , now , twelve years after that very difficult time , i would run a private practise offering neuroptimal neurofeedback as a tool for my work as a therapist every day i enjoy using the system , now in order to help others if i had n't neuroptimal in my life , i probably would not have wanted to live it was a life saver for me , and , after so many years and so many clients , it probably has saved more lives than mine alone hannie read more on my website i still train my own brain twice a week
