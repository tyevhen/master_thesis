posted by dinah i checked the blog yesterday was surprised to find three , count 'em , three new posts by roy ! is he manic , i wondered ? oh , probably not just unleashing his pent up blogs which have been festering i can only speculate but this brings me to an interesting study i found , one that pertains to roy 's comments on most frequent diagnoses among psychiatric patients a landmark study by sille , et al revealed that the most common psychiatric diagnosis among bloggers is , in fact , bipolar disorder , accounting for of all psychiatric diagnoses most recent episode being a mixed state , followed by obsessive compulsive disorder , with compulsive writing being the most common symptom , followed by compulsive email checking in a follow up study done by monke in , it was found in a randomized , placebo controlled , double blind study that manic bloggers were more likely to report remission of symptoms , a return to euthymia , and a decrease in compulsive blogging , when treated with a combination of depakote , chocolate and caffeine interestingly enough , none of the bloggers studied responded to either lithium or any of the novel anti psychotic agents okay , so i made it all up , but i had fun doing it !
