i feel like crying as you may have noticed from the obnoxious countdown at the top of this page , the deadline to apply for may graduation was yesterday i did not apply defeat there 's always august , but this delay has really kicked the wind out of my gumption so today i am trying to rally i am on campus trying to still finish my corrections on my lit review it is not going well and one of my old students by pure , old fashioned bad luck sat down across from me she is staring at me i am actively ignoring her gods of thesis writing , please deliver me from this trial i beseech you the above picture by banksy illustrates how i feel today does a transition from pie in the face to dead flowers mean that things are getting worse ?
