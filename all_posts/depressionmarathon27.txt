i'm making some progress both mentally and physically , i think i just came in from a mile walk with jet during our walk , i jogged i hate the j word , but that 's what it was a bit to see how my left leg was faring after walking a little over a mile , i jogged slowly and gently for one tenth of a mile later i jogged two tenths of a mile twice it was slow and tentative , but it was kind of like running because of my weak ankle , i was unable to land on my left heel , so i felt like i was tiptoeing rather than fully running i also had cramping in my hamstrings and calves , likely as a result of them compensating for my weak hip and quads nonetheless , i believe i jogged better today than the last time i tried a few weeks ago it felt a little easier , and my leg felt a tiny bit stronger unfortunately , any gains i 've made have been so small it 's hard to tell if my leg is actually stronger or not that 's why i wanted to try running a bit tonight i'm feeling a little encouraged by the results but i'm being cautiously hopeful i have to be cautious , as nerve injuries are different and difficult unlike other injuries which have kept me from running in the past , injuries which i knew would heal with the right treatment , time , and exercises this injury has no such guarantees with a nerve injury , my progress can stop at any time regardless of how much work i do or how much time passes that 's the scary reality of having an injured nerve i'm praying i'm still making some gains but only time will tell mentally i think i'm also making some progress i had my fifth ketamine infusion on thursday my mood had n't been great all week , but i felt better after the infusion that was a relief and i'm still feeling lighter today i'm grateful i have two more infusions left before my participation in the study will be complete i'm praying for continued improvement i 'd really like to walk away from my last infusion , just under two weeks from now , feeling confident and back to normal that would be truly wonderful
