things continue to go well here i'm feeling well i'm back to running i'm working at least days per week , and i'm staying on top of my bills , errands and chores it 's the simple things when the simple things in life are actually simple i know i'm doing well i'm stacking one good day on top of another that may be boring for you to read , but it sure is cool to be experiencing it today i had a very good run it was n't an easy run , but i'm so satisfied with accomplishing what i set out to do i set out to run at least miles i know that may have been a foolish goal , as i have n't run that far in several weeks , but sometimes i'm foolish what can i say ? it was crisp and clear when jet and i set out this morning having run miles without walk breaks a few days ago , i hoped to run at least that far before taking a short walk break today in the beginning my legs were tired my left knee was a little sore my right achilles was a little tight i was worried i had set my sights too high those aches and worries made for a challenging first few miles , but i persevered i battled my brain and my fatigue , and things improved i ran right through my mile walk break in fact , i ran right through my mile goal i finished one hour and forty five minutes after i started , and i ran a total of miles no walk breaks i was smiling a very big smile when i arrived home i enjoy challenging myself i seem to thrive when i have a goal for which to shoot that 's one of the reasons i run marathons aiming my running toward that long term goal gives me motivation and direction and i need direction growing up as an athlete my workouts and practices were always geared toward a future goal i doubt i will ever be someone who exercises just for the heck of it there 's nothing wrong with exercising for exercise sake , but i think i 'd lose interest pretty quickly i need a goal today i set and met my goal that felt good the goal kept me going i'm so glad to back running life is good my goal tonight is to continue stacking one good day upon another i hope you will , too
