i'm having trouble getting readjusted to my life after my short vacation up north last weekend it may not have been a long vacation , but apparently it had a major impact it did n't help that my supervisor cancelled me on monday so i had an extra day off with which to do nothing and that 's pretty much what i did i continued my weekend of relaxation and did little of anything productive on monday oh , i ran to the grocery store and rode my stationary bike for minutes but not much else got done it was a continuation of the laziness which i enjoyed over the weekend unfortunately i am no longer enjoying the laziness , which also extended into yesterday besides an appointment in the morning , i did n't leave the house yesterday , and i did n't much care i think my mood is low , but not so low as to be scary yet , just low enough to lack the motivation to accomplish anything dysthymia i believe that 's the official term i do n't like it thankfully , i worked today so i had to get dressed and out of the house it was difficult getting going it was tough getting out of the house even after i arrived at my work site , i had to sit in the parking lot for awhile to build up the gumption to go inside once i was inside and treating my patients , i was fine but the blahs returned as soon as i got home this afternoon i want to go back on vacation i miss the lakes , my friends , and my family it 's a little strange i 've not felt this way previously , and i 've been up north multiple times i do n't know what 's different this time maybe it 's my injury preventing me from running i 've got a lot more time on my hands maybe it 's delayed grieving after my break up with my boyfriend it 's been over a month since we split , so that seems far fetched , but who knows ? maybe it 's just plain old depression anything is possible , i guess whatever is going on , i hope i get past it soon i'm not enjoying this longing to be elsewhere i hate the low energy and lack of motivation , and missing my friends sucks i feel lonely it 's hard to enjoy anything i'm finding it tough to get anything done heck , i'm finding it tough to get off the couch ! i know this too shall pass i just wish it would pass soon
