has anyone hear of the sloth ? a sloth sleeps an average of hours a day and tends to just lay around on branches when awake a koala sleeps an average of hours i believe i have met something even lazier than those creatures my son of course he does not sleep to hours a day , but if left to his own devices , he would play video games while lying on the couch for hours a day , not eating , eliminating where is is and enjoying the warmth and sleep for the remainder my son 's room is filled with trash he does not clean is room and is too lazy to bring the garbage to a trash can so he just drops it on the floor he does this everywhere in the house but i pick up the other rooms i do not pick up his room on a regular basis , cleaning up after him is thoroughly exhausting he leaves stuff lying around , anything lying around anywhere , and asking him to pick up his own things is a major production the conversation required to get him to pick up his stuff requires so much energy that i wind up mentally exhausted after asking him to bring his plate to the sink that is when he used a plate many foods he will not use a plate as that would require the energy necessary to open a cupboard door and grab a plate rather he walks around , eating the food and leaving a trail of crumbs please note my son will not vacuum my son does not want to take a bath or shower because it demands too much energy and he does not get enjoyment out of those activities he also is not big on changing clothes he does not even remove his clothes for sleeping he will often wear the same clothes day in day out for days he eventually changes them because he is tired of hearing me nag but i have to nag a lot ! my son has enuresis , but he does not change his underwear for days at times he will wear dirty urine soaked underwear for weeks if we let him he also will not change his sheets or clean his mattress he keeps his dirty sheets in his room until we go in there and remove them he could just take them out and throw them into the laundry room from upstairs he does n't even need to go downstairs i even suspect that he pees in bed just because he is too lazy to get up we have cats my son loves the cats , yet he does not want to clean the cat litter boxes i have even switched two of the litter boxes to the non clumping kind so he does not have to sift every day and bought a self sifting one for the cats which prefer the clumping kind but dumping the used litter once a week into the green bin is too much work he complains that doing the cat litter is destroying his sense of smell , yet sleeping in his own urine is fine my son expects me to wash his clothes , clean his room , do the dishes , pick up his stuff , cook his food , cook really good and rich food , do the cat litters , buy him everything he wants and desires , go to work and work overtime , do the groceries , shovel , feed the animals and so much more , yet none of that is work for me it 's all easier for me than for him , even though i have cfs , fms , bp and currently have an entrapped ulnar nerve , and a severely sprained ankle we are currently packing and getting ready to move even though he is almost , he ca n't pack his own room it 's not that he ca n't , it 's that he is too effen lazy to do it and knows perfectly well that come moving day , if it 's not done yet , someone will do it for him he also knows that i will be obligated to have his room cleaned eventually , under the law , so there is no need for him to do it he knows that i have no power whatsoever to enforce anything and to those parents that think they do , you are delusional your power rests in your children 's willingness to give it to you if they do n't give it to you , you have none my son has qualified for giftedness , even though he has a learning disorder he is in a behaviour modification class with intellectually challenged kids because he is too lazy to bother trying to learn has has no ambition whatsoever , and asking him anything with get you an i do n't know as thinking about anything is just too much work he can do these things , he chooses not to i get that my son has a developmental delay and that he has adhd and odd , but those are just the icing on the cake they do n't fully explain nor justify his total and utter laziness well thanks for reading my rant have a good day update do n't know what happened to him on the day i wrote this but he was being helpful ! gotta give credit where credit is due he did some chores for me
