what we need to do in psychotherapy is to rid ourselves of a class of elite cognoscenti who are the center of all psychologic knowledge the patient is the only one who has knowledge of her unconscious we therapists can only guess at it when we operate on theories that are constructed out of the unconscious of psychologists rather than based on the internal reality of the patient , we become tinkering mechanics , altering our techniques more out of whimsy than science until now , there has been no theoretical web that encompasses both psychology and neurology , although there have been attempts to join psychoanalysis with neurology it is , by and large , a shotgun wedding it is the same as plastering an old outdated notion onto new science and hoping it will stick if psychoanalysis ignores key internal realities , it doesn t matter that we adhere certain neurologic facts to it it cannot work why would we take a theory one hundred years old and join with it research that may be six months old ? the marriage can t last the groom is far too old for the bride who has new ideas and new information the youngster is trying to lead the old man but the old man is too feeble to keep up better a young theory that works within neurologic principles
