not poetry another manuscript goes out today of my best poems the orphans need a home more permanent than all my journal play they need a book that they can call their own the stigma of self publishing is gone , or so i m told by those content to print the exhalations they insist are song , not fearing their own talent counterfeit but i persist in contests why i do is either born of stubbornness or hope that some fey judge will grasp the master clue to verify my genius and my scope this sonnet is n't poetry but verse , a morning discipline that i rehearse as the reader may see from this desultory sonnet i am not much inspired today , and in casting about for a subject i chose my preparation of yet another manuscript of poetry to enter in a contest , the t s eliot prize if there s ever a prize i d like to win , this would be it , as t s eliot has been a pleasurable obsession of mine for more than three decades the ms i ve been putting together flaunts the custom of my other three , only one of which has been published as a book there is no theme , no divisions , no attempt at a unifying rubric for the collection i just chose the best poems i think i ve written on any subject and put them in alphabetic order with a few modifications with the completion of this entry , given the title unexpected light by my editor , kathleen , i now have three different manuscripts floating around in contest land as each of these contests receive or more manuscripts , on a pure statistical basis i have an chance of winning each of them , though i hope my talent and hard work might boost me to the top , increasing my chances to what makes such contests so hard to predict is the changing judges dana gioia and diane wakowski are going to bring very different sensibilities to judging , thus the winner , once the mss are narrowed down , will be that lucky poet who pleases a poet with a body of work and unavoidable biases i know my poems are fairly retro , as most of them make some kind of sense though not all in the post modern wasteland my work may appear as a discarded mcdonald s wrapper useful only for the delectation of a seagull but on i go , and i have never so aggressively pursued prizes in my life as i am doing now i will keep entering until i run out of money or they run out of patience meanwhile there are other avenues of publishing to explore , but i hesitate to self publish , because that makes one ineligible for many more prizes , like the pulitzer , which i no doubt richly deserve for my contribution to seagulls moodwise i m still fragile the change in time doesn t help , with the early darkness i have been one acquainted with the night frost i am better , certainly , but still suffer the mad chatter of my anti self telling me that i m no good this only has power over me when i m already anxious or fearful , and i get so tired of the record i want to put a corkscrew through my ear and grind my brain to soup but kathleen wouldn t like that , and besides , thanksgiving s coming up , so i ll desist for now brain gravy just ain t popular kilorats , ce
