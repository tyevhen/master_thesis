last week new york times article rather interesting title doctors strive less harm inattentive care written gina kolata amazing idea doctors spend time listening patients aside i glad i psychiatrist psychotherapist doctors acknowledge people hospitals may suffering illnesses perhaps also insensitive treatment inflicted blood draws unnecessary noise kolata writes found several categories communications example doctor blurting oh looks like cancer losing valuable like wedding ring loss privacy doctor discussing patient medical condition adjacent patient could hear harms dr sands said elicit suffering long lasting currently largely unquantified uncounted unrecorded let me tell article caught attention i like help input bear me little bit readers know working book committed battle forced psychiatric care research involuntary psychiatric care even coerced care voluntary care i heard people talk traumatizing treatment everyone says even people people sensitive care callous i finding little care unnecessarily brutal really gotten much better recent years people rarely restrained average psychiatric unit i peeking mostly empty seclusion rooms asking lots questions regulations restrict sometimes really still necessary much like say psychiatric patients dangerous kill people psychiatric hospitals necessarily safest places one forensic hospital state one year period three patients killed patients one community hospital patient poked eye nurse staff assaulted regularly even blogger clinkshrink punched head patient prior contact reason assault leaving unit clink patient second assault victim day let move away extreme cases violence patients traumatized benign things asked participate activities feel therapeutic feeling miserable depressed would rather stay bed nurses shine flashlights tally hours sleep lack privacy constant sense trusted i ca belt unit i like pants stay patients control temperature rooms volume programing tv foods fed exercise simply take walk outside wine dinner smoke sex urge strikes appropriate love partner may know consequences might refusing swallow medication makes nervous ingest circumstances injected medications may find treatment disrespectful demeaning things great answers staff ca magically predict dangerous sometimes concessions comfort human rights obviously everyone held restraints might people allowed leave unit usually nothing bad happens believe me everyone remembers something really bad happen many patients leave hospital much better depression started lift agitation quelled suicidal terrified delusional events never happening hearing voices sleeping eating better irritable manic uncontainable yet much better people feel violated angry transpired name getting help maybe lack insight i want wonder i like input cancer patients ms kolata wrote field little research people different simply know gets distressed might mitigate distress i wonder would help exit interview listen treatment made patients suffer listen throw people faces done embarrassingly control acknowledge treatment difficult hard endure times simply validate distress patient felt without assignment blame either party i going go one step farther please hang me i recently spent day wonderful mental health court judge know nothing mental health court short version people psychiatric disorders offered opportunity plead guilty participate mental health treatments successfully avoid serving time jail cases record cleared people committed crimes team like hospital team social workers prosecutors defenders amazing probation officers comprehensive services put together include drug treatment clinic appointments vocational rehab housing weekly check ins probation officer talks everyone patient psychiatrist patient mom legal system taking medical role person head table judge attending psychiatrist i tell i found really weird know behind scenes public discussion later however quick public court hearing defendants come court month going well court celebratory feel quick report judge congratulations defendant job well done may applause may certificates defendant asked anything wants add subpoena given next month criminals yet successes simply lack failures compliance recommended treatments celebrated publicly acknowledged every months graduation ceremony finish terms probation food served families come boyfriends girlfriends come photos taken judges good people happy given opportunity get treatment turn lives around would help people left psychiatric hospital feeling badly violated perhaps certainly shamed something hear even patient nothing shameful listened acknowledged difficult get treatment participate let people know tremendous job done getting difficult time even graceful would help celebration someone discharged even pizza cake something little healthier bring family print certificate read aloud make shame obviously might nice i want know would reasonable shot might mitigate trauma hospitalization might lessen sense violation reduce idea illness remitted another hospitalization needed would necessarily bad i love hear think i wrong i love know think might make easier adjustment less dwelling injustice yes time i interested hearing patients hospitalized thank much
