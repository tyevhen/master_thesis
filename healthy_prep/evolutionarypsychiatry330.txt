let begin harvard mental health letter april page hmhl loves rain diet mental health parade researchers long disagreed whether gastrointestinal problems may underlie symptoms autism spectrum disorders stopped researchers celebrities promoting theories special autism diets scientific support yet unfounded recommendations might appeal grieving vulnerable parents heartbroken child sudden developmental regression wow harsh i hope use next several posts explore theories behind might causing austim see wacky dangerous diets really autism spectrum disorders autistic disorder asperger disorder rett disorder childhood disintegrative disorder pervasive developmental disorder otherwise specified together known asds seem impair child ability communicate interact people asds also characterized ritualistic repetitive behaviors tapping fingers head banging picking autistic children general picky children without asds temper tantrums around unsatisfactory meal times extreme decent point restricting picky child menu going gluten casein free could nutritional issue constipation also common among kids autism seems kids asds frequently experience abdominal pain stool leakage bloating reflux harvard mental health letter blunt point enough evidence support special autism diets eliminate casein gluten previous studies properly done small even use standard measures diagnose autism first place one double blind crossover trial casein gluten free vs regular diets sure really double blind okay children asds weeks diet seemed effect parents felt intervention trial successful independent reviewers right right get picture harvard mental health letter let step back bit autism causes well universal theory consistent genetic findings though autism seem run families sometimes agreed upon biological mechanism causes autism researchers feel brain development problem others wonder autism set disorders similar phenylketonuria inability metabolize certain amino acid lead progressive mental retardation brain damage seizures averted eating amino acid phenylalanine whole idea gluten free casein free diets might useful autism based theories exorphins protein fragments opiates gluten casein might make intestinal barrier go brain causing harm similar theory work gluten free diets schizophrenia one interesting tidbit information kids autism family members seem leakier guts families without autism finding makes harvard mental health letter statement researchers promoting autism diets scientific support seem well cranky fair largest best gluten free casein free diet trial published april leaky gut study i looking epublished ahead print meaning seem even officially published yet wait minute back one measure leaky gut well test gut integrity one drink solution metabolically inert sugars like lactulose mannitol person leaky gut sugars end urine called ipt test addition leaky gut tends inflamed gut one skip intestinal biopsies check fecal calprotectin fc protein produced intestinal granulocytes lots fc poop apparently means probably inflamed bowel course celiac disease associated inflamed leaky guts researchers study took kids autism spectrum disorders first degree relatives also children adult controls everyone given ipt test checked fc kids autism screened celiac using anti ttg antibodies igg anti gliadin antibodies iga anti gliadin antibodies anti endomysium antibodies genetic testing hla dq relatives controls abnormal ipt fc tests similarly screened celiac sounds interesting results abnormal leaky gut ipt test higher percentage lactulose mannitol urine adult controls child controls asd patients relatives p pathological fecal calprotectin fc measure gut inflammation asd patients relatives due budget constraints fc measured controls abnormal ipt test none fc values normal range asd patients celiac testing genetic predisposition celiac hla dq dq kids leaky ipt test genetic predisposition celiac hla dq dq kids normal ipt test gastrointestinal symptoms kids leaky ipt test gastrointestinal symptoms kids normal ipt test positive aga iga positive aga igg positive ttg ema negative relatives celiac testing positive aga iga positive aga igg positive ttg ema negative well mixed bag overall findings seems subgroup kids autism close relatives leaky guts celiac findings little place gi symptoms seemed correlation gut leakiness meaning standard recommendation investigate celiac intestinal barrier problems autistic kids gi symptoms seems fly face scientific findings perhaps importantly gluten augments ipt words makes gut leakiness worse cellular models hypothesize subjects asd gluten sensitive hence intestinal barrier function abnormalities ameliorate gluten free diet well recognized intestinal mucosal effects gliadin major component gluten would justify treatment gluten free diet asd lot discuss i leave information simmer little bottom line post clinical trials evidence gluten free casein free diets poor far though i go i consider best study later week newer evidence rather large subset kids asds especially leaky gut susceptibility leakiness seems genetic going find kids looking patients celiac markers looking patients gi symptoms
