pertussis also known whooping cough highly contagious respiratory infection caused bordetella pertussis small aerobic bacterium secretes numerous toxins capable disrupting normal immune response disease rarely fatal leaves victims nasty cough last weeks cases pertussis reported cdc cases fatal contrast americans killed lightning year bordetella pertussis unlike tuberculosis million years bordetella shows evidence fairly new still rapidly evolving pathogen although case fairly new could still mean years complete dna sequence pertussis available several years shows moderate size genome million base pairs encoding genes substantial number pseudogenes latter represent genes one means another inactivated whether appearance premature stop codons gene loss promoter region random deletions makes bordetella pseudogenes interesting remarkably good shape pseudogenes go usually gene gets inactivated goes pseudo begins accumulate random point mutations deletions insertions etc substantial rate words deteriorates since supposedly longer selection pressure australian researchers looked pseudogenes pertussis tohama i strain shocked find rate nucleotide polymorphisms i changes individual base pairs dna actually lower pseudogenes regular genes per site versus exactly opposite expected researchers commented somewhat laconically suggests pseudogenes pertussis formed recent past yet accumulate mutations functional genes explanation well obvious alternative explanation genes still selection pressure even though turned i think number scenarios perhaps future blog post suffice say ribosomes totally unforgiving missing stop codons read tmrna unforgiving cases frameshifts read programmed frameshifts open reading frame appear pseudogene antisense strand rna silencer potentially remaining good copy copies gene attendant gene modulation possibilities worth pointing pseudogenes leprae leprosy bacterium conserved ancient continue show strong homology working orthologues tuberculosis even distantly related organisms gordonia corynebacterium nocardia millions years later post i thought might worth looking base composition pertussis pseudogenes see riddled frameshift errors case leprae pseudogenes i analyzed codons normal pseudo genes pertussis tohama i strain resulting paintball diagram base composition came looking like paintball diagram normal genes pertussis tohama i click enlarge red dots codon base one gold represents composition codon base two blue wobble third base composition every dot represents statistics one gene see text discussion looking purine content versus content base position codons every dot represents gene worth data unexpectedly extreme values occur third wobble base codon base one red dots purine rich centering typical codons genes organisms notice breakaway cloud gold points underneath main gold cloud points represent genes second codon base mostly pyrimidine codons pyrimidine base two tend code nonpolar amino acids thus breakaway cloud gold points represents membrane associated proteins case looking genes falling category look paintball diagram organism pseudogenes base composition codons pseudogenes pertussis tohama i click enlarge graph one dots rendered opacity overlapping points less likely obscure see text discussion case considerable amount random statistical splay due simply fact pseudogenes good deal shorter normal genes giving rise noise signal case average length pseudogene bases vs normal genes even considerable noise though apparent dot clusters tend center different parts graph corresponding expected locations normal genes contrast situation leprae pseudogenes riddled frameshifts rendering concept codon base position moot refer second paintball graph page thus say confidence frameshifts rampant pertussis pseudogenes rendered concept codons irrelevant fact compared leprae pseudogenes pertussis comparatively unaffected frameshifts tends support view australian researchers mentioned earlier pseudogenes pertussis enough time accumulate many mutations also hypothesized pertussis plenty time years fact accumulate mutations pseudogenes yet done evidence suggests anything bordetella repairs pseudogenes even faithfully regular genes point might relevant interject leprae like members mycobacteria lacks muts mutl mismatch repair system bordetella fact muts mutl mismatch repair system may explain relative paucity frameshift errors bordetella pseudogenes also implies rather queerly bordetella goes way repair pseudogenes interestingly pseudogenes ag purine base one content greater means probably still frame ag less meaning likely genes membrane associated proteins look normal genes ag greater putative membrane associated proteins ag less bottom line pseudogenes putative membrane associated proteins twice likely still frame could statistical fluke could also membrane proteins somehow spared preferentially comes leaving pseudogenes translatable put differently pseudogenes non membrane associated proteins less likely remain frame makes sense much bordetella pathogenicity ascribed proteins make cell surface antigens transport toxins outside world toxic surface proteins may fact nonsense partial nonsense proteins products pseudogenes
