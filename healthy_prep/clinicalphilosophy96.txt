sitting pub night friend invited me consider ever really know whether psychotherapists helped patients curious kind sentence really works convey allegedly valid point put 'know italics desire modesty reflection self serving confirmation bias therapists reflection easy tell post hoc narrative good outcomes result therapy poor ones result psychopathology life circumstances incline me agree told me patient shared priceless 'when i better psychiatrist tells me drugs working i worse says something i wrong i ca win yet question touches me two concerns first interventionism philosophy science second distrust psychoanalytical psychotherapists outcome research distrust often seems poorly reasoned yet may i suspect sometimes something way looking therapeutic efficacy outcome sustains idea really know whether helped someone one interactions consulting room actually really works best reasons become clear call 'interventions emotional relief patient works best thought 'outcome thought 'distinct existences distinct existences want describe either actually merely apparently relation one another becomes clear get going picture emotional therapeutics renders impact beyond anything could safely non arrogantly said known yes distinct causes effects something brought therapist intervention something felt patient effect intervention appeal maximal epistemic modesty 'we ca ever really know whether really helps 'we ca ever really know whether intervention works becomes evident would anyone think 'workings interventions good way characterise therapeutic encounter might ally nicely medical model drug work ally really experience patients psychotherapy actually situations something like characterisation seem apt occupational behavioural therapy depressed person obvious example 'do know i really feel better going getting work i really expect said help i find myself feeling lot better even however two things going i think need teasing apart one non psychotherapeutic boon recovery self sustaining meaning making work world engagement etc good old behavioural recovery nothing unity subject subject therapeutic relationship rather transmission guiding idea one existential emotional shift recovery trust cogent solicitude therapist implicit situation patient mind part patient allows hear saying recovery trust mind recovery ability show meaningful solicitude whole however especially psychotherapy proper medical model i mean model framed terms distinct existences intervention outcome hardly seems applicable better model would i suggest face painting someone wants get face painted go face painter would daft call face painting intervention effect person face paint cause effect two separate things cause painting face thing face painted imagine someone saying 'but ever really know face daubing causes face daubed ness client correct answer 'yes mate i kinda talk causing flagrantly hyperbolic 'but objected 'psychotherapy hardly sure art face painting 'it uncertainty difficulty gives thoughtful scepticism point well yes must generalise difficulty significant emotional change relative facial hue change idea emotional change happen happens way aptly modelled idea interventions leading certainly uncertainly outcomes might rather like going see dyspraxic face painter four five attempted daubings miss target one question one might daubing causes better constitutes daubed question immodest pretend knowledge seems me perfectly clear enough kind unsafe inference kind inference sort matter clear therapist patient therapy alive truly functioning therapy patient defended emotionally cut irritable stuck depressed anxious state i make various attempts 'get many backfire i go rush tears relinquishment flowing openness settles meaningful relief sadness allows feel anger envy guilt relinquishes suppression involution anger lifting depression moment cessation depression cause ongoing cessation week inferring one thing another thing either borrow analogy squires brilliant critique causal theories memory curtains indigo today cause indigo tomorrow nothing intervened meantime moment therapeutic action therapist patient know perfectly well therapy working none say outcome research invalid means find description therapist actions beneficial patient reactions manifest external relata ask consistent relations therapist perhaps even across therapists using model therapy example although i think much harder think sensibly would crazy go see therapist whose outcome data measured thus effectively chance level offered therapeutic relationships therapeutic moments frequent waking hour patients lives would also seems me crazy try use outcome research guide practice least extent inclined mode therapeutic action things patients already know therapeutic sometimes need take courage sometimes need get better challenging defences discerning extent patient identification defences sometimes fail compassion fail technique showing compassion whatever would fail ethically meet patients people sometimes human lot need better model therapy rather something like call conscience therapy help projections know often enough working working witnesses unsafely inferred two place relation participants midst unitary unfolding patient emotional restoration
