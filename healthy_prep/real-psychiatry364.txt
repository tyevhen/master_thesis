i felt compelled get continued wheel spinning subject really starting annoy me people wringing hands like either know angrily invoke model suggests solution really two common models invoked medicalization society sort conspiracy big pharma psychiatry invent diagnoses indications prescribing medications order big pharma make money recipients overprescribing seen hapless victims never stood chance face medicalization conspiracy juggernaut stop big pharma monolithic psychiatry steamroller solutions dilemma equally far fetched first lets say physicians affiliated big pharma way need report connections recent evidence posted slowing physician interest jobs temporary otherwise free country one make money survive physician compensation dropping workload goes roof reimbursement hassle psychiatry onerous psychiatrists least likely speciality group accept insurance many physicians would like nothing better work pharmaceutical company lack slowing certainly surprise me naive way transparency works probably thought physicians would ashamed appearance conflict interest talking appearance conflict interest prototype transparency congress whose members blatantly take money provide easy access industries regulate transparency slow congress would slow physicians often positions actually paid rendering service company evidence quid pro quo another solution isolate physicians trainees pharmaceutical company representatives promotional materials probably weakest research history world research shows pharmaceutical promotions advertising influences physicians prescribe drugs weaker research maintenance certification measures worth time effort pretty clear throwing pharmaceutical reps curb diminished overprescribing anything practically prescribed

sanford guide hiv aids therapy came every medicine surgery house officer many staff counted microscopic type pages definitive guidance prescribing antibiotic antiviral therapies question identifying pathogen determining patient could tolerate medication prescribing drug recommended possible antibiotics overprescribed real reasons overprescribing overprescribing literature extends back well years point solutions readily found literature generally comes particular class drugs progress area i recently reviewed rems strategy current opioid problem i think would work really comes two things neither diagnosis medicalization first health care systems currently set offer type test pill solution problems least claiming responsible cradle grave health giving gym membership discount goes window enter clinic minutes doctor case mental health care many conditions present primary care better treated psychotherapy medications primary care physicians trained psychotherapy trained motivational interviewing suggest successful many patients really insult problems facing primary care physicians see patients difficult refractory problems patients see specialist twice go back

overprescribing guess many problem overprescribing viewed informational deficit believed example teaching physicians chronic pain pharmacology opioids somehow reduce opioid overprescribing i see anyone come conclusion physicians taught pharmacology experience prescribing opioids approach seems naive me joint commission pain initiative year physicians need determine uncomfortable giving patient prescription whatever asking i heard wide variety reasons career nothing indications drug majority physician believing could something alleviate patient distress wish independent diagnosis indication drug time new variation theme physicians somehow capable overcoming effects chronically impoverished environment severe ongoing adversity either inability resistance change prescribing drug basically rationale people use addicted drugs alcohol hope use something block reality hours overprescribing change interesting consideration diagnosis irrelevant tacked afterwards prescription written real medical reason needs better standards determining constitutes overprescribing i recently corresponded lead author paper looking issue overuse health care services see reference authors conclude ample evidence overuse scope research limited due difficulties definition would apply issue overprescribing psychiatric medications studies frequently make headlines significant methodological problems study i recently posted used two different data sources conclude antidepressants overprescribed studies need prescription survey administrative data studies necessarily labor intensive expensive end i always come back informed consent model patient competent consent cases physician patient detailed conversation prescription including risks benefits would like go without usually lengthy conversations tough decisions based fact nobody wants take medications regularly see doctors purpose continuing medications personal experience consistent patients told me years change
