become surrogate end point political debate abortion state i practice minnesota department health mails report number abortions state number warnings legal requirements reporting abortions p report despite fact physicians psychiatrists perform abortions i bristle i get politically motivated report year i writing post examine whether objective research mental health effects abortion done examination precipitated post forum time story abortion negatively affect women mental health study whenever i see article like i think two things life experiences women told me years abortion fits i also try think i would study issue would constitute mental health large studies depend interviews anymore typically means checklist sort psychometric instrument typically cutoff scores comparisons cutoff scores research subjects control group correlations made come psychiatric diagnosis psychological construct determine mental health kind technology underlying assumption good measures mental health covers possibilities human consciousness covers lot ground generally subtle problems get covered gross measures study question based telephone interviews semiannually period years cohort women selected abortion first trimester abortion turned away access abortion giving birth turned away access abortion giving birth results section authors plot results interviews point subjects participated average year period women received abortion presented within weeks clinics gestational limit abortions women pregnancies weeks past gestational limit turned away turnaway group either gave birth abortion miscarried possible outcomes based outcomes identified turnaway birth turnaway birth groups first trimester group included study whether psychological outcomes differed woman abortion early late pregnancy test metrics likert scales depression anxiety ratings came brief symptom inventory bsi item rating scale various psychological symptoms grouped ratings different symptom constellations including anxiety depression subjects asked rate level distress due symptom severity score ranging extremely anxiety depression items subjects identified case anxiety depression aggregate score total possible score life satisfaction determined one item satisfaction life scale i satisfied life one item also included self esteem rated point scale extremely high life satisfaction self esteem using variables trends best illustrated graphics depressive cases versus time depressive symptoms versus time figure similar graphics anxiety self esteem life satisfaction general trend less anxiety depression slightly higher self esteem life satisfaction year course study i think analysis latter two elements limited single items point scale regression toward midpoint rating usual extensive statistical analysis i would see fairly limited data turnaway groups near limit group generally depressive anxiety symptoms cases lower self esteem life satisfaction first trimester abortion group statistical analysis consistent observations authors conclude findings add body evidence rejecting notion abortion increases women risk experiencing adverse psychological outcomes women abortion demonstrated positive outcomes initially compared women denied abortion secondary analysis show history previous mental health problems psychological trauma correlated adverse outcomes may worse outcomes denied abortion discuss importance individualized care recognizing response abortion case denial abortion one trend i see specific comments turnaway birth group fact seemed best outcome years terms depressive symptoms syndromes higher self esteem life satisfaction overall conclusion authors believe study shows necessity laws warning women adverse psychological consequences abortion denied abortion potentially detrimental discussion limitations study loss subjects time significant years discuss methods used limit bias due loss potentially subjects mental illnesses discuss alteration bsi point really screening instrument identified cases study would require additional screening actual diagnosis anxiety disorder depressive disorder i several thoughts i read study women generally come psychiatrists say depressed anxious result abortion denied abortion might different psychiatric clinics specialize women health issues often discuss issue initial diagnostic evaluation disclose details along sensitive issues relationship established psychiatrist context discussions thoughts images feeling states related abortion forms psychopathology example would intense guilt rumination self criticism abortion episode depression person gets depressed common experience scan past personal history stressful events past lead emotion daydreams fantasies child would like brief episodes depression anxiety related self criticism doubt shame interpersonal conflict abortion many thoughts occur future date history abortion take new meaning new committed relationship life event impacts person conscious state causes distress significant me whether picked rating scales i would see reactions part normal emotional life rather anything pathological equating mental health women dsm diagnosis psychometric construct mistake dsm product looking people outliers trying characterize problems categories continua approach removes human consciousness equation longer acceptable psychiatry anyone interested conscious life real people event much potential meaning abortion never adequately characterized psychiatric diagnosis psychometric scale reactions diverse nuanced suggesting abortions lack abortions affect women political statement statement takes account important aspect human psyche unique conscious state every person conscious state unique happens course lifetime matters events matter others conclusion practice abortion one many events potential significantly impact conscious state woman consideration case contraception pregnancy prevention abortion whether causes mental illness symptoms woman unique conscious state also considered case unplanned pregnancies decision much complex list social variables whether contraception used appropriate focus conscious state rather mental illness symptoms would yield realistic idea effect life events like abortion result anything simple simplistic political solutions response solutions apply i secondary conclusion place politics research clinical care women place obvious annual vaguely threatening letter abortion reporting psychiatrist state government politicians practice medicine nothing good
