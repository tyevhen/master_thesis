many retirement parties go spend lot time talking violence i suppose might happen law enforcement military i went psychiatry i never seriously thought fact i might go work every day face people serious problems aggression violence cases would mean seeing people threatened kill me family would also mean seeing people documented incidents aggression toward others toward toward property i went retirement party yesterday nurse i worked acute inpatient setting years like nursing staff i work excellent skills also renown sense humor positive attitude kind person i counted things particularly grim frequent occurrence inpatients units i could make last hours party i missed evening shift leave go work people including psychiatric colleague worked me unit i known years i always consider retirement parties happy events i known many medical professionals never made retirement i want everybody make goal especially people i trenches i previously posted many times inpatient environment importance treating containing aggression function subverted political administrative forces rationed point minimally effective working inpatient psych unit lot like going war every day facing many patients want despite significant problems many involved contested commitment hearings based whether suicide aggression risk many severe substance use problems intensify suicidal thinking aggression generally interested treatment substance use problems see significant issue minimal resources work team social workers generally last long community resources want cooperate discharge plans acute care psychiatric units everyone working administration focused restricting resources providing suboptimal care everybody party worked me environment one point another years times like foxholes siege weeks time looking break good see everyone much less stressful context like groups people immersed high intensity work experience conversation tends gravitate back humorous stressful events part one common threads aggression i learned one nurses recently assaulted sustained broken nose traumatic brain injury discussed incident reactions psychiatric colleague added personal experiences aggression directed toward i looked around room i aware fact significant physical aggression occurred toward people cases episodes repeated physical aggression point career i realized really nobody interested helping inpatient staff contain aggression always administrators around ready assign blame i remember one particularly unhelpful consultation suggested problem lack rapidly forced medications recent administrative initiatives forcing anything suddenly everyone supposed respond quiet deescalation sitting quiet office somewhere looking spreadsheets lead insights containing aggression inpatient unit i guess typical administrator realize realization team discuss issues patients constantly emphasize violence risk emphasize want anyone take chances situations discuss detailed plan included ways approach patient family much medication halfway party one nurses handed me iphone story psychiatrist shot patient crisis clinic reminded me time i consider whether arm myself i tree hugger child god last thing i wanted guns house i aware psychiatrists killed patients several cases firearms i read article psychiatrist also sheriff deputy carried handgun case patient threatened shoot me i walking car clinic made additional threat burn house kill family proved knew find me reciting home address going work conditions every day treating aggressive patients stressful say least expected psychiatric staff cases even assaulted patient initiated assault still treatment i personal knowledge shooting incident descriptions suggest common system wide issues never well addressed days rather speculate media reports common safeguards i learned apply everywhere serve contain violence aggression clinics inpatient units atmosphere ca really expect reduce potential violence aggression unless environment adequately managed psychiatrists used talk milieu ship apparently sailed largest professional organization psychiatrists silent inpatient treatment treatment aggression violence american psychiatric association apa used guidelines matters nothing written long time i know giving widespread managed care blight open acknowledgement hopeless situation apa reduced homilies increasing access may reduce violent events rather speciality units set treat aggression violence associated severe psychiatric disorders inpatient units literally staff one side plexiglass violent aggressive patients i worked unit like one point shocked one day learn really behind plexiglass steel chair came flying shattering tempered glass window sailed right head i standing time must take quite bit force throw steel chair distance glass height nursing staff dove cover explosion glass addition staff took two sheriff deputies resolve situation number reasons given running units like none good puts patients staff risk eliminating one important aspects psychiatric care interpersonal relationship patients staff without correctional atmosphere develop conducive rioting treating mental illness floor history firearm related events case patient firearm smuggled held psychiatric resident hostage ended shooting sheriff deputy control desk hallway i worked i surprised one morning find number men unit suits i learned federal agents i surprised find carrying machine guns people armed automatic weapons really detract therapeutic atmosphere psychiatric unit relationships one dangerous situations i ever ending wrong side plexiglass wrong time wrong time time i blamed staffing problem i really nothing many people know attitudes staff toward one another played intensified version patients i found myself surrounded young aggressive paranoid antisocial patients threatened beat me i talked way situation solution time transfer unit idea i would let happen hopefully pass knowledge along staff unfortunately pattern behavior occur activated someone outside treatment team happens impossible deal constructive manner systems issues lack administrative support functional approach aggression often biggest obstacle solving problem issue many places approach kick road many community hospitals accept violent aggressive patients even patients highly suicidal may require staffing transferred tertiary care centers problems tend concentrate tertiary care centers important segregate patients based potential aggression i heard kinds arguments procedure hold water i think people may confused segregation issue i talking separating men high potential physical aggression inpatients generally vulnerable average person trying treat populations unit recipe disaster aggressive mentally ill people state concentrated hospitals safe way proceed treatment even needs considerable expertise part staff involved serious administrative deficiencies i never seen clinician knowledge required address issues administrative position new twist hospitals administrators experience charged running hospitals patients severe forms mental illness associated aggression commonest excuse addressing concerns list finances enough money provide adequate staffing many cases elaborate methods decide adequate staffing times staffing differences male unit housing patients psychotic personality disorders aggressive behavior much different mood disorders unit practically aggressive behavior security units high potential aggression often depends staff available cell phone alarm cases call local law enforcement i ask call made entire male unit essentially rioted longer safe staff nurses key lesson nobody ever learned medical school physicians seem learn reason anybody needs hospital nursing care doctors go minute blocks write orders procedures write prescriptions anywhere nurses patients follows one primary tasks physician assist nurses ranges taking care medical psychiatric problems timely manner backing highly contentious situations nurses make physicians miserable nurses incredibly hard job know takes team effort ca personality conflicts interest team need set aside
