beginning year interesting french study published changes brain activity diet induced obesity get excited used pigs humans specifically mini pigs sound awesome short put two sets pigs either standard pig crap lab diet controlled calories keep lean crap lab diet extra carb extra fat ad libitum months spect scans pigs brains also separate paper able determined obese pigs insulin resistance first though let start human data take tour parts brain let introduce prefrontal cortex okay tom naughton head bangs desk i guessing whacking prefrontal cortex going call pfc area hangs eyes fortunately habit seemed harm brain function recent terrific articles measure prefrontal cortex developed extensive humans primate responsible called executive function pfc helps predict outcomes prioritize modulate emotions socially acceptable norms helps sort best options given conflicting data reasoning basically bit like policeman brain sure would super fun get drunk skunk throw beer bottles roof neighbors policeman says er might get trouble drinking alcohol fact disinhibits pfc enables ask girl would approached sober course making selection impaired reasoning girl ask might look quite good sober back obesity brains play major role whether gain fat part happens obese humans prefrontal cortex seems less active lean humans finding especially interesting obesity pfc sends nerve fibers core appetite regulation part brain central orexigenic network presumably fully active policeman shaking night stick want go fridge second helping ice cream nuh uh enough policeman offline may easier consume extra helpings i sure i like policeman analogy much close lack willpower gluttony sloth fit model weird modern food poisoning brains reasoning piece appetite regulation machinery shot question obviously obese humans start underactive pfcs acquired along obesity well women obese underactive pfcs regained frontal lobe function successful weight loss evidence would suggest underactive pfcs hard wired depend upon environment including nutrition however study going opposite direction starting lean humans making obese controlled overfeeding extended period tough sell institutional review board days easier use mini pigs also seem particularly well developed pfcs let look experiment pigs kept lean made obese one spect scans one obese pigs unusable data lean obese standard diet composed barley wheat bran soy shell wheat sunflower meal soy meal minor components fat provided total nutritional value well much pig evolutionary history set loose warehouse cardiologist favorite power bar ingredients perhaps minipigs would eat days stay nice lean metabolic syndrome free experiment pigs fed calories per kilogram morning pigs dutifully ate swill one meal piggy things stayed lean since calories calories though i get back standard diet later obese diet eight animals fed western diet wd enriched carbohydrates lipids offered ad libitum months one ration offered hours calculated exceed daily calorie consumption animals wd composed wheat soy meal wheat bran barley sunflower oil cornstarch saccharose minor components fat provided total nutritional value gak enough said i wonder high oleic sunflower oil anyway results experiment well one interesting thing dietary pattern fattening pigs changed control pigs ate food morning western diet pigs became obese would eat meals day spontaneously fast day several days end months lean pigs weighed kg average started obese pigs weighed kg pretty impressive five months day final brain imaging lean pigs ate calories obese pigs ate calories expected brains obese pigs indeed decreased activity pfc dorsolateral prefrontal areas anterior prefrontal cortex addition lessening activity brain areas associated reward system specifically nucleus accumbens ventral tegmentum nucleus pontis consistent addiction literature people addicted something less activation reward areas brain response addictive stimulus people addicted thus addicted people need stimulus feel reward key finding decreased activation pfc correlated significantly final weight pigs obese became depressed pfc function tended learned mini pigs sunflower oil wheat bran cornstarch sacchralose quick recipe obesity pigs similar diet minus much cornstarch oil stay weight long feed controlled calories something weakness study trying prove sunflower oil starch make fat would interesting see happened groups fed ad libitum likelihood given corresponding human data reverse trial observationally pfc indeed play important role feeding signals hunger satiety states i quote researchers whether alteration brain dopamine system prefrontal cortex metabolism cause consequence obesity still unknown answer brought study less activation prefrontal cortex definitely acquired anomaly related obesity hard wired feature i framed sentence way mini pig paper using regained frontal lobe function however original paper womens frontal lobe function measured prior weight loss also possible women successfully lost weight subset better frontal lobe function study obese women decreased pfc metabolism lean formerly obese women pfc metabolism indistinguishable also dopamine frontal lobe obesity discussion post last year adhd obesity
