i quite excited i heard paper biological psychiatry days ago hyped way forgo usual dsm approach others make addiction assessment based neuroscience addiction basic dimensions assessment highlighted diagram authors make compelling argument terms needed addition clinical criteria provided reliable foundation practice addiction medicine clinical criteria referring dsm criteria basically problems symptoms used classify disorders non addictive use substances even biologically based symptoms craving tolerance withdrawal vary widely across individuals diagnostic group variation likely due biological complexity authors contend way examine heterogeneity among larger clinical divisions get pathophysiologically based subtypes suggest focus process outcomes use cancer example importance specific etiology diagnosis treatment disease case diagnosis treatment breast cancer brca gene used predict increased risk breast cancer subpopulation women diagnosis detection protein overexpression predict response monoclonal antibody trastuzumab interferes neu receptor information used within existing clinical context even addition information breast cancer would probably useful review several

would argue medical testing rule causes single important biomedical approach extensive test battery would add much summary several questions ana first whether ever widely implemented current form total length test minutes paper three tests based neuroimaging authors estimate would take hours complete cost anywhere per individual alone restricts ana urban areas psychiatric clinics well staffed
