days ago i gave detailed front back tutorial bit bio hacking i showed quickly get amino acid sequences versions hsp dnaj heat shock protein produced different organisms create graph arginine content versus lysine content organisms bacterial archaea resulting graph looked something like lysine arginine mole fraction dnaj protein microorganisms particular graph points i went back uniprot added organisms mix see trend line would hold true correlation actually got stronger r graph clearly shows lysine concentration goes arginine concentration goes graph prove lysine take place arginine dnaj exactly graph says although worthwhile hypothesis check want look aa sequence alignments see arginine lysine fact replacing exact spots protein across organisms certainly would reasonable lysine replace arginine polar positively charged amino acids i point organisms graph vary greatly genomic content codon aaa represents lysine experience taught me maybe noticed biogeek lysine usage pretty reliable proxy low content check codon usage tables organisms low gc genomes see use lysine amino acid clostridium botulinum aaa accounts codon usage buchnera low means high lysine usage likewise organisms low quite often disproportionately low frequency cpg dinucleotides dna much lower would occur chance technical explanation interesting i leave another day suffice say organisms low cpg tend definition use many codons begin cg code guess amino acid arginine see arg lys inverse relationship holds higher organisms i gathered dnaj sequences plants results idea time using data plants instead bacteria negative relationship however note one thing scale graph axes match scale axes previous graph graph seeing narrow range frequencies arg lys fortunately zunzun interface makes easy plot plant data using axis scaling bacterial data constraining axis limits visualize data apples apples context plant data plotted axis scaling used bacterial plot compare graph carefully first graph top page see points lie pretty much line fun i went back unitprot site searched dnaj insects arthropoda technically also subsumes crustacea i plotted bug data using axis scaling bacteria graph time insect dnaj sequences insect points tend cluster higher graph much left plants indicating arthropods seem like arg much care use lys moral i suppose diet lacking arginine eat fewer plants insects
