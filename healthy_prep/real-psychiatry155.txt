assessment potential suicide large part psychiatrist work within past decade footnotes popped even algorithms designed guide decisions psychopharmacology always present treatment guidelines major psychiatric disorders major cause anxiety practitioners know predictive capacity low importantly know unlike internists surgeons limited access resources necessary address problem considering moment typical outpatient crisis person known practice depression clinically changed office assessment suicidal thoughts options limited case assessment extreme risk inpatient treatment may offered patient inpatient experience knows inpatient units generally miserable places little active care happens enclosed number ill patients may also know arbitrary number hoops must jumped order discharged result

familiarity case reasons also people averse sitting hospitals people balk suggestion inpatient care suggestion inpatient care also assumes availability option community hospitals given state offer inpatient psychiatric care level care discriminated political financial level years result hospital services inpatient psychiatric beds contracted expected manner patients often transferred hundreds miles within states reach beds related issue availability electroconvulsive therapy severe depressions case high risk depression may effective option many states availability option patients need suggestion emergency department ed care even bigger dead end vast majority ed care provided mental health professionals psychiatrists making triage decisions ed physicians sign wait hours high risk determination made might days ed disposition made patients often discharged basis whether suicidal ideation chronic whether saying suicidal thought intent harm right time assessment factors generally place burden care back original treating psychiatrist even risk higher would want psychiatrists recognize treating ill patients needs element acceptable risk order provide treatment hope recovery psychiatrists realize resources severely rationed patient needs acute treatment patient accept certain treatment societal expectation medical paternalism patient able remain safe psychiatrist patient frequently operating zone acceptable risk perceived differently others family members clearest case point like society general many family members biases comes psychiatry many instrumental discouraging family member getting treatment cases interfered treatment suggested family member discontinue treatment throw away medications taking time family members generally favor zero risk treatment environment would prefer patient suicidal thinking resolve completely risk attempt suicide see suicidal thoughts controllable product series correctable decisions understand thoughts ca turned patient psychiatrist cases medication patient taking extreme cases may threaten litigation patient suicides makes suicide attempt implying volitional controllable basis suicidal thinking understanding human consciousness provides way analyze situation misperceptions suicidal thinking behavior predominant model risk assessment suicidal ideation aggressive potential risk factor analysis generally proceeds elaboration specific thoughts past history attempts availability lethal means diagnostic risk factors past history analysis attempts specific demographic risk factors associated suicide attempts many texts like harvard medical school guide suicide assessment intervention detailed approaches problem conceptualizations like proximate distal risk factors earlier post i discovered checklist risk factors looked issue increased reasons decreased barriers suicide called convergent functional information suicide scale cfi many institutions days prefer columbia suicide severity rating scale ssrs methods essentially based risk factor analysis elaborate others estimate risk one degree another cases factors mitigate risk i wo debate merits methods i want say risk estimated psychiatrist may still working high risk patient unpredictable inpatient outpatient setting interventions initiated reduce risk assurance effective fast enough prevent suicide attempt many clinics standardized approach like used electronic health record cutoff score used determine risk psychiatrist may find patient visits flagged months longer based numbers another model might supplement improve upon risk factor analysis models years i looking model considers basic question happens human conscious state shifts one would never contemplate suicide one extreme state proceeds rapidly suicide usual psychiatric model considers development illness state like depression bipolar disorder borderline personality disorder alcoholism precursor state cognitive changes like depressogenic thinking seen precursor states seen basis suicidal thinking intervention generally directed reversing precursor state acutely structuring environment necessary safety direct verbal interventions address suicidal thinking possible explore people transition conscious state person without suicidal thinking person develops suicidal thinking consider broad array associated factors able recognize transition occurred important part evaluation intervention people severely depressed seems like suicidal thinking forever barely recognize time felt better suicidal many cases

tendency anxiety depression directly relevant considerations examining going one conscious level individual become suicidal elementary risk factor analysis also benefits broader perspective considering conscious factors allows exploration additional degrees freedom example issue firearms possession elaboration risk often depends possession risky behavior gun constitutes risky behavior needs asked gun hand thinking suicide gun loaded actually point loaded gun thinking time questions responses anticipated linear risk factor analysis algorithm nonlinear consciousness approach also incorporate informed consent approach provide active feedback patient current risk limitations treatment often opens window dynamics patient conceptualizes risk ability work psychiatrist minimizing linear assessment often takes structure psychiatrist trying guess whether patient going kill leaves patient relatively passive participant consciousness based approach recognizes patient entered least partially conscious state foreign less predictable represents degree risk need hear clearly psychiatrist need work together restore baseline conscious state reduce risk meantime process encourages
