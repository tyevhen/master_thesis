jama psychiatry jun article caught eye jama psychiatry stimulant methamphetamine cocaine prescription stimulants various synthetics use disorders previously called addictions difficult problems treat especially true epidemic adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnoses cross contamination cognitive enhancement movement well new indications stimulant prescriptions stimulant medications widely available generally work level people take leading common impression i took cousin adderall worked therefore i must adhd need adderall prescription time happened usually difficult physician explain patient positive response stimulant equate adhd diagnosis especially prospective patient functioning high level presenting diagnosis treatment extremely well college first years professional school second problem adhd stimulant use issue misconception people true adhd less susceptible positive reinforcing effects stimulants people without adhd certainly subgroups person diagnosis like take stimulants find stimulants decrease appetite given increased anxiety insomnia many cases leave feeling restricted affectively blunted less spontaneous i find patients generally selected time adults true adhd diagnoses middle school like stimulants many cases parents like effect seeing taken may developed significant coping strategies based dislike stimulant effects like many adult psychiatric disorders one uniform phenotype phenotype person diagnosed either child adult gets euphorigenic effect stimulants escalates dose clearly exists seen treatment centers many cases iatrogenic diagnosis bipolar disorder pattern taking month prescription stimulant first one two weeks either going withdrawal using depressant like alcohol benzodiazepines opioids treat dysphoria cravings associated stimulant withdrawal also situation person using high dose prescribed stimulants taking prescribed using high doses meth cocaine street develop residual state identical adhd cause adhd stimulant i think error treat residual state stimulants residual state generally associated profound level impairment lack insight patient aware significant cognitive problems attributes adhd often insists treatment stimulants despite clear addiction stimulants may insist years decades stimulant use attempt self diagnose treat adhd common patients substance abuse problems give history formal diagnosis childhood school occupational impairment offer opinion think may adhd considerations lead associated problems providing care people clear adhd stimulant use diagnoses leads me multisite study effects high doses extended release mixed amphetamine er salts adhd cocaine use patients diagnoses doses used mg day commonly used current prescription versions drugs typically recommend maximum dose adults mg day interestingly titrate tolerability statement package insert drug mg day used trials statement adequate evidence doses greater mg day conferred additional benefit authors describe dosing selections robust suggest evidence higher doses needed treat cocaine use problems looking authors methodology screening trial instructive problems encountered clinical practice total patients screened ultimately randomized placebo mg day er mg day er five hundred sixty two screened due medical psychiatric exclusion criteria common older populations stimulant users find significant cardiovascular morbidity form cardiomyopathy coronary artery disease arrhythmias exclusion criteria aspect study i really liked would suggest implemented everyday practice authors approach blood pressure heart rate specifically participants blood pressure higher mm hg heart rate higher beats min weeks single readings blood pressure higher mmhg heart rate higher beats min discontinued study medication always shocking hear person stimulants years nobody ever checked blood pressure pulse especially sitting front hypertensive tachycardic basic procedure done person taking stimulants antipsychotics antidepressant matter cns active drug similar effects noted medications discontinued another important aspect study although patients well screened complex substance use standpoint current alcohol cannabis nicotine use disorders high levels nicotine use surprising considering epidemiological correlations smoking cocaine use recent evidence epigenetic effects nicotine substance use disorders authors comment whether different outcomes non smokers study primary outcome measure adhd reduction aisrs adult adhd investigator symptom rating scale high strength group low strength group achieved outcomes odds ratios respectively see text confidence intervals terms cocaine use outcomes mg dose resulted fewer cocaine positive weeks positive toxicology report abstinence last three weeks numbers given table high dose er resulted significant reduction cocaine positive weeks weeks study mg doses actually fairly equivalent form statistical standpoint superior placebo terms adhd cocaine outcomes real question whether reasonable clinical approach problem intent treat analysis significant drop rates drop rates illustrated rapid decline denominators group table experience substantial number patients adhd either cocaine amphetamine use disorder reach end prescribing algorithm failed relapsed many cases failure lead prescription stopped many reasons lack information prescribing physician foremost among real world clinic follow patients three times week toxicology screens visits offer cognitive behavioral therapy models currently funded managed care companies governments consist patients seen every one three months minutes many visits done clinicians little addiction experience within medication maintenance literature particularly buprenorphine maintenance studies suggest psychotherapy adds nothing outcomes even without data business manager would consider therapists cost effective beyond stimulant prescription key element i never see studies patient subjective response stimulant increasing doses i found koob definition addiction generally predictive addiction chronic relapsing syndrome moves impulse control disorder involving positive reinforcement compulsive disorder involving negative reinforcement euphorigenic hypomanic effect usually high risk positive reinforcer regardless substance taken one theories abuse deterrent approaches pharmacokinetics substance used prevents rapid availability brain decreases abuse potential many abuse deterrent preparations fail multiples dose taken result positive reinforcing aspects addiction cycle i consider authors paper elegant experimental approach graphic top page first rate source information also illustrates problem coming clinical trial translated practice i would consider implementing strategy clinical approach long term study looked thoroughly outcomes time i think modest results short term study warrant widespread practice using extended release mixed amphetamine salts cocaine use disorders also legal issues prescribing maintenance doses controlled substances order maintain addiction laws currently written i would liked see attempt characterize subjective responses methamphetamine use measured along analysis whether non smokers better smokers george dawson md dfapa references drug facts comparisons wolters kluwer health st louis mo levin fr
