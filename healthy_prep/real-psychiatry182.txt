professional life i done original notes way usually kind form anywhere pages long i list things majority interview i flip blank side write free hand i write fast handwriting bad cursive crude combination capitals lowercase symbols i know meaning point back i studying medical decision making reading experts move chunks data i started draw chunks data paper circles squares timelines triangles various connectors show relationships rhythm depending fast person i interviewing talking much information discussed i much time person mostly silent i person rambling including far many details write much feel pen hand moves paper extremely important i use pilot pens i alternate mm tips black red blue red blue highlighting editing gel ink perfect feel hand gliding across page messy end busy day hands smeared ink writing next step dictation i translate non linear scratchings linear coherent report formulation various diagnoses recommendations treatment plan diagram top post example one collection words symbols corner one page notes took me seconds draw pieces i heard various elements described hr middle circle heart rate arrows direction mean increasing direction decreasing i like see elevated heart rates i seen many middle aged stimulant users cardiomyopathy many conversations cardiologists whether sinus tachycardia benign finding i obsessed far long i treat medications based heart rate greater beats per minute bpm i reassured latest review uptodate idiopathic sinus tachycardia benign outcomes i doubt people studies people i seeing stimulants antidepressants antipsychotics street drugs alcohol caffeine plenty tobacco middle trying construct impossible timeline insomnia anxiety depression childhood adversity adult psychological trauma multiple medical problems i drawn temporarily little heart rate circle i trying figure starts thc proceeds clockwise i impressed number daily cannabis smokers point notice getting anxious panicky despite hype pro marijuana contingent people relate augmented heart rate increased intensity heart beats smoking marijuana happens thc drops blood pressure heart acts reflexively typically ignored young smokers unless panic attack case feels like starting panic attack start feel uneasy many cases start develop panic attacks every time smoke often leads discontinuing use cannabis since panic attacks unpleasant experiences thc lead increased heart rate caffeine ubiquitous american society affects many dimensions psychiatry asked answers often shocking availability espresso places i often

energy drink i usually track mg caffeine using online resource dsm suggests caffeine consumption well excess mg problem i find myself routinely advising people get caffeine consumption less mg day use mornings starting point cases i told people drinking beverages combine alcohol caffeine questionable compounds pharmacokinetics caffeine important people know happens get wired precipitate panic attack triple shot espresso know happen sleep steady state levels caffeine exercise important source accelerated heart rate cases rushing get vital signs done important causes deconditioned folks decide going turn completely new leaf starting exercise vigorously i may seeing day exercise session still elevated heart rate conditioned folks still overdo led me ask people wearing heart rate monitor goals responses shocking i many people tell me running heart rate well beyond age determined maximal heart rate long time i never person tell me might good idea opportunity educate people overdo either maintain conditioning start basic conditioning also leads me consider people may undiagnosed intrinsic heart disease evaluations need done medications important direct indirect cause tachycardia group older medications like tricyclic antidepressants anticholinergics reliable causes current day medications stimulants probably important cause increased heart rate general stimulants increase heart rate beats per minute bpm increase blood pressure points recent generation medications rarer causes always important look one person hundred thousand really idiosyncratic reaction sign something worse like neuroleptic malignant syndrome serotonin syndrome current line work withdrawal medications important cause tachycardia direct effect medication coming benzodiazepines barbiturates clonidine important causes tachycardia various rare cardiovascular effects still listed package inserts important reason monitoring vital signs electrocardiograms lot people seem think anxiety potent cause tachycardia may true panic attacks ongoing basis i found anger much likely elevate pulse blood pressure i seen persistent tachycardia bpm range due anger i seen patients started antihypertensives i think good idea long plan decrease stop medication anger resolves i always tell patients explanation white coat life stressors much caffeine etc gets far still running high pulse blood pressure home probably treated closely followed i personally like see people running systolic blood pressures excess diastolics greater pulses greater wait lifestyle changes take effect i know fact primary care physicians disagree me anxiety especially persistently panicky person elevated pulses many folks look thin hypermetabolic routinely checked hyperthyroidism always negative i listened nasa physician lecture subgroup patients body habitus many years ago said thin people arachnodactyly bothered anxiety panic best treatment moderate levels exercise like walking rather medication defined condition anyone grasp wrist thumb middle finger notice overlap least distal joint middle finger epidemiological studies show people sleep deprived circadian rhythm disrupted poorer cardiovascular health many people develop tachycardia setting sleep disordered breathing disorders also important cause tachycardia daytime folks often associated problem like undiagnosed atrial fibrillation many commercial automatic blood pressure machines detect irregular pulses important check pulses pulse deficits office psychiatrists access lab facilities electrocardiograms run referral facilities necessary testing management identified conditions flows little inch drawing one intake notes i would thought enterprising software developer would come system icons i could point grow computer tablet far seems electronic health record developers really designing software physicians mind would rather enter full text commonly choppy phrase based notes using icon based full information approaches little hr circle contains lot information way i seen information content estimated constructing possible text based narratives measuring amount text method limitations i physician makes drawing connected unique conscious state certainly overlap physicians extent least ones hr icon notes overlap gets closer among looking arachnodactyly george dawson md dlfapa
