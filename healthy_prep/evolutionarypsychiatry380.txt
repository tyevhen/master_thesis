quick review basic premise new lens i examine nutrition general health mental health humans beings best chance good physical mental health staying true diet activities evolved let get back diet moment focus differences eat today physically healthy peoples cultures ate much following information taken food western disease never leave home without know several hundred years good observation anthropology healthy peoples ate wide variety different foods vastly differing percentages macronutrients primarily differences carbohydrates fats protein usually around calories types quality food ate however universally differed current diet following ways wheat grain based grains carefully prepared minimize antinutrients minimal amounts omega fatty acids balanced omega fatty acids vast amounts omega reliance whole foods industrial processing therefore highly refined carbohydrates sugar perhaps seasonal raw honey wild fruits opinion one need understand science biochemistry differences go forward paleolithic style diet based time tested diets healthy cultures however i interested differences might cause western disease i going focus moment introduce fading star heart healthy diet vegetable oils fading star recent article trumpets vegetable oil second coming though always stephan whole health source reasoned review corn oil safflower oil sunflower oil peanut oil soybean oil ingredients pretty much processed food check list back breakfast cereal bread baked goods also fried items salad dressings mayonnaise sauces used along canola oil fryers restaurants cheap relatively tasteless makes perfect certain industrial restaurant food applications also universally high omega fatty acids therefore eat ton western diet especially since throwing butter lard beef tallow years ago could possibly matter omega fatty acids type pufa polyunsaturated fatty acid required body make certain hormones signaling molecules omega pufas essential fatty acids ca make signaling molecules without need live pufas made hufas highly unsaturated fatty acids vital discussion i like say 'hufa omega pufas particular linoleic acid made hufa arachidonic acid arachidonic acid aa precursor sorts inflammatory signaling molecules including example cox cox blocked ibuprofen nsaids decrease pain inflammation understandable review eicosanoids much inflammation mediated high dietary percentage omega fatty acid linoleic acid predominant fatty acid corn oil reasonably associated coronary vascular disease insulin resistance cancer hypothyroidism autoimmune diseases thrombotic stroke headaches asthma arthritis melanoma depression psychosis i keep harping balance omega pufas well turns omega wild fish oil best source also available grass fed animal fat kinds seafood flax balanced levels omega walnuts macadamia nuts compete body omega every way omega precursors anti inflammatory signal molecules obviously counteract inflammatory signal molecules store much either eat omega displace omega systems supplementing omega fatty acids shown beneficial number major diseases need survive max omega without omega end highly inflammatory soup chemicals stored floating around bodies predisposing list cancer diabetes obesity depression heart disease autoimmune diseases numbers food western disease ratios omega omega fatty acids different populations page omega omega ratio coastal fishing populations hunter gatherers greece japan today northern europe today usa today real kicker modern diet first load vegetable oils create large reservoir pro inflammatory molecules add soup thought highly allergenic pro inflammatory proteins gluten gliadin beta casein proteins peanuts similar proteins genetically modified soy etc etc modern diseases almost always linked back inflammation kind mind combination explains schedule full every day eat less omega omega one way eat paleo get rid processed food use olive oil vinegar instead supermarket salad dressing balance nuts relatively high omega fish oil wild caught fish poultry fat relatively higher omega eat grass fed beef wild caught fish nice balance chicken turkey i really part ways grand poohbahs nutritional recommendations eat saturated fat really wo kill instead baking industrial seed oils use butter coconut oil neutral players omega omega fat war plenty healthy cultures eat reasonable even high amount saturated fat masai kitavans tokelau drop dead heart attacks age pastured butter bone marrow yummy traditional treats high saturated fats also best sources vitamins need get modern diet later see happened nutritional recommendations years first told eat saturated fat foods high cholesterol figured almost immediately foods high cholesterol eggs cause heart disease even elevated cholesterol humans deemed confusing message changed eat saturated fat first everyone moved pufas vegetable oils including deadly trans fat margarine discovered pufas cause cancer trans fats horrible message switched 'eat low fat fairly restricted amount protein eat anyway low fat diet therefore high carbohydrates particularly vicious mix sugar wheat everyone following advice got really fat diabetes incidence exploded backpedaling message changed healthy fats omega olive oil whole grains eaten without careful preparation eat may contribute problem mediterranean diet though true mediterranean diet plenty saturated fat cheese butter france synonymous consider disease states i looking require two hits diet make happen example wheat lectins open gut casein protein blood predispose beta cells autoimmune destruction type one diabetes one see nutritional recommendations backflip catch science everyone confused sick fat unhappy one need stress food make food enemy one go basic default paleo style diet add modern foods dairy based observations cultures like masai ate diseases modern civilization work already done pay attention
