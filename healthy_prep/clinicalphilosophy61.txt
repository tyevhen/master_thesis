aaron beck recounting history clinical disillusion psychoanalysis beck describes reactions two patients one women generously regaled stories sex life whose transference yet latently dominated worries boring i written story patient perhaps less well known gets told aaron beck cognitive therapy depression personal reflection aberdeen scottish cultural press seems me despite forming lynchpin beck turning away psychoanalysis really cries psychoanalytic treatment pre empt conclusion i shall argue beck really reacting clumsy form ego psychology cognitive therapy better bet theory practice ego psychological form psychoanalysis trained version psychoanalysis pays proper attention complexity unintegrated internal object relations better bet still whilst task psychotherapy integration aspects beck theorising mind work i know must seem like i trying give guy hard time really i suspect much better creative psychotherapist many analytic colleagues i value pragmatism approach i feel also psychotherapy disservice threw object relational baby ego psychological bathwater depressed male patient psychoanalysis according beck followed fundamental rule 'of reporting everything came mind

'contrary erstwhile understanding psychoanalytic dictum anger leads directly guilty feelings first i think confident beck believe anger led guilty feelings reason obvious someone feels guilty getting angry either realistically neurotically take unreasonable i think also confident psychoanalyst ever thought hostile feelings lead guilt feelings meaningful reason brute reflex michael mceachrane second takings given expression second stream thoughts beck describes need remember distinguish two senses 'thought one akin 'belief another 'occurrent cogitation someone says 'i think probably
