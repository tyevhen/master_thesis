i going tell horrifying also tedious frustrating true story trying get ambulance transport elderly man dementia detained mental health care home hospital fact hospital private hospital miles away care home immaterial ought happen person person assessed mental health follows particular routine arrangements patient assessed made includes notifying bed managers bed may required arranging two doctors least one must approved attend amhp assessment takes place hospital identified accept patient arrangements made patient conveyed hospital ambulance usually suitable mode transport patient conveyed hospital admitted chronic nationwide shortage psychiatric hospital beds area especially people dementia routinely meaning assessment process suspended step days even weeks bed found admission arranged common area particular private hospital used almost additional ward local dementia patients hospital often visits potential patient making final decision take several days patient fortunate enough considered suitable hospital requires admitted hrs day admission even bed identified patient formally detained mha encountering problems local ambulance trust patient care home receiving hospital requires admission hrs makes sense order ambulance advance previous day amhp hub first encountered problems job duty practice consultant see previous blog post explanation pc ring ambulance service order ambulance however i told clear terms ambulance service emergency service could booked advance could dispatch ambulance day using traffic light protocol agreed amhp service ambulance service briefly arrangement prioritises response times red light means patient seriously distressed situation critical need taken hospital soon possible ambulance try arrive within minutes amber light means patient less distressed ambulance endeavour arrive within two hours green light means patient settled safe place ambulance arrive within four hours requested generally system works well although even red light requests ambulances still diverted urgent calls cardiac arrests i complain i pointed green light request amhp service made request hrs start working day ambulance arrive hours would impossible ambulance get patient hospital admission deadline journey would take least two hours ambulance service swayed request within contracted provide end pc colleague duty following day ring ambulance service home around hrs order ensure ambulance would arrive time transport patient two hour journey hospital event ambulance arrived hrs dropped patient receiving hospital minutes admission deadline clearly untenable situation amhp hub manager spent several days negotiating relevant clinical commissioning group ccg actually make contracts ambulance trust sort situation could avoided future time i duty pc next week agreement reached ccg contracts manager gave instructions ring different number wishing arrange ambulance circumstances number patients booking line ambulances part local ambulance trust particular service allowed routine booking ambulances transport patients range situations happened another patient identical circumstances job arrange ambulance convey hospital hrs following day i rang number explained ccg contracts manager told requested ambulance next day call handler non plussed went consult several different people course call finally giving me one three reasons could would convey patient reason service contracted convey patients detained mental health reason hospital care home private meant patient nhs patient would case transport patient fact hospital paid mental health trust ccg hence nhs receive treat patient appeared make difference reason even though contract ccg explicitly covered town patient resided name ccg actually really cover area another county i rang ccg contracts manager explained difficulty i suggested i spoke contracts performance manager mental health trust i spoke officer admitted appeared gap contract told me leave somewhat surprise hour later i received phone call another call handler ambulance booking service took necessary details transport request including current medication regime fact prescribed lorazepam times day fact frail would need wheelchair transfer arranged patient would collected care home hrs following morning i even given booking reference number success last sanity prevailed ah hour later i received call patient ambulance booking manager discovered reason service contracted take sedated patients would therefore make request tomorrow morning left colleague next day make early morning phone call usual ambulance service number initially tried give reason could transport patient grounds hospital another county outside area covered however withdrawn pointed ambulance trust covered large geographical area explicitly included county question seem able come th reason eventually ambulance crew picked patient took hospital within required time scale significance wider scheme things sorry failure meet would appear straightforward request exemplifies far deeper problem nhs privatisation stealth happening gradually many years goes way back margaret thatcher government early brought nhs community care among things introduced concept purchaser provider split provision social care explicitly designed encourage use private services whereas home care provided house required least home care purchased private organisations mental health nhs trusts operating various guises many years opening way least theory trusts compete internal market provide services introduction clustering payment results made possible packages care treatment mental disorders sold private companies prepared offer specific services i discuss detail blog post health social care disposed primary care trusts replaced clinical commissioning groups supposedly led clinicians whose function purchase services nhs trusts indeed private companies prepared offer services companies virgin care stepped provide range health services relieving nhs billions pounds process apart private health care companies well established internal market within nhs ostensibly designed facilitate provision services practice necessarily happen example i given highlights problems artificial division budgets problems i encountered obtaining transport detained patient entirely due bizarre internal market local ambulance trust course part nhs range contracts clinical commissioning groups within area contracts necessarily provide blanket ambulance service written way specific services offered request fit wording contract service offered long established local ambulance trust convey patients area convey patients requiring restraint amhp service rely private ambulance services huge expense ccgs another local example would appear nonsensical interpretation contract local ambulance service convey patient detained place safety purpose assessment patient detained mha needs conveyed hospital transfer covered contract difficult understand system benefit patients might save nhs money
