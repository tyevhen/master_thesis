jing shall discuss view triple burner relation movement triple burner governing movement chapter nan jing mentions function triple burner governing body triple burner stems yuan governs body name form belongs hand shao yang external fu short passage summarizes aspects triple burner stems yuan discussed august clinical tip governs body shall see triple burner name form i actual organ function pertains shao yang gall bladder fu let explore meaning triple burner governing movement movement general called mechanism ji mechanism consists ascending descending entering exiting different places different organs organ particular direction flow spleen ascends stomach descends channel flows upward downward direction acupuncturists familiar ascending descending movement use movement every time insert distal local point treat particular problem along channel example use l i shangyang example l i jianyu treat pain area acromio clavicular articulation shoulder making use ascending descending movement along large intestine channel stimulating ascending descending movement channel removing obstruction therefore pain somewhat less familiar horizontal movement i entering exiting enters exits various structures organs example enters exits space skin muscles membranes joint capsules cavities moreover enters exits every part body among tai yang shao yang yang ming among tai yin jue yin shao

problem head stop brain problem chest stop front chest back shu points problem abdomen stop back shu points chong mai right left umbilicus moving dong problem lower legs stop st qichong called qijie bl chengshan notice recommends use points front back area chest use front chest back shu points abdomen back shu points chong mai points legs st front leg bl back leg suggests horizontal movement within area triple burner controls ascending descending entering exiting mechanism one words frequently used chinese books describe function triple burner tong means free passage pass penetrate describes function triple burner ensuring passes mechanism cavities organs whole process called transformation triple burner result transformation production nutritive ying defensive wei blood body fluids also triple burner said control kinds central scripture classic zhong zang jing han dynasty says triple burner three original body yang organ clear controls zang fu ying wei channels interior exterior left right triple burner free passage passes freely interior exterior left right triple burner irrigates body harmonizes interior exterior benefits left nourishes right conducts upwards descends downwards mentioned previous clinical tip chapter nan jing also confirms triple burner controls movement general triple burner makes yuan separate different functions controls movement passage upper middle lower burner zang fu upper middle lower burner apart referring generally types burner passage also refers specifically gathering zong upper nutritive ying middle defensive wei lower burner although defensive exerts influence primarily upper burner superficial layers body space skin muscles originates lower burner ming men chapter ling shu says ying originates middle burner wei originates lower burner chapter nan jing also confirms triple burner exerts influence types triple burner stems yuan supports chapter confirms influence triple burner movement parts body triple burner gathers avenues jie means triple burner responsible free passage channels also structures cavities body thus triple burner function governing movement quite similar liver free flow indeed many similarities regard movement useful compare contrast function triple burner liver ensuring free flow liver ensures free flow aids ascending descending organs especially stomach spleen intestines triple burner influence ascending descending entering exiting extends organs moreover triple burner controls entering exiting parts body especially body cavities liver function relation body cavities clinical application triple burner controls movement mechanism points may used similar way liver points ensure free flow main point i use move triple burner tb zhigou nanjing college traditional
