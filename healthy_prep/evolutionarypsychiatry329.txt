one questions came comments first post series researchers celebrities stuck gluten free casein free diets treat autism whole idea based idea exorphins dietary opiate proteins found gluten casein somehow cause exacerbate neurological issues autism spectrum disorders asds also well documented kids asds seem gut dietary issues kids dietary culprit obvious place look weakness theories eating gluten casein long time beta casein found cows european descent also cows make american australian new zealand milk least autism rates possibly escalating recently back jama released study editorial rates autism time studies showing rates somewhere around per children since previous studies usually estimated around per children means doubling prevalence early many issues trying put reliable number together i recommend read editorial i linked seems fair presentation data main issue definition autism spectrum disorders widened considerably could certainly explain increase prevalence studies without actual increase prevalence population number large survey studies done including parents national children health study another multi site study autism developmental disabilities monitoring addm network big news last year several studies came time rate jumped approximately per children i let second study speak point approximate range children males females average prevalence asds identified among children aged years increased sites addm surveillance year although improved ascertainment accounts prevalence increases documented addm sites true increase risk children develop asd symptoms ruled average although delays identification persisted asds diagnosed community professionals earlier ages increase four years sounds really really bad however much increase felt due increased awareness recognition early intervention treatment could help kids asds kids diagnosed earlier diagnosis would made readily kids could eligible early intervention services fact latest studies may ones actually realistic estimate number kids affected previous studies grossly underestimated number cases opinion best evidence autism may increasing report adult psychiatric morbidity study uk found approximately adults living households symptoms consistent asds since pretty close number today children suggests enormous increase diagnosis kids may due increased outreach widening diagnostic categories however recent increase ca entirely ruled event means necessarily look something brand spanking new rapidly changing society explain increase take broader view back gluten casein pesky exorphins couple interesting tidbits really theorized mechanism wheat casein exorphins causing neurotoxic events expressed brains develop quite similar theory schizophrenia probably coincidence schizophrenia autism affect population genetic chromosomal deletion syndromes implicated autism schizophrenia frankly exorphin question easy one test least indirectly naltrexone readily available relatively inexpensive opiate blocker pill form taken sit opiate receptors like lock door blocking exorphins casein gluten readily heroin morphine keep opiates activating opiate receptors dietary exorphins worsen autism vulnerable phenotypes naltrexone help fortunately several studies naltrexone autism overall studies lean towards naltrexone useful treatment kids seems effective decreasing self injurious behavior interesting light findings i wrote post linking alterations opiate symptoms self injurious behavior like self picking finger biting head banging also seems help kids improved attention eye contact hyperactivity agitation stereotyped behaviors social withdrawal temper tantrums naltrexone fda approved use autistic disorder kids due limitations therapeutic alternatives mentioned often review papers useful medicine might worth giving try mean dietary exorphins definitely cause problem least piece cause fast whole reason scientists studied naltrexone autism first place nothing wheat casein turns paper hypothesized link derangements opiate systems autistic children symptoms autism later naltrexone studies showed kids autism seem produce excess beta endorphin natural opiates theory goes like flooding immature brains kids beta endorphins may delay hamper maturation way causing brains autistic kids stay infantile stage development particularly regards social interaction sensory response kids responded best naltrexone biggest decreases amount beta endorphins right let bring together large subset autistic kids seem leaky guts remember robust link amount leakiness gut either positive celiac markers gastrointestinal symptoms diarrhea bloating abdominal pain ca tell kid leaky gut using kinds criteria tests another subset autistic kids elevated levels natural beta endorphins seem responsive opiate blocker naltrexone gluten casein exorphins opiates hypothetically wriggle leaky gut may effect central nervous system finally plausible link gluten casein autism necessarily cause certainly cure perhaps exacerbating factor april dietary studies crap small enter scanbrit randomised controlled single blind study gluten casein free dietary intervention children autism spectrum disorders published nutritional neuroscience april study combined lot nice features decent sample size danish kids asds established standard diagnostic criteria long two years sort modified cross design honest single blind meaning researchers except nutritionists know kids getting special diets parents course knew kids urine tested abnormal metabolic byproducts researchers first year put half kids gluten free casein free diet monitored progress months improvements kids diet significantly better kids diet would extend trial put everyone gf cf diet months monitor total months happened actual trial significant improvement study diet kids worsening kids standard diet everyone put study diet last months researches used battery different tests measuring bunch different subsets autistic behaviors adhd symptoms points along trial results introducing gluten free casein free diet significant beneficial group effect months intervention core autistic related behaviors improvement less dramatic first months could represent plateau effect attentional communication symptoms seemed improve half kids dropped second year perhaps kids benefit researchers note long term safety studies gluten free casein free diets kids knowledgeable nutritionist consulted whew one last little thing leaky gut study i wrote extensively first post diet autism interesting component i mention kids study turns already gluten free casein free diet leakiness gut measured via ipt test two sugars lactulose mannitol given orally fasting kids urine collected next five hours mannitol small absorbed via cells gut amount absorbed reflects absorptive capacity gut lactulose large absorbed directly cells squeeze cells lot squeeze gut leaky ratio lactulose mannitol excreted urine goes way normal ratio less higher number leaky gut control kids study ratio average autistic kids overall ratio average autistic kids gluten free casein free diet ratio less data autistic kids special diet used average ratio jumped approximately leakiness measured kids relation gi symptoms positive celiac marker testing take away point i think enough scientific evidence suggest kids asds fact benefit gluten free casein free diet cure may part original cause known teratogens cause autism seem work around weeks gestation may worth try attempted without professional nutritional advice especially picky kid clearly holy grail another point gluten creepy gliadin zonulin good combination make one wants leaky gut something think
