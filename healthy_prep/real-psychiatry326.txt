currently largest mental institutions basic collusion governments levels business community enrich corporations set manage american healthcare system usual vulnerable people cost shifted cost shifting refers cost center accounting basically leads divisions within organization try save money budget shifting costs somebody else managed care systems lead kinds distortions care also happens outside agencies i told situation workers one county actually dragged intoxicated patient county line another county patient would longer financial responsibility cost shifting end result perverse incentives perhaps better example incarceration rather hospitalization estimates recent days ago treatment possible hospitalization may cost year opposed incarceration costing year cases taxpayers pick tab cost shifting occurred insurance companies health care systems correctional system insurance company dump patient severe mental illness jail cost thing patient hospitalized may receive one time drg diagnosis related group payment irrespective long patient stays hospital incentive get days whether stable maximize profit discharged patients generally expected go appointments discuss medications clinic profits visits minimal main problem many appointments missed cases many patients lack stable housing frequently end back emergency department back hospital hospitals bottlenecks emergency department many people discharged back street cycle ineffective care continues i attempt brief analysis problem i watched unfold years inpatient practice i demonstrate things changed detriment

mental illness incarcerated even make emergency department patient may end stranded emergency department days sent home bottle benzodiazepines handle detox deny suicidal consistently enough also mater inpatient bed capacity fewer beds full constantly bed capacity shut due managed care rationing people often released open beds foreseeable future los many cases zero days even people severe problems happen care mental illness addictions fall miserable standard documented many posts blog professional guidelines compromised treatment infrastructure destroyed managed care industry politicians actively supported continue support professional organizations stand chance pro business state statutes commissions stacked industry insiders federal legislation protects companies lawsuits

solutions problems companies power literally want spend dime patient severe mental illness receive comprehensive community services maintained housing cost year clinical services patient costs corrections departments per year patient currently costs managed care companies nothing transfer care local state funded assertive community treatment team managed care companies incur cost patient
