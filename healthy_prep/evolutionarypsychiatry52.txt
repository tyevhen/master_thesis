right heels little case study i wrote last time came paper jama made bit splash news effects fructose vs glucose regional cerebral blood flow brain regions involved appetite reward pathways i know sounds like nail biter stone temple pilots pretty penny ancient history i like fresh time signature used song paper tale two sugars glucose fructose fructose somewhat sweeter glucose metabolized differently paleosphere doubt agonizingly aware fructose example causes slight bumps insulin known work central nervous system increase satiety decrease reward value food compared glucose fructose also increase satiety hormone glucagon like polypeptide fructose decrease levels ghrelin appetite stimulating hormone let translate something simple rather paperspeak glucose increases insulin increases glp decreases ghrelin increase satiety decrease reward seeking behavior fructose barely increases insulin increase glp decrease ghrelin ingestion presumably still hungry looking next bag skittles rats inject fructose brain stimulates food seeking behavior inject glucose brain rats decrease food intake please inject fructose glucose brain rat factoid certainly interesting i hoping drink vat agave nectar much fructose get past liver anyway pretty oxidizing toxic bloodstream human rat brains appetite controlled hypothalamus sleep kinda lives also part hpa axis makes stress response researchers hypothesized fructose stimulates appetite glucose increase blood flow hypothalamus reward areas brain rustled humans stuck functional mri measure brain blood flow came data another good stp song may heard atlanta normal weight non diabetic healthy volunteers used men women average age women scanned follicular phase menstrual cycle volunteer scanned blood samples taken overnight fast drank glucose separate day fructose sweetened drink scanned minutes order drinks blinded randomized drinks described sweetener plus cherry flavored water participants asked rate fullness serum levels glucose appetite hormones insulin etc measured minute intervals injestion scanning serum levels fructose also examined see much got past liver complimentary rodent experiment gave rats fructose iv measured amounts fructose brain see made blood brain barrier interesting results well hypothalamic blood flow tended decrease ingestion glucose within minutes ingestion wheras fructose time points blood flow hypothalamus decreased glucose compared fructose drinks presumably meaning appetite decreased glucose ingestion decreased fructose ingestion glucose also decreased activity brain striatum fructose predictably plasma glucose insulin increased glucose ingestion whereas little increase fructose ingestion plasma fructose humans increase fructose ingestion compared glucose scary duh levels ghrelin leptin different two groups another hormone pyy lactate higher fructose drinkers glucose drinkers felt less hungry sated drinking whereas fructose drinkers still felt somewhat hungry quite satisfied drink rodent study fructose plasma translate increase fructose brain compared saline iv found rna fructose transporters glut expressed hypothalamus liver kidney small study rather interesting big difference straight fructose vs glucose brain appetite centers react one would tend think results glucose decreases appetite reduces food seeking behaviors whereas fructose really fill course one drinks straight fructose unless glopping agave nectar tea would interesting see soda version hfcs memory i think fructose glucose compared straight glucose fizzy hard blind one cherry flavored someone get me healthy volunteers enormously expensive functional mri machine drink vat agave nectar typical oral glucose tolerance test dextrose orange flavored concoction
