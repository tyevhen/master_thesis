i know often strikes me qualitative research one finds clinical psychological doctoral dissertations psychology journals without scientific merit demerit seems me nothing researchers failing quantitative researchers try quantitative research often without merit quite different reasons anything i elaborate comes qualitative researchers asking questions approaching topic manner far close forms thought constituting driving quantitative investigation one complains researcher 'oh need much bigger sample establish reliability researcher retort 'but i qualitative research i build rather test model i trying develop valid concepts assert reliably true generalisations please stop trying foist quantitative prejudices onto me apt response often enough 'well please stop framing questions answers way quantitative approach could really justice course times meet unthinking positivist critique good qualitative research i remember journal club meeting institute psychiatry london thirteen years ago discussed excellent qualitative paper josef parnas essential structure pre schizophrenic self disturbance young professor shall remain nameless scoffed sample size seven people made rather worthless parnas investigation embarrassing demoralising many students room tittered parnas despite even grumpier me perspicacious danish psychiatric researcher published profound work self disturbance schizophrenic prodrome also extensive quantitative statistically rigorous research diverse developmental genetic neurological psychiatric concerns head institute shall also remain nameless professed unable grasp parnas phenomenological work given knowledge quality danish scientist rigorous quantitative research could least failure understand value qualitative research may return theme seems me really clear possible value qualitative research help reflectively unearth articulate give voice otherwise merely pre reflectively grasped character significance meaning phenomenon imagine implicit grasp significance something implicit grasp certain phenomena looked various ways appear disparate nevertheless share something central might think schizophrenic symptomatology looked conceptual lens mary boyle richard bentall one accepts phenomenological reduction condition allegedly independently assayable behavioural cognitive signs symptoms i one sees concept schizophrenia construct phenomenon falls apart one naturally questions whether 'schizophrenia really means anything particular nevertheless intuition meet phenomena yet unarticulated sense fundamentally alike might instead push reject phenomenological reduction instead pursue qualitative investigation would la parnas develop quite different terms articulate unitary lived character schizophrenic experience develop theme qualitative investigation character phenomenon worthwhile must case actually phenomenon implicit grasp research makes implicit grasp explicit may also occasionally revolutionary inviting question unreflective grasp suggesting diversity previously obscured assimilated thinking i leave aside essential qualitative research actually meet phenomenon first hurdle qualitative studies i seen fall claim developing 'a model phenomenon look alleged phenomenon something like 'the experience nonagenarian insulin user 'the experience visiting relative hospital 'the experience gay asian man european city slightest bit obvious phenomenon earth imagine thing experience nonagenarian insulin user even imagine thing experience nonagenarian experience insulin user maybe many experiences nonagenarian insulin users perhaps even given different experiences person may different days different things meant vaguest terms 'experience even day point qualitative researcher may say 'well actually dr gipps i precisely assuming experience i investigating look properly title see i undertaking 'a qualitative investigation experiences relatives attending hospital psychiatric patients point however i want say 'ok aside question whether really counts scientific research fairly sure get go ordinary experience understanding live human life people different experiences looking experience seven people phenomenon studied instead variety different experiences situation unity resides object hospital experiences object fact given object unity lies ought note well abstract titular talk 'a hospital misleading nothing research suggests experiences visitors generalised hospitals nothing suggests distinct hospital either 'research paper ought called 'an inquiry seven people visited relatives st barts hospital th november inclined say day found coming st barts thing still wrong title word 'inquiry better suited i would suggest legal journalistic scientific contexts rather unstructured interviews journalist lawyer conducts inquiry something really one thing particular asking 'what actually go wrong i mentioned generalisation ought immediately acknowledge qualitative research least ought business generating generalisations someone might say 'i generating nicely fleshed concepts quantitative researchers go find widely instantiated reality however i believe misunderstands criticism criticism qualitative research ought fails generate generalisable claims certainly ought business investigating phenomenon considering widely phenomenon obtains criticism instead given intuition meet phenomenon instead looking tiny sample range different phenomena contingently related sharing vaguest possible sense object possible way done could interest significance would reliably generalisable knowledge understanding sometimes useful qualitative research best develops understanding business delivering knowledge happens obtain rather helps better grasp already know obtain contexts considered given insight people experience visiting hospital like new understanding develop probably irrelevant unless say therapeutic work individual thing would relevant would knowledge means please look experience visitors hospital listen say make service better given feedback highly important work may valuable research research honest reason dress 'an investigation experience visitors day hospital hyperbole driver probably misperception desirability scientific non scientific ways spending one time developing professional finally comment idea 'developing model word 'model clearly defined i want get stroppy however qualitative arena i rather go 'an understanding since word 'model often carries connotations either prototype representation something works qualitative research however gives 'whats 'whys 'hows talk models qualitative researchers seems me yet another way closely ape procedures forms representation quantitative research process make vulnerable losing sight real distinctive value process trying grasp qualities make phenomenon
