myself talking putative super object called 'reality putative object diverse language games i confess i still commit sin often though next writes finally i hard time understanding matters whether given delusional statement correct anything ever absolutely definitively correct i also unsure gipps means rule representation though i take mean would need kind external criteria could applied delusions rather individual delusions qua explanations anomalous experience want make kind evaluative judgment since delusional experience certainly deeply idiosyncratic personal i see could happen true much normal human experience rules representation veracity given emotional affective response example dreams day dreams hopes desires i think involves perfectly understandable misunderstanding intent i would agree much writes concern whether say delusional subject expressions inner experiences correct example someone says someone experience prodromally perhaps thoughts taken head inserted say given correct description experience i believe i certainly think knocks spots delusional subject since yes equally true avowal subjective experience i wrote 'talking teapots seemed thing delusional subject correct incorrect descriptions experience matters well part critique adequacy 'romantic 'psychiatric approaches psychopathology either think meaning delusional utterances recovered interpretation think seen meaningless shown fail describe something properly i think approaches try say much fail 'sit delusional experiences i turn comments nd ridiculously titled 'aporiae apophany pieces worries i considering thought disordered thought thought qua thought starts unravel i considering delusions beliefs begin damaged beliefs i plead unrepentently guilty charges next worries i proposing kind equal different status delusions whether means seems devaluing meaningless experience value well i agree equal different status bit i think example delusional beliefs say different ways understanding 'the world delusional subject occupying different 'framework etc i sure devaluing bit i guess depends context valuation i reminded wittgenstein said nonsense metaphysicians unwittingly proclaimed production fact nonsense important pay attention delusions i believe meaningful final analysis mean revelatory important fruitless patient clinician alike engage delusion may meaningless may reveal something state mind example may fragments meaning worked gradual establishing relational terrain meaning developed meaningful directions perhaps however last point i ought something i would maintain values meanings lives exclusively belief meaning value arises midst relationships others work craft humbling private relational attempts supercession narcissism etc relationships meaningful means i consider meaning 'relational i consider solipsism narcissism 'narcissism psychoanalytical sense death meaning harbour merely ghost living meaning goes find putative self contradiction i say experience thoughts removed one mind yet urge precisely content delusional subject thought er i think quite mad thing say though impossible experience individuated inclined say 'impossible experience i mean say experience best described thoughts removed one mind note thing thoughts removed one mind nothing like secondary sense i believe way make sense contents thought experience also suggests i sceptical verifying accuracy delusional subject claims inner experience rather i sceptical even makes sense talk verification seem meaningful place inner i believe 'ontological rather 'epistemological truth i certainly claiming true delusions making point delusions 'inner sense inner passivity experiences etc final point resist attempts explanation understanding delusions i believe resist attempts explain example understand origination attempts comprehend i understand meaning rather discover causes i would want say following would well try understand delusions may betray subject mind example themes may symbolically psychoanalytical somewhat associationist sense 'symbolise represent significant emotional theme may 'emblematise phenomenologists ontological sense self dissolution either gets projected onto world get reduced merely empirical posit something within world destroyed importantly i want urge pay attention way may 'over understand delusions haste make psychotic thought comfortable desire avoid sitting terrifying affects self meaning dissolution doctors patients may accordingly 'romanticise either actually forms world disintegration 'psychic retreat like modes world evasion
