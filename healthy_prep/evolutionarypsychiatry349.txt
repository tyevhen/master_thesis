putting yesterday post strong link depression fructose malabsoprtion women adolescents mind continued spin i woke morning questions read post probably diving one wo make nearly much sense without initial information first estrogen link study noted none participants prescription medicines except oral contraceptives oral contraceptives widely varying amounts estrogen study probably would small detected lot difference makes one wonder also postulated fructose malabsorption would make premenstrual dysphoria worse using explanation estrogen effect liver makes already low amount tryptophan made serotonin even lower however progesterone likely culprit premenstrual dysphoria depression well known side effect progesterone birth control methods look hormone levels diagram menstrual cycle estrogen higher second half month premenstrual dysphoria likely occur really spikes ovulation middle month progesterone quite low beginning rises steady levels much last part cycle drops progesterone also involved metabolism serotonin dopamine could related secondly i idea fructose malabsorption common i seen notes mentions around internet i mental note head rare i must thinking hereditary fructose intolerance cause liver damage quite rare probably much known fructose malabsorption i medical school i would remembered i mean everyone knows lactose intolerance fact fructose malabsorption common could explain quite bit increasing prevalence changing symptoms depression days sure studies small effects carbohydrate malabsorption quite large means good chance data meaningful lot people men women signs atypical depression characterized weight gain fatigue prominent carbohydrate cravings low levels serotonin thought trigger carbohydrate cravings carbohydrate thought increase serotonin levels brain unprecedented change western diets made high fructose foods readily available year round something never possible industrialization fructose malabsorbers depleted serotonin craving carbs munching sugary foods leading cravings vicious cycle ensues adolescents may vulnerable probably likely free fructose laden diet i discussed changes depression symptoms classical melancholia modern atypical presentation i pointed finger omega fatty acids may also involved fructose could common factor ironically fructose absorbed problem i wish i knew common fructose malabsorption ethnic groups besides central europeans forget straight zinc deficiency exorphins wheat causing schizophrenia relatively rare explain recent huge changes increases depression mental illness fructose malabsorption potential huge factor good many people prevalence holds true american population million people even much higher central european descent fact ethnic groups still means millions millions people alone bit fructose malabsorption also one jad helpful references fructose malabsorption symptoms irritable bowel syndrome guidelines effective dietary management fructose found three forms diet free fructose fruits honey high fructose corn syrup agave nectar etc part disaccharide sucrose glucose fructose also polymer known fructan found wheat vegetables turns constituents diets affect well absorb fructose glucose helps absorb fructose example amino acid alanine moderate amounts people ibs symptoms fructose malabsoprtion get symptoms ate sucrose balanced fructose glucose mixes immoderate amounts greater ml sucrose sweetened soda example paper even sucrose could cause symptoms exactly recommended diet quite effective ibs symptoms according study patients advised avoid following foods imbalance fructose compared glucose apple pear guava melon mango papaya watermelon star fruit honey anything following major sweetening ingredients hfcs corn syrup solids fructose fruit juice concentrate also avoid following foods large fructose load grams per serving balanced sucrose dried fruits especially apple apricot dates raisins pear figs prunes fruit juice canned packing juice fruit sauces including tomato paste chutney relish plum sauce sweet sour sauce bbq sauce high sugar fruits cherry grapes persimmon lychee apple pear watermelon coconut milk cream surely mean sweetened coconut milk cream coconut milk carbohydrate total per serving sugar fortified wines sherry port ml sucrose sweetened soft drink excessive intake confectionery items patients advised substitute apricots nectarines peaches pluma berries citrus ripe banana fruits glucose equal glucose fructose could also consume glucose powder glucose sweetened sports drink balance fructose load paper substitution emphasized rather avoidance whole food groups order prevent nutritional deficiencies one would want something scary like eat fat lieu pasta high fructose fruits bread fructans problematic ones avoided flour white bread pasta whole grain breakfast cereal muffins crumpets australian study crackers cookies leeks jerusalem artichoke onions less fructan effect others asparagus ditto onions i leaving chicory root rare foods best get paper see complete list patients encouraged substitute rye bread gluten free bread gluten free pasta rice crackers maple syrup gluten free cookies etc months diet adhered diet time frequently adherent folks substantial improvement ibs symptoms whereas nonadherers improvement dietary study ibs sufferers positive test fructose malabsorption depression scales administered would nice researchers threw couple though right please check jamie post fodmaps even information paleo style avoidance fructose fructans final food thought people vegetable fructans jerusalem artichokes onions leeks asparagus thought aid health feeding bacteria short chain fatty acid butyrate somehow decreases permeability gut one also get butyrate eating butter edited say sorry meant opposite fructans transformed oligosaccharides short chain fatty acids good bugs thanks avocado
