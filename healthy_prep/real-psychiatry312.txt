i read article science recently reminded me i subscriber article model rational thinking based neurobiology several critical brain structures prefrontal cortex pfc dorsal striatum ventral striatum anterior cingulate cortex interesting aspect model also takes account bayesian analysis uses build model make use unique neuroanatomical local structures come novel solutions uncertain environments

details bayesian inference example i never really seen referred neurobiological perspective new paper donoso et al makes connection introductory paragraphs human reasoning subserves adaptive behavior evolved facing uncertainty everyday environments situations probabilistic inferential processes i bayesian inferences make optimal use available information making decisions human reasoning involves
