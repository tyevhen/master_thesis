speaking harvard law school i said sure though i wondered i would say seeing doctors lawyers natural enemies kidding sort actually i great lawyer probably sleeps better knowing blog talk next week halloween link i really looking forward focus diet likely large actionable component mental health problems mental health expensive disabling however october st harvard food law society sponsored great event tedx talks obesity foremost obesity researchers country including willet ludwig lustig guyenet along many lawyers policy makers talking efforts encourage local agriculture vegetable consumption promotion commodities crops cafo operations talks freely available time maybe follow tedx website fascinating i frankly shocked willet dietary prescription based part epidemiologic evidence advocates cereal fiber polyunsaturated fats major portion prudent diet pro mediterranean diet whole foods quick say digested components think whole grain cracker fried seed oil sprayed vitamins equivalent nuts legumes anti saturated fat red meat pro poultry fish mostly stuck obesity heart disease used epidemiology small short randomized controlled trials evidence willet apparently nd th i forget cited person scientific literature huge conventional wisdom nutshell though stephan guyenet told me willet pro egg willet says food pyramid demonizing fats effect promoting low fat processed carbohydrates favor whole foods public health disaster rely epidemiology alone would still women taking hormone replacement therapy willet seemed convinced confounders easy account confidence breathtaking willet also dismissed anecdotes traditional diets weakest form evidence entirely wrong ignores compelling congruence healthy human diets across many cultures willet also said ancestral diets useful people lived want sigh willet eats kashi grains breakfast apparently ludwig talk began promisingly evolutionary history ended basic harvard school public health prescription healthy diet ludwig got lot media flack recently suggesting obese kids taken parents actual editorial wrote suggests foster care could option intractable cases i feel taken context i puzzled got cereal fiber cereal fiber viable level without processed foods seed oils epidemiology quick point substitute nuts legumes big mac week would measurable difference obesity time okay stephan guyenet quick point sleight hand substitution mean red meat bad well ludwig looked great slender inflamed looking apparently might interested speaking ahs seems thinking evolutionary health ways strayed conventional wisdom fold yet interesting stephan talk excellent mostly historical review changes american diet past years pointedly showed increases fat primarily polyunsaturated poultry consumption linoleic acid last years coinciding obesity diabetes epidemics major point gone home cooked foods high level fast food restaurant food pre prepared convenience foods home convenience kill likely important note heart disease decline past years though might leveling unclear due aggressive control high blood pressure dietary changes even statins make false proclamation heart disease increasing lately lustig anti sugar talk also pointed problems epidemiology prescription i told thursday night i could attend attend panel discussion came neutral sat fats pro omega anti omega anti branched chain amino acids anti mcts course anti frucrose would come whole fruit whole hog discuss anecdote fruit orgy orangoutangs seasonally develop insulin resistance put fat lustig seems feel fructose mcts bcaas damaging mitochondria lead insulin resistance thus anti corn fed beef corn fed beef higher bcaas grassfed apparently i know enough say whether wacky ludwig quick point evidence linking fruit
