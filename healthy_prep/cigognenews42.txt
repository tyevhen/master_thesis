incest devastating protector becomes predator point one rarely gets incest terrible birth imprint great force endures compounded many adverse events early life becomes deeply embedded endures lifelong force along way various stages system number options dealing trauma traumas early enough effects lie deep brain major impact brainstem since verbal system yet developed expect possibility cancer major biologic disease memory deep brain ramifications vascular problems heart kidney ailments breathing impairment part effects imprints happens serious crack defense system leaving person much vulnerable later trauma may hallucinations delusions become possible latter verbal cognitive system becomes functional hallucinations signal early preverbal brain system work meaning result primitive traumatic imprints case delusions later system working provide sort meaning experience one case i walking street patient suddenly ducked yelling ice cream vendor wanted kill notice content death approaching
