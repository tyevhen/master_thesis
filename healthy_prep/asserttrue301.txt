shocking might sound leprosy continues strike persons per year worldwide making much health problem cholera yellow fever one oldest known infectious diseases leprosy became first disease causally linked bacteria hansen made famous discovery connection mycobacterium leprae ever since scientists trying grow leprae lab avail like environmental isolates leprae defies attempts pure culture way grow lab infect mice armadillos doubling time days longest known generation time bacterium traditionally assumed difficulty growing leprae pure culture due organism complex nutritional requirements humans organism obligate intracellular parasite takes residency schwann cells peripheral nervous system doubt considerable truth assumption reason organism fastidious nutritional requirements fully known cole et al showed half bacterium genome inoperative undergoing decay genomic sequencing revealed leprae three quarters dna content quite robust cousin tuberculosis leprae remaining genes fully functional rest pseudogenes pseudogenes genes become inactivated loss start codons loss promoter regions introduction spurious stop codons introduction frameshift errors causes almost organisms contain pseudogenes dna human dna reportedly contains pseudogenes leprosy bacterium however unique approximately half genome tied pseudogenes gene becomes pseudogene effectively useless baggage junk dna continues long path deterioration evolutionary theory predicts genes eventually lost genome since carrying cost keeping puts organism disadvantage energetically curious thing leprae hoarder holds onto useless genes actually transcribes upwards fact recent study year old leprae dna recovered medieval skeletons comparing medieval version organism genome genome today leprae found pseudogenes highly conserved bacterium fact bacterium actually transcribes many pseudogenes lose time striking say least suggests transcription certain genes pseudogenes resulting mrnas silence deleterious genes could leprae ca grown culture certain combinations nutrients presented nutrients regulate deleterious nonsense genes otherwise normal operons regulate important silencers directly indirectly williams et al found many leprae pseudogenes located middle operons transcribed via fortuitous read various scenarios possible much work remains done meantime i could help little desktop science characterize leprae defective genes problem i went genomevolution org coge organismview pl entered mycobacterium leprae br organism name field genome information box click click features link see genes labeled cds meaning operative non defective genes separate line item shows utterly astounding genes pseudogenes addendum fasta file genomevolution org contains duplicates actual pseudogene count turns still huge number pseudogenes dna seqs links right side page allow download fasta sequences respective gene groupings simple text files containing base sequences coding strands genes i wrote lines javascript analyze base compositions genes pseudogenes i noticed immediately base composition differs two groups base content genes content pseudogenes content normal genes averages whereas pseudogenes typical value members genus mycobacterium thus clear pseudogenes normal genes leprae drifted direction noted cole et al others perhaps less obvious purine content shifted normal genes pseudogenes bear mind looking data one strand dna called coding message strand clearly tendency pseudogenes regress mean shift purine concentration particularly interesting indicates purine usage normal gene coding regions perhaps non randomly elevated shift content may seem particularly striking difference turns highly significant see following graph base composition normal genes leprae total purines vs codon base position red dots base one gold dots base two blue dots base wobble base click enlarge see text discussion make graph i looked dna coding regions normal genes determined average purine content well content positions one two three codons see purine content relative content segregates non randomly according codon base position red dots represent base one gold brown dots represent base two blue dots represent base three often called wobble base historical reasons unexpectedly greatest shift occurs base three usually case perhaps surprising clear preference purines base one red cluster centers plus minus standard deviation means average position one codon occupied purine time actually quite typical codons organisms i looked bacterial species far purines accumulate codon base one maybe future post i present data effect base two segregates content significantly organism total genome content centers median plus minus sd compare graph similar graph leprae pseudogenes base composition leprae pseudogenes codon position red dots base one gold base two blue base three click enlarge see text discussion evident base compositions three codon positions overlap significantly fact codon positions longer clearly defined spatial representation graph consistent widespread frameshift mutations dna causing bases would normally position one two three position randomly hence say confidence basis graphs many junk genes leprae harbor frameshift mutations question came first frameshift mutations silencing genes followed frameshifts still open know certain frameshifts indeed rampant leprae pseudogenome exactly leprae accumulated many frameshift mutations kept hoarding mutated genes unknown i said earlier much work remains done note graphs produced using excellent service
