i got link new american psychiatric association apa practice guideline today facebook feed entitled practice guidelines psychiatric evaluation adults updated version previous guideline name i pointed blog apa seems abandoned production guidelines exception extensive work cms determine whether administrative guidelines billing coding adequate i complained apa officials fact producing new updated guidelines i told two things first wait current guideline second guideline production updating seem wise use limited resources interpretation remark defeatist probably related fact everyone currently producing guidelines i guess nobody apa recognizes need set limits pro business pro government guidelines actively discriminate psychiatrists patients apart single apa president seems conventional wisdom using past years i read entire relevant section guideline involves first pages last section includes references abstracts methodology like bar graphs showing many experts agreed certain type assessment needed done initial assessment introductory release explained guideline based institute medicine iom publication entitled clinical practice guidelines trust i impressed work done iom past reading three previous books wonder makes sense read fourth additional references methodology introductory sections document release describes guideline modular nine different modules updated regularly separately good idea hopefully add timeliness process one goals guideline widely disseminated apparently anyone download document read usual legal qualifiers pointing limitations broad document like one considered standard care i see obvious reason mentioned concept legal one used determination medical malpractice really application medicine guidelines referenced gutheil appelbaum text third another source information standards care growing number practice guidelines must remembered however even well designed guidelines necessarily address possible approaches clinical issue guideline disclaimer clearly debatable court i read guidelines several things jumped me clear guideline written psychiatrists may say implicit i bothered fact first pages word clinician pops times word psychiatrist pops times would prevent clinician claiming done everything listed document therefore evaluation equivalent psychiatrist evaluation guild political issue i elaborate clear type expertise necessary use guideline i suppose minor variation first point technical expertise me always critical issue guideline gets around saying comprehensive document i would consider recognition acute medical neurological problems even chronic ones beyond scope psychiatric evaluation i would consider abbreviated list conditions necessarily render comprehensive document would certainly clinical value tedious list survey results document also discusses tests terms optimal ordering tests also specific kinds tests interprets tests basic example i would go back days oral board exam psychiatry frequent questions use lithium board examiners interested tests needed ordered initiate follow lithium maintenance therapy goal exercise certify safe practitioner psychiatry today world much larger number tests interpretations plans based tests critical line demarcation practice settings seek limit medical role psychiatrists apparent apa wants guideline widely disseminated related concern may learned much wide dissemination dsms years although partial financial incentive dsm releases apa may oblivious downside everyone copy manual pre dsm release rhetoric illustrates lot critics poor understanding dsm would used wide dissemination vaguely written practice guideline may effect common bias anyone social brain speculate motivations goals others psychiatrists endless examples various writers speculating public figure may asperger narcissistic personality disorder sentiment circles seems i copy dsm i diagnose people prevent similar co opting practice guideline nothing really surprising document assessment techniques either obvious things psychiatrists psychiatric trainees regular basis many qualifiers many approaches taken example issue coming back initial point clarify diagnosis could appropriately done initial interview mentioned several times useful cases patient embarrassed defensive particular aspect history regard document represents content process variables interview tip cap evidence based medicine even needed common refrain throughout guideline strength research evidence supporting low guideline interest i summarized guidelines statements table numerical letter designations translated follows numeral recommendation numeral suggestion letters degrees evidence reflecting high moderate low degrees evidence respectively table basically reads recommendation suggestion backed low degrees evidence using research evidence criteria standard clinical methods taking evidence based medicine absurd conclusion i talking refinements way history physical done years basic idea physician make diagnosis come treatment plan really question currently thousands clinical trials document positive treatment effects based inclusion criteria include standard evaluation patient recognition certain medical exclusion criteria guideline includes explanation unethical certain double blind placebo controlled trials study suicide aggression comment important clinical question anecdotal become statistical illustrate i currently inpatient psychiatrist patients i see admitted suicidal aggressive ideation behavior post discharge complication rate low incident suicidal aggressive behavior every discharges likelihood i effective placebo i really need clinical trial prove i something statisticians willing speculate problem information aspects evaluation critical aspect evaluation studied field lack studies leads number vagaries guideline possible illustrate range information exchange across number interviews optimal amount information exchange terms diagnostic yield enhancing diagnostic therapeutic aspects interview way advance technical aspects field without deference neuroscience psychiatry stuck essentially interview technology since significant advances looking information exchange occurs interview long standing omission probably best way advance central part clinical practice well deserved shot electronic health record two decades hearing nothing praise ehr revolutionize practice medicine save hundreds billions dollars shortcomings obvious severe even apa gets page guideline increasing use electronic record systems structured fragmented information common electronic record notes increase cognitive workload reduce quality communication among caring patient diplomatic way saying follow suggestions collateral information guideline unfortunate enough get either printout direct access ehr might spend hours reading hundreds pages discover document discharge date contains minimal information case lab testing ca determine dates testing done probably also encounter ehr template approach documentation provides series yes responses real information traditionally used current ehr plague specialists require high quality information plenty apparent general requirements guideline psychiatry top list inconsistencies present many places one better examples several qualifier paragraphs point descriptions may necessarily vague negotiate assessment terms time well clinical descriptions guideline says encourage stereotypical questions complete assessment time suggests quantitative measures like standard checklists i cringe i see term term included joint commissions statement pain assessment treatment know turned old chemist asking person ten point scale rates pain depression anxiety far quantitative measurement point psychiatrists physicians lost sight fact certain organ systems brain particular structure precludes quantitative analysis good thing authors guideline least attempt explain obviously subjective flexible evaluation eventually lead rigid quality measures also used quantitative point professional organization needs point measures fabrications business community government little medicine science apa say points guideline ca point quantitative measures used collaborative care mean thing serious dimension diagnosis lot reasons patients families tend take psychiatric diagnosis serious took me number years clinical practice i realized informed consent discussion i person include whether diagnosis life threatening cases like talking survivor near lethal suicide attempt obvious cases like major psychiatric disorder number close calls due substance use disorder less obvious i tell person condition life threatening treatment plan part overall treatment needs take account may associated discussion voluntary involuntary treatment well clarification position patient treatment associated rationale i think critical assessment made carefully documented continuity care purposes initial comments new treatment guidelines far perfect start get apa back track establish reasonable guidelines written psychiatrists practice psychiatry introductory material suggests method modify various sections needed another section probably new guideline treatment planning interfaces evaluation guideline george dawson md dfapa apa work group psychiatric evaluation
