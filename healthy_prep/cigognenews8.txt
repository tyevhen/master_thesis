originally published july let begin poor lonely mouse regarding womb life several months gestation fetus produces adequate amounts inhibitory repressive chemicals serotonin mouse fetus make serotonin close third trimester seems like mother supplies needed baby take mother low supplies fulfill developing baby lacks extrapolate bit human mothers first caveat seems me principles laws biology apply pretty much across many species true physiologic evolution mice might also true biologic evolution well following discussion indicates true lag ability experience pain ability repress considerable whereas beginnings serotonin production mice sometime third trimester humans seems begin slightly earlier research fetus seems indicate experience pain thirteen weeks conception really fully experiences pain weeks gestation bout five months life utero fully sensitive adverse events time see paul ranalli emerging reality fetal pain late abortion nrlc org guess begins even earlier critical time gestation fetus produce repressive inhibitory chemicals must ask help physiologically mother fetus begin manufacturing neuro chemicals sends mother says i soothe myself thanks help serotonin soother allthough pain killing aspects serotonin well known less known role affecting appetite gastric symptoms heart function short role normal development evolution particular new evidence points role actually shaping brain structures early fetal life see cote f et al maternal serotonin crucial murine embryonic development national academy science traumas early secretion serotonin evident fetus impact later serotonin output change significantly one reason see serious mental illness arising adolescence hormonal turmoil going weakening defenses permits fetal pain rise affect thought processes hence delusions hallucinations interestingly early secretory life serotonin functions control shape anatomic structure later carries pain controller evolves changes thus humans may significant delay secreting serotonin gestation rely mother pitch start making needs adequate supply baby chronically depressed apt low levels serotonin used fight pain way mother fulfill fetal needs way blunt impact adverse events i pain thus fetus developed residue unblocked free floating pain terror early gestation makes much vulnerable trauma birth infancy defective coping mechanisms later trauma double impact relatively undefended system low serotonin output imprint remains pretty much throughout life making task everyday living desperately need serotonin enhancing medication later life prozac zoloft medication blocking pain happened set foot planet know current research imprint gestation remains pristine pure lives whereas imprint birth produce compensating secretions blunt impact trauma infancy notion imprint means events create irreversible dislocations function neurobiologic sysems way change return origin dislocation right ship needs push cry seems another biologic law whatever happens gestation alter basic physiologic set points rarely case birth compensatory mechanisms make dislocation function associated original trauma developing fetus effective repressive mechanisms trying borrow mother serotonin help avail completely na physical system frame reference tells basic physiologic processes deviated gestation system deviates considers deviation normal baby born inadequate serotonin gating capacity deficiency follows throughout life already wounded organism wound almost one see even imagine grow chronically anxious unable concentrate focus may well add unable sit still activation goes incessantly shows panic attacks happens system vulnerable gating weak imprint gestation rises top shouts message almost one decipher mystery origins arcane example girl born wartime mother chronically anxious husband sent war left alone anxious mother transmits baby considerably weakened fully repress hold pain time infancy happens already weak vulnerable baby chronically agitated may beginnings serious mental illness obvious human eye damage done often ascribed heredity one imagine already happened womb kind free floating anxiety seems specific time origin remember purely physiologic reaction originated time higher brain centers process event recapture must retreat primitive brain may see many decades later panic anxiety attacks much later cerebral stroke imprint would militate cancer cancer develop often need massive repression need massive secretions neurojuices serotonin would exacerbate risk cancer events later infancy childhood unloving stern parents result person never outlets pain shuts person growing violent father mother strict religious household one turn force imprint may well affect brain person sixties earth access remote experiences time ideas help know high level brain function incorporate previous lower level early memories become elaborated higher levels brain function incorporated levels relive non verbal pain trauma infancy time reliving residue earlier womb life events united resonance factor makes higher level brain function trigger deeper remote feeling put differently early preverbal imprint ramified higher levels feeling fully higher level automatically feeling earlier aspects feeling react events adult life see therapy may one cause erectile dysfunction feeling overwhelmed even slight pressure function present inability get going work summarize seems time gestation pain noxious stimuli impinge yet able produce gating chemicals serotonin endorphin resulting un gated pain i refer gating i refer electrochemical process blocks transmission pain message across synapse residue continue may lead bouts anxiety later life becomes free floating unbound fear terror focused elevators phobia born due heredity rather experience womb part utero life therefore takes hurt time system nothing nevertheless affects later development may suffer panic attacks began life early months mother pregnancy pristine ready spring forth whenever vulnerable talk therapy make dent involves vegetative primitive nervous system adequate register pain terror womb life nervous system impervious words understand respond insights leave absolutely indifferent womb experience leaves fragile lifetime insult lack love infancy childhood weakens need drugs work lower brain centers intellectual order suppress imprints time much severe mental illness causes early lives nature later provides useless intellectual tools address let primitive nervous system take charge lead way knows path liberation
