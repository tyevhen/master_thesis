every morning someone 'morning person endeavor would unthinkable many breger patients psychotherapists training many therapy experienced unsatisfying traumatizing relationships therapists sounded rigidly engaged therapeutic stance lacked empathy warmth degree kindness humanity dr breger broke mold patients seemed comment kindness attention non judgmental stance cared qualities found healing seemed mention great insights spectacular interpretations brought one patient cookies thoughts nice guy i think i like talking i love cookies presents therapy corrective healing response often good critical damaging childhood relationships bit felt repetitive patients said things thanked appreciated contrasted prior therapists personally related devil patients like full gratitude even wonderful psychotherapists wonderful everyone chemistry particular patients manage find fault everyone i went brief phase feeling annoyed dr breger narcissist write kudos ah redeemed later book tells wrote long term patients psychotherapy seemed helpful want trouble people would distressed request communication mentions people left therapy early one even got better medications want psychotherapy research study double blind placebo controlled results fair game publication type project knowing patients existed acknowledged reasonably respectful terms left realistic honest i liked book intensely personal

doctor least i healed enough released hospital nice able reassure patients seems colleague cover enough i never want indispensable dr breger psychoanalyst training analyst shows way looks problems result childhood least long ago events little room paradigm allows genetics biology illness shy however discussing disdain psychoanalytic practice abstinence rigidity coldness adherence theory leaves little room individual differences theory asserts practiced way thrust upon patients buy interpretation resistant seems found way draw positive helpful aspects psychoanalysis abandoning parts make impersonal rigid even mean therapy completed doctor patient relationship left patient cases breger becomes friends patients continue various forms contact ranging holiday card visits others homes meals sense different world professional life hard imagine purposeful going social relationships including spouses former patients perhaps difference psychiatrist non analyst practicing different decade different state california rules right thinking book teaching tool young therapists psychiatry residents training i sure value lies contrasting warmer responsive therapy traditional psychoanalysis i aware young psychiatrists entering training traditional psychoanalysis perhaps function i practice still book provides historical perspective difficult capture psychoanalysis fades primary treatment mental disorders biggest strength little book however breger easy writing warm inviting caring style pages quick compelling enjoyable read written man whose masterful skill psychotherapist weaves every page
