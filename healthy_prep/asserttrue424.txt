keep harping amazing power desktop omics tools i thought i share tip genome mining tip nutshell gang load bunch fasta sequences dna sequence data featview form genomevolution org click rather inconspicuous button labeled phylogeny fr bottom left featview page taken automatically phylogeny fr get realtime generated phylogenetic tree based sequence data provided featview effort part truly one click operation copy paste dna sequences featview click one button seconds later tree shows screen looking perhaps something like reason i made tree i satisfied knowledge relatedness certain weird microorganisms i recently run namely ralstonia i mentioned yesterday weird turns hydrogen gas co plastic bordetella bronchial infection agent weird turns similar genetically ralstonia burkholderia soil organism human animal pathogen weird unexpectedly large amount genetic similarity ralstonia polynucleobacter polynucleobacter ditch water bacterium weird live intracellular parasite freshwater ciliates live independently soil making potentially great study organism determining genetic bases intracellular symbiosis thiomicrospira tiny co sulfur loving organism weird found near deep sea thermal vents see previous writeup polaromonas relatively newly discovered still poorly understood bacterium weird abundant glacier ice multiple continents plus amazing totally unexpected amount genetic overlap good friend bordetella whooping cough bug familiar bacterial classification works let say mess long historical tradition classifying microorganisms based hodgepodge ad hoc methods involving everything physical appearance microscope especially staining crystal violet habitat organism ability metabolize various substances ability make spores adaptation oxygen lack oxygen serological characteristics etc always error prone system resulting many misclassifications later corrections owing inconsistency basic irrationality put bluntly advent molecular genetic techniques possible create accurate phylogenies based little dna sequence differences usually involving ribosomal rna freshwater ciliates like euplotes home polynucleobacter endosymbionts big advance ribosome based phylogeny pretty far ideal imho mainly ignores phenotypes fact pretty far removed anything organism ecology metabolism mode living etc really measuring measure relatedness according ribosomal yardstick rate random mutation accumulation pretty uninteresting cell artifact i rather yardstick tied phenotypic reality slow change highly conserved piece cold dead scaffolding create family tree two dozen microbes i said hell ribosomes decided use yardstick genetic variation groel gene codes kilodalton heat shock protein i chose protein rather gene phylo yardstick number reasons first dna sequence sizable nucleotides making somewhat bigger rdna important large yardstick gene looking faint genetic signals secondly protein essentially universal prokaryotes ubiquitous necessarily highly conserved sense rrna highly conserved highly conserved want think taken extreme highly conserved sequence invariant never changes therefore useless phylogenetics thirdly groel heat shock protein multiple intracellular touchpoints known interact groes aldh dihydrofolate reductase involved signal tranduction induced heat hydrogen peroxide overlook obvious also touchpoint protein enzyme repaired kda heat shock protein probably dozens hundreds enzymes important think protein sensitive conformational requirements proteins evolve response needs proteins services thermophile thermomicrospira going need different heat shock repair system psychrophile polaromonas salt lover needs different one freshwater lover groel reflect structure many shifting requirements host proteome considerations make groel highly appropriate basis gene phylogenetic analysis frankly i think groel based phylo tree phylogeny fr spit me see illustration speaks remarkably informative accurate tree groel evolutionary differences accurately grouped endosymbionts together soil organisms together aquatic organisms etc also correctly grouped enteric alike erwinia coli shigella cannily put polaromonas soil organisms rather aquatics i think correct based recent polaromonas isolates found soil rather snow likewise good see bdellovibrio freshwater bug clustered polynucleobacter symbiotic ciliate protozoan thiomicrospira saltwater hydro vent organism nearby node get infection hospital pray clostridium difficile often deadly harder call make clostridium difficile present non ill people intestines enteric la coli definitely clostridia botulism tetanus etc spore forming soil bacteria placement tree far soil dwelling spore former bacillus thuringensis thus eminently correct bacillus proximal node relative clostridium understandable bacillus aerobic whereas clostridia strict anaerobes buchnera aphid symbiont comes odd location much away insect dwelling wolbachia i would predicted buchnera host feeds cold sap wolbachia hosts typically feed warm blood organisms around wolbachia tree hemophiles good friend bordetella pertussis fame placed firmly soil group i think real significant start look bordetella high dna sequence similarity ralstonia burkholderia would surprising actually fell anywhere else tree honestly i took bacterial ecology college many years ago duress i hated experience decades later i starting like tools like available free genomevolution org phylogeny fr like
