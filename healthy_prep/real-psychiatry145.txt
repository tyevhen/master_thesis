example clear gets terms illustrating problem electronic health record ehr software associated hype government mandates idea need ehr given i arguing point i arguing current software inefficient par many ways software i using pc high maintenance tremendous burden physician use also vastly overpriced end overpricing sight largely due monopoly manufacturers use licensing model software like practically every process medicine days implementation actual use ehrs highly politicized process far removed people use every day example i tasked basic titration gabapentin according recent research protocol doses used generic mg capsules gabapentin purpose simplification dose titrated days mg tid three times day mg tid people reading may picked prescriptions instructions typed label increase dose therapeutic level settings particular medication used repeatedly across large patient population rate titration capsule side may need varied concept question i get information pharmacy medication dispensed patient effective manner old days paper records early hybrid models orders medications entered text based computerized record i would enter orders onto paper order sheet pharmacist would either write parallel record pharmacy needed enter computerized pharmacy software mar medication administration record would used nursing staff record administration time administration every medication set checks balances every dose medication checked point physician nurse pharmacist clinical pharmacists would often close relationships inpatient nursing medical staff relationships instrumental came dosage changes using novel medications making sure medication given scheduled entire chain events case low dose gabapentin prescription would start simple handwritten order like one written notoriously bad handwriting i think perfectly legible i wrote show two places capsules used mg increased three days importantly i turned stopwatch i started write order took me minute seconds compare recent effort using ehr scratching red top post basically worksheet enter medication without making mistake overall titration except starting dose mg three times day large differences case physician responsible entering medication pharmacy record mar time convenience done software dependent available software two possibilities add new line gabapentin doses hs noon doses respectively three days rewrite adjacent blocks gabapentin doses ultimately mg tid dose difference first procedure involved three steps second procedure four steps step also involves writing comments section order make sure confusion multiple doses gabapentin end given course day example red diagram single gabapentin mg dose bottom column th i might enter single gabapentin mg dose one time dose using standard ehr generate four five separate orders simple titrations first time using top method took me minutes end i broken cold sweats i double check text orders sketch boxes shaped checks mar i ended calling pharmacist giving verbal version sketch back second method took me total minutes basic example illustrates huge problems ehr fewer people hands medication orders may may immediate double check pharmacist nursing staff longer entering mar double checking looks entire task associated time shifted physician happened clinical pharmacists also disappeared floors hype newer safer systems apparent example go wrong ehr titration traditional methods even clinical pharmacist end reading approving hundreds order entries time added physician ehr classic example numerous jobs including billing coding transcribing data entry used done pharmacist added physician burden years physicians unlimited time additional tasks time constraint increase likelihood errors ehr minutes patients add even mildly complicated order easily take twice amount time administrators view plus jobs eliminated physicians never get paid administrative time apparent enterprise wide ehr financial burden organizations jobs need eliminated pay often many jobs physician workload assumed software th century sophistication without report writing capabilities data analysis anyone used spreadsheet database software used intensive data entry approach used modern ehr extremely expensive federally mandated piece software clunky use take me times long enter order software writing piece paper final report hospitalization phone book sized incoherent document little information density i think constraints apply i include time takes direct conversations pharmacist clarify entered ehr every home computing environment days least partially object icon based minimize typing possible case medication entry obvious solution would allow physician point click medications mar typing select medication dose enter directly mar mouse clicks would easily beat time writing would accurate either approaches i wrote i speculate business political incentives place resulted current ehr environment lot clearly documented health care
