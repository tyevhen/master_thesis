exacerbation copd asthma basically defined diagnosed clinical symptoms associated rapid decline lung function increased mortality frontiers microbiology october starters lengthy somewhat obsessive look personal episode illness implications common threads blog overidealization general medicine dislike psychiatry inaccurate comparisons psychiatry rest medicine wild criticism psychiatry etc would good place stop move i work past days upper respiratory infection leading exacerbation asthma least one theory i first noticed i stepped ergometer trainer weeks ago noticed i seem able take deep breath i wheezing mildly i saw internist next day history examination got chest ray electrocardiogram normal decided double dose corticosteroid inhaler i using told me increase double dose albuterol inhaler i using said would add oral prednisone point i got home i realized corticosteroid inhaler empty i needed new one office contacted sent prescription previous dose rather new dose i called asked read documentation note mentioned even higher dose possible inhaler i using inhaler cost one month i figured easier start using rather wait sort communication problems especially physician available another several days i still wheezing two days passed breathing seemed slightly better i went work mid afternoon inability take deep breath came back i went urgent care clinic health plan right work new doctor repeated history physical chest ray negative prescribed intensive course therapy day prednisone taper starting mg day nebulizer machine ampules mg albuterol told me keep taking inhalers add i got home i took prednisone assembled used nebulizer i digress say i firm believer absolute need control blood pressure pulse i measure blood pressure pulse four times day depending circumstances white coat hypertension probably happens many people know blood pressure get back home i know personal experience hostile work environment drive pulse blood pressure roof days weeks months time i comfortable hypertensive i exercising physiological i monitored sports physiologists happy i know compensatory post exercise response controls bp pulse long run i take physicians agree homeopathic amount antihypertensive bp never greater cdc recommended cut blood pressure usually points less belief comes seeing many people years decades untreated hypertension either physician seemed attribute something else psychiatrists occasionally situation treating patients extremely high blood pressures like greater systolic diastolic refuse treatment usually seen psychiatrists need get court order treated often takes several weeks putting patient risk i seen full spectrum blood pressure related problems one logical conclusion blood pressure needs well controlled i also student respiratory viruses veteran two different avian influenza task forces task force experience left me quite pessimistic ability fight actual pandemic reason quite striking denial airborne route infection everyone task force focused hand washing controlling fomites little focus needed contain airborne infections probably learned capacity would overwhelmed first day pandemic point basically slightly better position influenza epidemic one point showed couple plastic covered pallets tamiflu government warehouse somewhere i stopped attending started talk dead bodies would stored interest also area common everyday respiratory viruses working hospital era ventilation systems contain air save heat witness staff around patients get ill mini epidemics times year symptoms varying severity end antibiotics end medrol dose packs happens whether wash hands point i started mail minnesota department health inquire respiratory surveillance flu flu like illness point got tired email put online bottom panels show lag time likely viral culprits based various identification methods rhinovirus adenovirus among usual suspects reading copy gorbach bartlett blacklow confirms syndromes kinds trends i would see every year i consulted top expert airborne viruses building done first studies confirm viruses sampled airflow buildings typically airborne viruses two years i studied airflow filtering characteristics buildings older ventilation systems might modifiable reduce risk respiratory infect airborne viruses i looked specific air flow characteristics building i worked i surveyed employees unit showing high clustering upper respiratory infections flu like illnesses entire time i got numerous respiratory infections exacerbations asthma according following graphic matter time click enlarge initial nebulizer treatment systolic diastolic blood pressure i feeling somewhat agitated anxious i one nebulizer treatment life years ago i looked doses found inhaler contained mcg albuterol compared mg nebulizer greater bioavailability words nebulizer delivered times dose i told use times day i slept hours night next day i ran drug interaction search revised list medications several potential drug interactions noted couple significant i logged health plan sent personal internist note several question interactions drugs existing medical morbidities called me concerned i might flu i seen referred extensive immunology evaluation flu shot got i told experience nebulizer chuckled er might give hours course hooked monitor checking blood every hour point i single blood test suggested i try new inhaler levalbuterol equivalent nebulizers supposed fewer side effects i spaced treatments exactly hours five minutes third treatment heart rate shot beats per minute blood pressure i took medication i knew would bring minutes also prepared call continued climb gradually course minutes blood pressure pulse recovered concluded latest foray healthcare system medical knowledge may lead improvements far i tell nobody receptive idea respiratory viruses exist hand washing helpful necessarily protect worst viruses unreceptive parties occur administrative levels seem content watching employees get recurrent viral infections use paid time form cost shifting syndromal diagnoses alive well medicine psychiatry i talked physicians week long bout illness none clear diagnosis exacerbation asthma asthma talking specific type subtype may implications treatment good old heterogeneous type heterogeneous every known psychiatric diagnosis first physician thought likely cause dry winter air time i seen second physician i additional symptoms suggest uri personal physician seemed concerned i may influenza called me back second day make sure i developed fever i vital signs determined peak flow meters oxygen saturations chest rays electrocardiogram none tests biological test asthma whether underlying infectious agent none tests positive could quantitate illness recall typical argument rolled psychiatric diagnoses specific test syndromes i learned clinics health care system longer rapid test influenza considered accurate cases i treated based syndrome nothing else could specific diagnosis worthwhile certainly since evidence rhinovirus common cause asthma exacerbations may also cause asthma childhood also evidence rhinovirus replicate rna lower respiratory tract days post infection recently discovered rhinovirus inhabits lower respiratory tract replicate biological test done influenza longer used inaccurate would useful know i previous post asthma endophenotypes endophenotype rhinovirus induced asthma caused epigenetic mechanisms parallel questions psychiatric researchers working right major psychiatric disorders cost shifting patient paramount several sources i purchased inhalers days covered insurer first one error would covered weeks treatment match documentation original note three cases pharmacists warned me high cost inhaler i asked generic substitution said none current albuterol inhaler also generic apparently environmentally friendly one difference copay copay also angle perspective ethical purism pharmaceutical manufacturers case made samples patient try sample inhaler doctor office make sure tolerate know price going pharmacy way would assurance patient could tolerate afford expensive medication i currently inhalers used twice otherwise worthless me scenario difficult contemplate person forced drive away pharmacy without medication due surprise cost copay minimal discussion side effects contingencies scripting noted scripting public relations initiative health care personnel trained ask questions patient may asked satisfaction survey example end visit physician says additional questions me today week later get survey rate physician whether asked question meantime warnings prednisone i got hypertension tachycardia albuterol i told i might expect palpitations might expected medicine inhaler levoalbuterol supposed solve problem resulted significant tachycardia i later learned pulled hospital formulary work advertised optical isomer protect side effects like tachycardia pattern matching implicit probably carries day i previously written importance pattern matching medical diagnosis probably significant factor physician encounters looked me could tell i acutely ill i need go hospital various ways phrasing conclusion uniform pattern matching also probably drives lot questions flowed patterns asthma exacerbation previous patient encounters complex medical diagnoses process blog i pointed checklist screening generally inadequate approach probably better example logging health care system triage software realizing problem listed among choices case information changed time asthma due cold air asthma due viral exacerbation treatment also significantly expensively changed along way asthma related conditions huge public health problem prevalence asthma developing countries accounts every deaths worldwide people asthma well controlled public health interventions seem like last resort trying get people interested true nature airborne viruses prevent cyclical infections practically impossible far i tell i corresponded head cochrane collaboration section physical interventions interrupt reduce spread respiratory viruses cautioned me one knows uris spread many interventions work even world health organization initiatives seems leave important aspect building design airflow seems distinct medical bias comes respiratory infections potentially useful cost effective public health interventions i may availed myself pneumococcal vaccine polyvalent pneumovax vaccine influenza vaccine related issue much epigenetics comes play specifically epigenetic modifications occur environmental exposure let say rhinovirus possible exposure rhinovirus causes long term health problems kids exposure cigarette smoke even possible elegant hypothetical molecular mechanisms disease translate well clinical medicine case asthma mental illnesses skeptics critics psychiatry seem know nothing molecular biology frequently use rhetoric without understanding little mechanisms apply major diseases cytokine signalling alone described staggering complexity long term behavior system essentially unpredictable brain complexity far greater use prednisone shut inflammation shotgun approach shutting inflammation rather anything disease specificity given fact endophenotypes actually diagnosed point viral infections often associated acute onset asthma would seem lot diagnostic specificity beside syndromes also question time course improvement people ideas quickly medication prescribed psychiatrist take work ideas accurate hand i day treatment asthma i still ill real treatments based elegant biological mechanisms supposed work faster end i reminded psychiatry different rest medicine deals complex heterogenous conditions diagnoses imprecise focus patterns pathognomonic gold standard tests management side effects medications important treating underlying problem least non acute situations information transfer patient physician imperfect nobody seems working ways optimize anything critical time domain restricted businesses governments businesses governments seem completely disinterested non medical approaches reducing disease burden like building design plenty false positives best assurance get single physician knows best despite medical care i received past two weeks i think decisions i make ask myself people medical training decide situation know information relevant must mind boggling despite technology medical knowledge lot information transfer still comes happens patient doctor enough time happen meaningful patient know problems occur true doctors specialties george dawson md dfapa supplementary information supplementary material graphical primer allergic asthma exacerbations asthma may occur rather airborne allergen respiratory virus triggers cascade events leads flare top figure fact still recently elucidated example rhinovirus common initiator recently demonstrated rhinovirus replicates lower respiratory tract rhinovirus
