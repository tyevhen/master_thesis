i would say cardiologists still believe cholesterol lower better diet serum liver arteries however safe say super low cholesterol better brain dry weight brain fat cholesterol vital synaptic function low cholesterol seems associated alzheimer suicide violent death association depression spurious turns however people bipolar disorder also seem lower cholesterol gets lower mixed manic episodes uncomfortable combination mania depression particularly hard treat also manic episodes mood swings remit cholesterol tends get higher one really knows means sort biomarker inflammation low cholesterol cause problem yes bipolar disorder depressive disorders associated metabolic syndrome especially bipolar disorder link serum lipid alterations much stronger high triglycerides high ldl total serum cholesterol also interesting depressed folks high cholesterol less likely respond antidepressants folks low cholesterol i already discussed low cholesterol serotonin receptors low cholesterol suicide two different subtypes serotonin receptor seem particularly affected low serotonin associated violence suicide necessarily depression intriguing low cholesterol associated chasing original paper sparked post journal clinical psychiatry user unfriendly interface i hate i find papers i came upon meatier paper mixed manic episodes led number neurotransmitter brain stuff cholesterol papers neurochemistry bit heavy strap nice graffiti song make wash easier right click new tab big picture cholesterol use brain made brain however autopsy studies show cholesterol levels brain correlate rest body statins cholesterol lowering medicine cross blood brain barrier likely similar effects brain liver least work golomb seems suggest case know previous posts need cholesterol proper myelination nerve fibers myelin insulating electrical conduction also specially designed nerve signals run faster demyelination slow fritzy conduction big problems multiple sclerosis know need proper serotonin signaling hta ht receptors particularly affected serotonin ht cholesterol also stabilizes serotonin transporters cholesterol critical component lipid rafts lot membrane communication transpires low cholesterol suicide i also made brief note cholesterol may involved gaba nmda receptor signaling opioid signaling transport excitatory amino acids rather big deal comes totality brain signals information today i wanted review little detail glutamate excitatory amino acid question transport may entirely altered cholesterol depletion least mice seems affect sodium powered transporter directly i talk glutamate lot fact last week i called excitatory neurotransmitter doom almost every paleo intervention ketosis decreased inflammation enough nutrients like magnesium proper sleep meditation paleo course i feel emulates necessary moment hunter gatherer would face hunting gathering collecting building etc seems modulate glutamate way favorable neuron plasticity repair sad stressful modern life promote glutamate excess tend cause neurotoxicity eventually neuron death oops glutamate work instead energy right machinery send glutamate transporter right place right time skunking transporters depleting cholesterol seems like crazy bad idea one places glutamate acts nmda receptor turns nmda receptor needs rich cholesterol work nmda receptor depleted cholesterol potential may fire differently irregardless amount glutamate gaba rather like glenda good witch compared glutamate wicked witch west gaba transmission relaxing literally like nice glass wine affects gaba receptors yoga seems increase gaba key areas well cholesterol depletion decreases gaba transmission seems rats least depletion major excess cholesterol high normal low normal rat study low gaba signaling anxiety irritability sleep problems symptoms associated statin cholesterol lowering drugs according golomb symptoms also prominent mixed manic episode start today bipolar disorder finally opiate good old opiate opiate receptors surprisingly along dopamine involved reward system brain several varieties opiate receptors delta receptor associated mood effects subject complicated i rather conquer posts short version cholesterol depletion seems reduce signaling capability delta opiate receptor neuronal cells could course presumably affect mood perhaps surprising cholesterol part body absolutely brimming explicit effects nearly every signaling pathway ever heard i get little bit perturbed realize many statin studies people psychiatric illness excluded people mental illness make rather large percentage population nimh says adults given year happens take brain already firing little deplete cholesterol gosh sure would nice know recommend statins large percentages population oh wait seems already done fair large analysis statin trials looking new onset mental illness perhaps caused statins finding case though acknowledge dietary interventions lowering cholesterol non statin drugs cause issues suggesting yes indeed cholesterol important brain perhaps magical anti inflammatory effect statins thing saves plain old harmful everyone many trials excluded people previous psychiatric illness questions questions questions
