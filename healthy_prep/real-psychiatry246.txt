usual drive home work last night late night nights i get listen terry gross interviews fresh air two interviews i heard two excerpts speech content way delivered compelling gross typically replays interviews famous people interviewed right deaths interviews generally comprehensive offered insights person serve great memorials person work first excerpt interview christopher lee actor i seen many roles remember best work star wars lord rings died last sunday age sentences gross asks decided play dracula words listed interview occurred years ago would listen audio capture sentences delivered spontaneously lee i never thought i never thought vampire ever i mean blood life one thing bear mind man immortal man immortal lost soul man experiences loneliness evil something ca control wants die force malefic force drives terrible things i said earlier character heroic based real man war leader national hero i may say romania day vlad impaler second interview several people commemorate life jazz great ornette colman died week age discusses innovated type jazz controversial polarized people point would show clubs playing fights would break music people would swear try strike one musicians interviewed said witnessed coleman punched face music tells gross instructions fellow musicians play innovative style music ornette coleman i originally i told i said know bass basics music first learning play music instrument choose play secondly eliminate problems style get way think feel third get hung technique instrument play music anymore i demonstrated kind things since i first started i using trumpet bass drums lots musicians time simple me give information i figured equally interesting musicians interviewed descriptions coleman music times cherry denardo coleman charlie haden members ornette coleman quartet seemed evident me performances ground breaking dedicated musicians top game know work together one point gross asks ornette coleman question working son denardo comments nature question basically concludes likes work someone knows trying achieve i strongly encourage listening recording men descriptions interviews interesting me number perspectives first experience fantasies exploded watch lot films may time say i acts way every film certainly might true also might true seeing small fraction person particular role difficult appreciation everything went i seen robert deniro movies since first critically acclaimed role bang drum slowly i saw dilapidated theatre northern wisconsin apparent brought lot role i saw interviewed james lifton years later i appreciation level art exposed childhood early started acting easier appreciate genius musicians thing needed instrument feeble attempts trying create music even basic rock roll requires casual effort i trained play cello clarinet grade school high school like people let slide science athletics seemed important rudimentary training i think i safely conclude jazz especially creating entirely new controversial style jazz sign real genius excerpt interview charlie haden jazz musician bass player coleman charlie haden i years old played day long room full music strewn floor walls ceiling constantly writing music told me started play said charlie i written pieces chord changes chord changes i heard inside myself i writing melody guide i want inspired create chord structure

worked guy like ornette coleman less complicated work person told well basic structure job i really hope innovate within constraints create new ways difficult find areas life somebody kind vision terms people working together create something ornette coleman clearly i talk people living years typically minute initial interviews i like impose much structure i cover least information points varying degrees detail many people i talk like excerpt christopher lee brilliant command language vocabulary excellent i gauge many low frequency words tend use words ca jargon words access dictionary i taught one point rough correlation compound sentences intelligence i usually comment vocabulary sentence structure dictations record results interview cases i comment emotional impact objective observer someone standing room might affected psychiatrists limited range descriptors use largely field limited significant psychopathology fine clear situations descriptors occur majority situations i like push envelope explore situations i talking person people would see charismatic overwhelming aspect interview person talks reading answers book containing compound sentences low frequency words surprisingly different says consult request i make determinations i routinely another interesting aspect interviews time dimension course clinical practice common hear clinicians compare notes conduct clinical practice various external internal rules applied come duration interviews entire duration interviews lee coleman minutes less excerpted longer interviews psychiatry point decision psychiatrist made much non clinical discussion occur clinical discussion driven billing documentation guidelines determined governments insurance companies i found rarely accounts relevant treatment factors minimum source stress home work additional issue question requires detailed discussion interviews i hear amazing stories like charlies haden description meeting ornette coleman one kind experiences full range absolutely inspiring absolutely traumatic communicated me full range positive negative emotions everyone genius everyone story tell history give i spent life spinning information see syndromes hinterland two standard deviations past human behavior i really know happened point i realized importance information i realized somebody says much time doc want short
