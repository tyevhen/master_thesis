decades i hoping i live long enough see day serious science could done desktop dedicated amateurs amateur astronomers know i talking ca much particle physics desktop affordable desktop electron microscopes yet comparative genomics thing get ready rock roll friend weekend i discovered genomevolution org promptly went nuts let me take tour possible first i explain background microbiology i always soft spot heart literally organisms ultra tiny genomes things like chlamydia trachomatis sexually transmitted parasite technically bacterium ca grow dish requires host cell live turns many itty bitty obligate endosymbionts least dozen major families known small size obligate intracellular lifestyle lot common mitochondria say like mitochondria micron size divide circular dna provide services host exchange living quarters look one little creatures microscope whether chlamydia ehrlichia anaplasma see pretty much thing see photo namely tiny bacterium living cytoplasm mimicking mitochondrion lynn margulis wrote classic paper suggesting mitochondria tiny bacterial endosymbionts seemed laughable time ideas widely criticized fact paper rejected fifteen journals recalled taught school course long way go understand mitochondria work really really need know work one thing mitochondria seem deeply involved orchestrating apoptosis programmed cell death various kinds signal transduction understand works going hindered understanding cancer i discovered tools genomevolution org one first things i hell basis compare genomes two small endosymbionts wolbachia pipientis neorickettsia sennetsu former lives insects latter flatworms infect fish bats birds horses probably lots else note horse get potomac horse fever first neorickettsia infect tiny flatworm flatworm ingested dragonfly caddisfly mayfly horse eat maybe bitten although infection ingestion demonstrated worm infected fly parasite parasite chain events fascinating right suggests me parasites enable shared strategies biochemical level i might well spoil suspense revealing even yet another layer parasitism biochemical enablement going picture involving viruses getting ahead i mentioned wolbachia second ago wolbachia fascinating little critter found reproductive tract anywhere insects plus undetermined number spiders mites crustaceans nematodes cause disease fact appears many insects unable survive without wolbachia unusual extracellular phase lifecycle part spread one host another known one observed part incredible wolbachia adapted stem cell niche live cells give rise insect egg cells thus newborn female progeny infected mother infected eggs pass wolbachia sense genetics wolbachia obey mitochondrial genetics whereby mother passes organelle genome i quickly found via sunday afternoon desktop genomics wolbachia neorickettsia endosymbionts anaplasma ehrlichia etc many genes common hundreds fact i say genes common i mean genes often show better similarity dna base pair matching important put context little organisms dna encodes genes comparison coli around genes endosymbionts lack genes common metabolic pathways biosynthesize amino acids example instead rely host provide nutrients ready made endosymbiont genes shared across major endosymbiont families huge percentage suggests set core genes numbering low hundreds encapsulate basic strategy endosymbiosis little context mitochondria dna look lot like endosymbionts thing mitochondrial dna tiny base pairs versus million endosymbiont turns stuff makes mitochondrion encoded nucleus host include nuclear genes mitochondria actually rely genes total organelle dna lynn margulis would say happened endosymbiont ancestor today mitochondrion originally dna million base pairs genes time taking residency host cell invader dna mostly migrated host nucleus symbiont host dna migration stop look find genes coding trna bacterial ribosomes specialized protein making machinery plus genes enormous complex transmembrane enzyme systems cytochrome oxidase nadh dehydrogenase former endpoint oxidative respiration latter entry point obviously must advantageous genes proximal organelle even organelle physical compartment one might ask necessary mitochondrial parasite swimming around cytoplasm genes part host dna answer stuff goes inside confines mitochondrion needs contained violently toxic stuff involving superoxide radicals redox reactions proton pumps fenton chemistry transition metal peroxide reactions containment structure definitely called segregate toxic chemistry rest cell might ask dna protobacterial ancestor today mitochondria wound host nucleus first place let consider possibilities protobacterial symbiont dna may transferred host might migrated piecemeal time realistic huge amounts endosymbiont dna could migrated host nucleus yes suggested vacuolar phagocytosis drove invader dna nucleus big gulp evidence wolbachia inhabits vacuolar space export genes gene products host might occurred piecemeal well little desktop exploration provides clues use genomeview number online tools explore dna wolbachia several things pop first many wolbachia genes mitochondria like encode things like cytochrome oxidase cytochrome nadh dehydrogenase succinyl coa synthetase fenton chemistry enzymes slew oxidases reductases including nitroreductase wolbachia clearly engaged providing might called redox detox services host value proposition mitochondria offer makes sense wolbachia cells net drag respiratory potential host cell mitochondria could least hold respect mitochondria host would die second thing jumps look wolbachia genome abundance genes devoted export processes membrane proteins permeases type i ii iv secretion systems abc transporters etc plus least ankyrin repeat domain genes powerful evidence specializations aimed export genes gene products host stunning smoking gun presence wolbachia dna five reverse transcriptase genes plus genes resolvases recombinases transposases dna polymerases rna polymerases phage integrases essence complete suite retroviral machinery designed export foreign dna host dna example one phage derived genes wolbachia lower gene array case gene matches phage gene found candidatus hamiltonella upper gene array two isoforms exhibit dna sequence similarity despite widely differing gc ratios see text discussion wait third thing jumps straight face start looking wolbachia genome presence ready less genes phage related proteins including major minor capsid hk style prohead proteins plus tail proteins baseplate tail tube tail tape measure sheath proteins late control gene phage dna methylases non biologists phage term viruses attack bacteria screenshot i comparing wolbachia dna lower strip dna another insect infecting endosymbiont candidatus hamiltonella known contain intact virus phage dna many phage proteins wolbachia corresponding matches candidatus genome case looking gene gold colored stretch pointed red arrows nucleotides long sequence match across genomes match percentage remarkably high given candidatus version gene gc content wolbachia version gc also note wolbachia overall gc fact wolbachia putative phage genes significantly higher gc content wolbachia non phage genes good confirmation genes really phage clear viral dna made way dna wolbachia either recently long ago reasonable hypothesize wolbachia repurposed retrovirus like phage genes packaging exporting wolbachia dna host nucleus okay maybe biologist stuff make hairs stand end me dream come true able kind detective work sunday afternoon sitting living room couch using nothing decrepit five year old dell laptop wireless connection notion comparative genomics proteomics watching ancient aliens rerun tv me totally cerebrum blowing makes me wonder around corner
