since i reviewed basic premise homo sapiens walk around bodies brains exceptionally well suited hunting gathering small family groups wilderness evolved agriculture whole industrial agriculture particular i subscribe concept evolutionary medicine diseases civilization i focused mental health blog caused differences current lives evolutionary suitability replicating hunter gatherer life many ways makes scientific practical sense lead better health physical mental colin campbell phd full professor nutritional biochemistry cornell say follow evolutionary history support inclusion substantial amounts animal protein recommended dietary practice make error dietary evolutionary history interesting absolutely yield critical clues optimal nutritional practices human evolution required ancestors make dietary choices maximized gene proliferation i say maximized gene proliferation means living past well old age humans grandmothers women designed live years past menopause order favor higher overall birthrate grandmothers helped gather offspring offspring taught valuable cultural information textbook evolutionary psychiatry origins psychopathology could tens thousands generations selected relative longevity freedom disease mental physical based evolutionary diets me honestly makes sense view health data another perspective bizarrely campbell goes write chimpanzees eat plant based diet split chimpanzees million years ago preponderance evolution data must lean towards plant based low protein diet evolution entirely different species important explains theories

late mi okay decent argument brings me iceland way back infancy blog commenter iceland left me two links interesting information turns autosomal dominant genetic disease iceland called hereditary cystatin amyloid angiopathy caused mutant protein deposited walls small arteries leading brain hemorrhage death young adults average age since iceland everyone knows everybody family trees everyone disease deciphered studied turns deadly hereditary cystatin mutation occurred iceland sometime around carriers gene lived normal lifespans next years lifespan afflicted decreased change life span indication strong environmental effect penetrance mutation effect must common happened almost families simultaneously parts country time iceland changed traditional cow milk based diets western diet similar europeans one remote region iceland lifespan shortening occurred years later related family groups one later regions adopt western diet example autosomal dominant genetic disease seems affected diet brings me back huntington chorea last post i mentioned study showed carriers mutant huntingtin gene autosomal dominant gene complete penetrance meaning everyone gene gets progressive deadly neurological illness cure steady inevitable degeneration leading death years begins ages thereabouts much higher rate positive test anti gliadin wheat protein antibodies general population huntingtin gene probably codes type microtubule vesicle protein basically structural proteins anchor mitochondria nerve cells mutant deadly gene extra trinucleotide repeats cag coding unstable version huntingtin protein normal gene less cags row mutant gene trinucleotide repeats earlier disease seems strike wheat really weird part cag dna code repeat i talking cag genetic code amino acid glutamine mutant extra repeats called polyglutamine repeat number genetic diseases also caused polyglutamine repeat turns polyglutamine tracts also present gliadin wheat protein possible explanation body recognized abnormal polyglutamine tracts made cells abnormal gene wheat proteins looked lot like abnormal protein people huntington mounted immune response wheat proteins wheat protein exposure also associated non huntington ataxias could wheat gliadin polyglutamine exposure abnormal autoimmune response lead protein aggregation huntington disease words ubiquitous exposure dietary wheat protein modify natural history huntington disease somewhat like western dietary exposure seems modify natural history hereditary cystatin amyloid angiopathy one knows evolutionary perspective would lead one
