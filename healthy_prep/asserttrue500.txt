dimensionality hypersphere increases volume near surface pink red portions hyperspheres shown cross section contain volume 'n dimensionality common supposition knowledge something surface deep tantamount knowing nothing always true understand many facets complex topic perhaps deep level lack formal training facets mean understanding rounds zero hardly one way look suppose subject domain whatever happens represented conceptually sphere everything know subject maps region inside sphere total knowledge represents total contents total volume sphere sphere three dimensional half volume contained inner sphere radius overall sphere stay me moment even math person purposes discussion consider sphere radius called unit sphere comparison unit sphere sphere radius contains half volume unit sphere reason volume grows cube radius cube root i mean i say innermost sphere dimensional sphere measured terms radius contains volume sphere outermost radius bounds outermost sphere volume summarized topmost portion accompanying graphic see cross section sphere innermost half volume shaded pink outermost half shaded dark red boundary two half volumes starts point radius way center surface suppose consider hypersphere dimensionality middle sphere graphic one next volume sphere grows tenth power radius therefore inner outer half volumes delimited point radius way sphere center tenth root graphic depicts outer half volume dark red notice much thinner top drawing step dimensionality half volumes delimited radius point half volume hypersphere contained outer radius see i going dimensionality approaches infinity hypersphere volume contained surface dimensionality problem large enough willing buy simple volume knowledge model set forth earlier surface deep knowledge quite valuable indeed next time someone tells knowledge something surface deep consider number dimensions problem tell person dude dimensional problem since high case surface deep knowledge happens plenty let me explain
