i went favorite coffee shop day usual mocha typically post trivia question day gives cent discount coffee conference recent focus neuroscience interesting see question number thoughts per day wife ventured guess i asked barista source could tell me get internet like questions footnote reference available source difficult find typical internet site never impressed me knowledge source link original paper turns neuroscience site laboratory neuroimaging loni ucla read fine print bottom page qualifiers counts thought i looked papers estimate web site well medline come anything irrespective methodology question poses interesting questions clinical psychiatrists comfortable outside confines dsm much attention paid baseline conscious state patient might important stream consciousness every day disrupted mental illness addiction extent stream consciousness broken daydreams memories fantasies extent impacted process even suggested dsm best example i think boredom easily bored diagnostic criterion seems uneasy mental state people bored get driven things alleviate boredom sometimes activities risky thoughts mentioned coffee shop question memories fantasies daydreams large number i aware brief frequent thoughts stream conscious thought comprised coherent stories images i grand rounds fantasy daydreaming years ago never much quantitative work fantasy new research approaches daydreaming used time i incorporated references presentation i recall exact number daydreams per day considerably less research approximating numbers thoughts per day may research exact number spoken words per day research generally comparison men women test sex speaks words numbers across different cultures sampling periods range words per day standard deviation large authors conclude average sexes spoke words per day me speech language unconsciously processed thought even counting words get level coffee shop question authors believe way capture tens thousands unconsciously processed
