treatment influenza chinese medicine western medicine view influenza influenza spreads every winter accounts substantial mortality every year influenza viruses characterized high variability high infection rate called spanish flu killed estimated million people world wide first world war two pandemics occurred million deaths million deaths asian hong kong flu respectively recent large epidemic united kingdom estimated people died association influenza three types influenza virus influenza viruses found humans animals whereas found human beings infection influenza produces immune response production antibodies blood neutralize virus person encounters influenza virus antibodies still present body protected person develop infection characteristic influenza viruses especially virus frequently mutate sub types virus one step ahead natural immunity created body usually sub types develop epidemics occur antibodies produced protect individuals influenza virus surface proteins undergone significant change since previous infection example new subtype years ago hn avian influenza virus first isolated hong kong may previously found birds associated disease humans latest example sub type hn virus responsible called swine flu influenza viruses spread person person tiny droplets produced coughing sneezing initial site infection lining respiratory tract infection short incubation period five days virus shed respiratory secretions starting one day onset illness lasting three five days classic symptoms influenza include fever malaise headache aches pains muscles joints characteristic dry cough sore throat acute illness usually lasts three five days recovery may slow cough tiredness may persist two four weeks post infection complications may occur groups patients particularly risk underlying lung disease defective immune systems usually affect lungs heart upper lower respiratory tract infections common subsequent invasion lungs bacteria may result development pneumonia chinese medicine view influenza diagnosed treated properly without thorough understanding theory stages particularly levels beginning stages acute respiratory infection usually manifest symptoms invasions exterior wind shang han lun zhang zhong jing ad provided earliest framework diagnosis treatment diseases exterior wind cold although classic also discuss invasions wind heat treatment comprehensive theory exterior diseases wind heat developed late school warm diseases wen bing thus two schools thought form pillars diagnosis treatment exterior diseases chinese medicine separated centuries school cold induced diseases school shang han based discussion cold induced diseases shang han lun zhang zhong jing school warm diseases wen bing school started late early main advocates school wu ke ye tian shi wu ju tong ye tian shi author wen bing lun discussion warm diseases western medicine every external infectious disease differentiated according pathogenic virus

translation chinese term wen bing mentioned doctors school thought introduced important innovations theory wind chinese medicine school warm diseases postulates exterior pathogenic factors go beyond natural characters wind virulent strong matter strong person body may men women children fall ill dozen importantly first time history chinese medicine doctors recognized external pathogenic factors infectious innovative idea stemming school pathogenic factors causing warm diseases falling category wind heat enter via nose mouth rather via skin happens wind cold bearing mind wind heat intended broad sense may also manifest damp heat summer heat winter heat spring heat dry heat essential characteristics warm diseases therefore manifest general symptoms signs wind heat early stages always fever emission heat actual fever infectious wind heat penetrates via nose mouth pathogenic factor particularly strong virulent wind heat strong tendency become interior heat interior heat strong tendency dry body fluids thus although pathogenic factors contemplated school warm diseases fall broad definition wind heat diseases caused wind heat warm diseases exterior diseases start symptoms wind heat warm diseases mentioned characteristics examples warm diseases influenza measles chicken pox german measles poliomyelitis smallpox scarlet fever whooping cough meningitis influenza epidemic

therefore fails warm muscles aetiology pathology invasion exterior pathogenic factor due temporary relative imbalance body imbalance may occur either body temporarily relatively weak pathogenic factor strong body may temporarily relatively weak due overwork excessive sexual activity irregular diet emotional stress combination body thus weakened even mild pathogenic factor may cause external invasion wind wind indicates aetiological factor pathological condition aetiological factor literally refers climatic influences especially sudden changes weather body adapt pathological condition wind refers complex symptoms signs manifesting wind cold wind heat clinical practice important aspect concept wind thus diagnosis wind invasion made basis history need ask patient whether exposed wind basis symptoms signs person symptoms signs wind aversion cold shivering fever sneezing runny nose headache floating pulse condition one exterior wind matter climate person exposed previous days hours indeed also chronic conditions manifest symptoms wind treated even though relation climatic factors example allergic rhinitis due house dust mites pollen manifests symptoms signs wind treated influenza manifests primarily symptoms wind heat simultaneous cold feeling fever simultaneous fever emission heat aversion cold characteristic symptom beginning stages invasion wind indicate invasion exterior pathogenic factor factor still exterior level long aversion cold pathogenic factor exterior i shall discuss detail pathology clinical significance aversion cold fever beginning stage invasion exterior wind aversion cold exterior patterns aversion cold cold feeling due external wind obstructing space skin muscles wei circulates wei warms muscles obstruction wind causes patient feel cold shiver even pathogenic factor wind heat thus wei necessarily weak obstructed space skin muscles wind cold wind heat cause aversion cold generally speaking three aspects cold feeling invasions exterior wind patients feels cold waves shivers reluctant go wants stay indoors except mild cases cold feeling relieved covering oneself conclusion feeling cold exterior invasions due obstruction wei space skin muscles indicates pathogenic factor exterior soon feeling cold goes pathogenic factor interior fever fever chinese terms fa shao fa necessarily indicate fever fever sign modern western medicine old chinese medicine old china obviously thermometers symptoms fa shao fa described old texts necessarily mean patient actual fever literally means emitting heat indicates patient body feels hot almost burning touch areas touched forehead dorsum hands opposed palms fact characteristic fa called fever exterior stage invasions wind dorsum hands feel hot compared palms upper back feels hot compared chest objective hot feeling patient body may may accompanied actual fever although wen bing diseases symptoms shivers feeling cold occurs simultaneously objective sign patient body feeling hot touch actual fever indicates acute invasion external wind denotes pathogenic factor still exterior particular symptoms shivering feeling cold indicate pathogenic factor exterior moment patient feel cold longer feels hot bed throws blankets means pathogenic factor interior turned heat fever hot feeling body external invasions wind due struggle body zheng external pathogenic factor thus strength fever hot feeling body reflects intensity struggle depends relative strength external pathogenic factor strength zheng stronger external pathogenic factor higher fever hot feeling body likewise stronger zheng higher fever hot feeling body thus fever highest external pathogenic factor zheng strong therefore three possible situations strong pathogenic factor strong zheng high fever hot feeling body strong pathogenic factor weak zheng vice versa medium fever hot feeling body weak pathogenic factor weak zheng low fever hot feeling body fever however relative strength pathogenic factor zheng one factor determines intensity fever hot feeling body another factor simply constitution person person yang constitution i predominance yang prone invasions wind heat rather wind cold prone higher fever hot feeling body indeed could said constitution person main factor determines whether person falls prey invasion wind develops wind cold wind heat cold northern countries nobody
