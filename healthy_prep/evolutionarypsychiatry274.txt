i little embarrassed mark sisson got one i i sure several minions scan literature whereas i loyal friends fellow bloggers though new paper archives general psychiatry inflammation sanitation consternation loss contact coevolved tolerogenic microoganisms pathophysiology treatment major depression i admit reading mark little blurb i went paper expecting annoyed lot versions hygiene hypothesis basically idea environments clean make sound mom crazy germophobe asthma make sense remote control kid chewing billion microbes also often hear children exposed childhood infections anymore vaccines smaller family sizes antibacterial soap typical childhood infections chicken pox whooping cough diphtheria etc modern eating grains established humans developed higher population densities domesticated animals lack exposure bugs would necessarily mess evolved immune system also association evidence exposure common viruses increases inflammation may increase risk depression particular version hygiene hypothesis dealt death blow fact inner city kids rife childhood infections highest rates asthma much higher isolated rural kids living country ragweed i set aside preconceptions took look paper thank goodness i epic amazing brilliant psychiatrists psychologists doctors download access look even includes dobzhansky quote nothing biology makes sense except light evolution go i made point depression result inflammation specifically depression associated higher serum levels il nfkappabeta tnf alpha host pro inflammatory cytokines medically healthy individuals depression history early life stress mount larger inflammatory response laboratory psychosocial stressors nondepressed controls prevalence major depressive disorders increasing age cohorts especially younger people countries transitioning part developed world experience increasing rates depression along way one would hypothesize something environmental modern world makes vulnerable depression inflammatory diseases civilization ms inflammatory bowel disease type i diabetes asthma etc overwhelming data demonstrate prevalence helper cell type i mediated autoimmune inflammatory bowel th mediated allergic asthmatic conditions increased dramatically developed world th century increases immune mediated disease incidence developing world period closely paralleling adoption first world lifestyles asthma hay fever type i diabetes inflammatory bowel disease multiple sclerosis increased fold developed world last years many conditions highly comorbid major depressive disorder i focused pro inflammatory diet hypothetical cause increasing depression along obesity diseases civilization vast majority depression literature i would say focused pro inflammatory aspects stressful modern life i contend necessarily stressful life years ago years ago bubonic plague example paper focuses loss microbial modulated immunoregulation th th immune cells quick review childhood viral infections tend mobilize type i helper cells since th cells seem balance modulate th cells one might expect lack th activation due sanitized environment would lead naughty th cells running rampant causing asthma allergy like makes sense except naughty th cells seem cause autoimmune issues like crohn disease incidence crohn disease increased steadily along asthma allergy fact follow studies failed show association childhood infection increased autoimmune atopic conditions modern world continuing general find correlations first world lifestyle increases conditions humans living microorganism parasites much longer childhood infectious diseases last years agriculture ubiquitous organisms seemed keep th th cells busy without causing problems words old friends germs induced maintained adaptive level immune

plausible modern humans risk mounting inappropriate inflammatory responses leading many undesirable diseases modern civilization including depression i wonder using inappropriate food vast quantities fructose could destabilize gut microbes part inflammatory process one could postulate exposing depressed individuals old friends could treatment gut depression links already well known psychological

showed giving people prebiotic favors bifidobacteria reduced anxiety patients irritable bowel another month placebo controlled study showed lactobacillus treatment reduced anxiety depression people chronic fatigue probiotic treatment reduce depressive symptoms chronic fatigue patients another small study improve cognitive symptoms common major depressive disorder vaccae administered patients renal cell cancer reducing serum il depression symptoms another larger study killed vaccae reduced depression anxiety symptoms lung cancer patients receiving chemotherapy long way go start feeding
