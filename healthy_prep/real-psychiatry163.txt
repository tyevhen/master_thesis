antipsychotic agents used specific movement disorders worsen underlying problem primarily activity dopamine receptor one research interests atypical antipsychotics past years look property studying atypical antipsychotics parkinson patients turns one drugs worsen parkinson clozapine several target populations drug liability worsen dopamine da mediated movement disorders would useful first patients require antipsychotic medications bipolar disorder schizophrenia develop parkinson disease tardive syndromes typical atypical antipsychotic medications second group patients parkinson disease develop psychotic symptoms associated primary neurological illness groups significantly represented geriatric psychiatry practices despite widespread availability atypical antipsychotics medications last years geriatric patients bipolar disorder schizophrenia severe movement disorders usually tardive syndromes still exist medication affect da mediated locomotion system potentially great benefit
