i read article future psychiatry clinical neuroscience ross travis arbuckle jama psychiatry found little disagree i one venues years ago thomas insel director nimh talked clinical neuroscience rotation neurology neurosurgery psychiatry residents bring neuroscience clinical side things unfortunately lot less enthusiastic i sent follow mail time suggested would probably wait time future long time neuroscience enthusiast i always found reluctance head direction puzzling historical basis neuroscience always prominent role psychiatric theory one arguments neuroscience clinical applications even back day alzheimer nissl kraepelin german neuropsychiatrists studying brain anatomy patients asylums important correlations notably consistent alzheimer disease binswanger disease two decades later constantin von economo penned treatise encephalitis lethargica sequelae treatment described conditions relevant right point i started training practicing psychiatrist interest neuroscience presents variety cme events ranging behavioral neurology developmental pediatric conferences boston annual movement disorders conference aspen occasional unique courses like brain dissection course run late lennart heimer md faculty outstanding neuroanatomists neuroscience psychiatry typically packed course focuses specialized diagnosis treatment specific disorders good example would american association geriatric psychiatry aagp courses would include detailed discussion alzheimer pathology vascular dementia might disparate microscopic level also ongoing debate movement disorder

residency training programs come systematic approach training place programs post neuroscientists researchers consider top areas focus reviews mentioned narrative likely fairly complete syllabi point looking reviews academic psychiatry seem fairly disparate terms faculty see relevant vignettes prepared nimh reference illustrative possible i designing curriculum i would want every possible concept

top experts world focus suggested readings i try keep nature science neuron science signaling series cost effective approach learning new developments neuroscience whatever open access journals seem best content top journals expensive require memberships threshold set researchers teachers good general approach approach literature would useful teachers expensive journals might offer packages teachers rather researchers i recall i interviewed residency positions asked department recommended reading lists one department provided one days i let readers guess department reviewing imaging
