public radio consistent source content medical problems contain lessons everyone i happened hear one last weekend program american life story called genes make me look fatless story starts writer david epstein describing public reaction latest book sports gene part correspondence year old woman named jill viles sent illustrated letter contained heading olympic medalist muscular dystrophy patient mutation side side photos jill viles olympic sprinter priscilla lopes schliep side side web page i encourage anyone reading take look comparisons try figure ms viles came conclusion epstein interested replied getting detailed scientific brief return got second opinion geneticist consulted making book concluded ms viles probably wrong genetics story goes incredible history jill viles started research illness normal early developmental milestones started tripping falling age taken mayo clinic jill brother father tested showed evidence muscle damage concluded although looked like muscular dystrophy girls never got therefore muscular dystrophy next years arms legs got extremely thin burning sensation legs subcutaneous fat extremities disappeared leaving prominent veins within weeks started fall longer able ride bike roller skate regained ability walk began unusual research program see could find wrong started looking tales supernatural like poltergeists reasoned people books reading could explain happening might find answer went college started study medicine project involved reading textbooks journal articles muscle diseases trying find one matched experience reading article emery dreifuss muscular dystrophy noticed description popeye arms immediate association appearance father arm read description noticed features illness took number books home break father discovered muscular cardiac symptoms bradycardia beat per minute range doctors told symptoms exposure virus evaluated pacemaker placed jill went neurology clinic confirmation diagnosis neurologist make diagnosis muscular dystrophy got angry would change diagnosis writing chart rationale women get emery dreifuss muscular dystophy edmd eventually located group researchers italy specializing disorder sent blood samples entire family four years later confirmation gene single base pain mutation lamin gene according universal mutation database lmna gene known mutations variants diseases well known others point i get additional details illness clearly inspirational story jill clearly bright person transitioning explanatory paradigm went supernatural cutting edge dna genetic research within years dealing significant chronic medical problem clear diagnosis treatment astonishing testament intelligence character mental flexibility process research also made significant difference father life life olympic sprinter lopes schliep hearing speak details audio file necessary bring details life jill got job lab johns hopkins combing research reference lamin gene process came across another photo reminded appearance case prominent feature loss subcutaneous fat called partial lipodystrophy maintained also rare disorder met denials case based likelihood two rare genetically determined illnesses time believed deniers also started get increasingly anxious reading edmd short life expectancy stopped research completely started teaching local community college got married gave birth son edmd severe weakness pregnancy jill father died suddenly age gathering familiy home sister showed pictures priscilla lopes schliep noticed characteristic pattern veins muscle fibers twelve years stopped researching edmd started research lipodystrophy eventually jill arranged meeting submitted samples world expert condition dr abhimanyu garg confirmed rare type hereditary lipdystrophy turns partial lypodystrophy mutation edmd mutation lamin gene lmna jill also reached etienne lefai researcher studying srebp transcription factors control muscle mass protein synthesis overexpression factors lead muscle atrophy dr lefai credits jill changing path research reached described awesome example someone outside research community coming altering basic path research i agree completely dr lefai part story much credence give theories patients psychiatrist somewhat easier good psychotherapy depends finding underlying theories testing suggesting alternate theories times trying process sometimes patient really followed fbi figuring major decision diagnosis treatment plan i gone elaborate lengths create experiment conferenced experts fields like electrical engineering test person theory world works addiction field common encounter people never chemistry course life consider experts pharmacology organic chemistry i listen theories carefully weigh consider overall meaning interesting read experts rejected jill correct theories gradually came accept another reason post also allows me highlight i consider best resource internet musculoskeletal diseases washington

neuromuscular disease case emery dreifuss md comprehensive page genetics listed right top national organization rare diseases web page congenital lipodystrophies i often think research like i medical school wife i would head medical library i would run around pulling bound journals copied articles i needed lot heavy lifting longer necessary thanks modern flow information i thought story described
