last thursday i published information recent kennedy disease research looked promising even though verified another lab article scientists identify compound help repair toxic rna defect interesting even though i understand i asked ed resident biology professor review study comment chance ed comments different approach overstates case regard treatment various cag repeat diseases may remember generally thought symptoms kennedy disease kd cag diseases due misfolded protein cells longer ability remove proteins somehow causes cells die paper based different proposed mechanism cell death problem protein mrna make protein one needs instructions order amino acids particular protein like dictionary tells order letters word dna genes tells order amino acids protein make protein one therefore needs instructions cells get instructions looking instructions protein would look word dictionary makes copy needed instructions copy made rna known messengerrna see experiments paper based notion actually mrna somehow causing cell death resultant protein idea mutant mrna binds protein called mbnl sequestering protein ultimately leads cell death found way prevent mutant mrna bind mbnl thus indeed reason cell death block cell death btw show chemical stops cell death mrna protein interaction since generally accepted mrna fault kd really stretch call breakthrough even advancement lead treatment difficult paper nonscientists discuss suppositions generally accepted really show cell saving affects yet site forwarded seems indicate major breakthrough may know i fan publicity leads unfulfilled unrealistic hope work may end important long way helpful certainly clear press release wikipedia messenger rna mrna molecule rna encodes chemical blueprint protein product mrna transcribed dna template carries coding information sites protein synthesis ribosomes nucleic acid polymer translated polymer amino acids protein mrna dna genetic information encoded sequence nucleotides arranged codons consisting three bases codon encodes specific amino acid except stop codons terminate protein synthesis process requires two types rna transfer rna trna mediates recognition codon provides corresponding amino acid whereas ribosomal rna rrna central component ribosome protein manufacturing machinery
