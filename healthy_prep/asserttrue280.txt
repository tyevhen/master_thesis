gene misannotation huge ongoing problem biology getting better long ago december schnoes et al study called annotation error public databases misannotation molecular function enzyme superfamilies remarked manually curated database swiss prot shows lowest annotation error levels close families two protein sequence databases genbank nr trembl protein sequences kegg pathways database exhibit similar surprisingly high levels misannotation average across six superfamilies studied families examined level misannotation one databases examination nr database time shows misannotation increased types misannotation found fall several categories associated overprediction molecular function results suggest misannotation enzyme superfamilies containing multiple families catalyze different reactions larger problem recognized several important aspects problem several types gene discovery software common use strengths weaknesses little standardization output gene discovery programs widely used glimmer must trained high quality training set data order produce reliable output faulty data enters gene databases becomes part training set researchers trying train software hence error propagation major ongoing problem gene discovery programs good resolving gene overlap situations sometimes relying unsophisticated heuristics determine sense antisense strand assignment crosschecking results timeconsuming manual task rarely done entire genome public gene databases usually include scoring info rating system rates confidence level given gene function assignment issues addressed gene databases continue acquire data dubious quality leaving user double check data best confidence scoring system much needed person tell glance whether given annotation trustworthy extent ironically inability find genes underreporting results problem false positives hand big problem glimmer reportedly produces many fewer false positives previous version software probably two thirds existing public genomes annotated glimmer yet revised blast searches crosscheck gene genes limited utility since already much corrupt data public databases uncommon check gene questionable functional assignment find blast search brings back genes equally questionable functional assignments annotation software choked orthologous genes nevertheless sometimes careful examination gene relation nearby genes often share similar functionalities inspection shine dalgarno region exists inspection gc values etc help verify gene really annotation says sometimes even possible assign function gene marked hypothetical protein sort work tedious exactly sort work could crowdsourced spare time biohackers would help system place volunteers help basic sanity checking machine annotated genes would take quite army volunteers go bacterial genomes several thousand genes average already books knows maybe craig venter could organize effort make work one thing sure something improve genome annotation quality soon drowning junk annotations never mind junk dna
