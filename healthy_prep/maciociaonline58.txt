ec many manufacturers suppliers deeply concerned member state competent authorities regard products unregistered medicines since products presently sold predominantly food supplements grave risk made

recent european especially german phytopharmaceutical tradition may appreciated report uptake traditional use registration tur scheme european medicines agency ema june primarily products associated european phytopharmaceutical system successfully gaining registrations contrast single product authentic ayurvedic unani tcm tibetan thai southern african amazonian indeed non european system yet registered reasons lack uptake tur registrations among non european traditions following brief crystallisation reasons uptake among non european traditions non existent eligibility limitations four key obstacles eligibility include traditional use requirement requires least years usage within eu individual products locks many products may used decades even centuries millennia outside eu also locks modification formula might appropriate given scientific advances meet needs particular target population indications tur scheme limited minor self limiting conditions yet asian traditions cover

minor non european traditions since many traditions utilise whole plant material aqueous extracts experience considerably difficulty meeting ema guidelines pharmaceutical standards relative solvent extracted european herbal products stabilised pharmaceutical base includes synthetic polymers preservatives case majority products registered date excessive cost burden great variations registration fees charged member state competent authorities varying around per product addition often much substantial costs meeting pharmaceutical standards especially stability genotoxicity testing aware typical total cost registration single product may range upwards obstacle european phytopharmaceutical manufacturers suppliers typically narrow range products sell high volumes however significant barrier long standing non european traditions especially asian traditions suppliers often required carry range distinct products selling relatively low volumes annual revenue individual product line expected say based front registration cost would take years repay cost registration supplier sold relatively small line say traditional herbal medicines total cost registration assuming total cost registration would amount million amounts unquestionably reach small medium sized enterprises smes supplying products associated non european traditional systems lack incentive two major factors create major disincentive manufacturers non european traditional products prepare submit applications registrations tur scheme fact sme non european traditional sector assuming major technical eligibility hurdles facing complex multi ingredient non european products overcome would still able register handful products full range owing high fixed costs involved real concern given broad eu definition medicine products receiving medicinal licenses tur scheme set precedent cause member state regulators classify equivalent products also medicines already happening member states belgium uk company apply one two licenses may effectively contribute situation many products would rendered illegal understandable position standpoint many suppliers particularly borderline medicinal food products remains diffuse continue selling many herbal products possible category food functional foods food supplements effect risking huge amount money smes non european traditional sector registration scheme built around european phytopharmaceuticals non european long standing traditions generally regarded viable business option smes investing registration tur scheme viable option

concurrent french german english petitions million signatories signatories avaaz petition herbal medicines confirms highly significant measure citizen concern unfortunately european commission lacklustre performance tuesday forum european parliament done nothing suggest commission keen resolve unfolding crisis ema action plan herbal medicines addresses small number issues concern ignores many others yet implement significant proportion stated actions trying put square peg round hole thmpd enacted fully implemented st may year say years sufficient time products registered directorate general failed acknowledge registration scheme biased toward european phytopharmaceuticals entire year transition phase much widely adopted non european traditions great asian traditions ayurveda tcm

keller intimate knowledge german phytopharmaceuticals oversaw registration german national medicines law responsible role german regulatory authority bfarm experience demonstrates registration scheme favourable products non european traditions worse european pharmaceutical regulatory model increasingly alienating holistic traditions ayurveda tcm anthroposophical medicine something acknowledged final paragraph predecessor experience report seems criticism face quarters creation eu effectively european protectionist tool one favours certain products european phytopharmaceutical system discriminates non european traditional systems medicine eu attempted akin trying put square peg round hole rather trying force non european products european phytopharmaceutical model would better build regulatory system around great long standing non european traditions understand neither european commission ema ever serious getting necessary technical support china india elsewhere perhaps surprised first step acknowledging problem non european traditions years discussion member states predecessors dg enterprise apparent low level willingness deal even recognise type problems i raise letter creating efficient fair non discriminatory system regulation would neither technically legally difficult together colleagues scientists lawyers stakeholders across europe many ideas situation could remedied however i believe i would wasting time well delve detail proposals regulatory reform continue resistant significant change existing regulatory regimes facing herbal products eu light i end letter two requests could i please ask comment clarification concerns i expressed letter particular four areas i outlined claim disproportionate obstacle way products associated long standing non european compared european systems medicine respect european commission recognition inappropriate nature tur scheme holistic systems medicine stated experience report directorate general consider matter urgency feasibility new regulatory framework practice systems i greatly look forward written response two points i would like add members directorate general interested meeting experts stakeholders related non european sector discuss challenges faced possible solutions i would happy arrange mutually convenient time place sincerely robert verkerk
