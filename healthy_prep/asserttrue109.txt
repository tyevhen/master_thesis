polyanna triumphalism comeback new jobs open rings hollow face kind epic disruption ford model workers skilled artisans de skilling important consequence industrial revolution frey osborne correctly note one main consequences introduction technology duing original industrial revolution de skilling jobs manufacturing operations previously required highly skilled artisans reduced menial assembly line work refactoring labor take place next phase technological revolution result wholesale job loss merely de skilling also see new round de skilling happening good jobs get replaced crapified low tech work according recent news story mid wage high wage jobs accounted jobs lost recession august represented created recovery gap filled low wage jobs jobs lost recession making less hour make majority new jobs created recovery piketty makes reference surprising since story century book twenty first century title maybe piketty knows something i wish tell tired lies half truths mental
