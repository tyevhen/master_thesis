i washed hands times yesterday used disinfectant hand cleaner least times i immediate access water soap hand washing technique validated infection control nurse trained monitor appropriate hand washing i also wiped table office chair times disinfectant wipes i careful touch food face i air cleaner running office pm uv lamp designed kill viruses despite i day flu like illness cough myalgias fatigue fever i obsessive compulsive disorder i live minnesota peak season annual influenza epidemic i actually take precautions flu season i avoid public i used belong gym set basement i could workout routine home exercise equipment known reservoir viruses bacteria i also gym sounded like hospital ward due hacking coughing i avoid movie theaters reason i rituals past twenty years initially i thought i allergic influenza vaccine want catch flu i fairly successful avoiding flu successful avoiding practically every respiratory virus twenty three years i worked old building designed contain heat rather clear respiratory viruses environment virus introduced predictable epidemic sometimes within days affecting entire staff modern employment disincentives finite paid time sick time system keeps ill people working would rather work lose vacation time keeps epidemic going throughout flu season people risk told things wash hands cough sleeve stay home ill get flu shot unfortunately measures enough prevent infection airborne viruses face masks help study college dormitory dwellers showed hand washing wearing mask well wearing mask offered protection influenza like illness relative control group used term modest i would call difference infection rates weak best study looked three groups students college dormitories groups attack rates flu like illness fli included controls intervention face mask face mask hand hygiene authors tried control many measures possible lot reasons experimenting college students problematic terms basic methods hand washing use hand disinfectants considered small significant effect transmission respiratory viruses effectiveness masks depends fit mask physical characteristics environment virus one study showed tightly sealed respiratory mask would block influenza virus poorly fitting mask blocked virus process creating infectious droplets interesting physical process current estimates show normal breathing minutes creates droplets process atomization single strong nasal expiration results hundreds droplets diameter counting loudly creates hundred droplets range single cough produces thousand single sneeze produces hundred thousands million droplets contain viral particles video happens millions sneeze generated particle airplane might good place wear mask assumes sneeze atomization also occur vomit viral
