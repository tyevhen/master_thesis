hearing medical model used used pejoratively quite tiresome i heard used way past thirty years usually take shot psychiatrists i thought i would illustrate goes i disagree responding recent article authored british psychological society system care psychotic disorders changed interest provoking argument since i think errors obvious target audience also relevant described service users friends families journalists policymakers mental health workers public really political document similar nature documents generated samhsa treatment guidelines generated special interest groups like managed care companies case i spend time technical aspects psychosis alluded paper political document requires active refutation suggestions might adapted wholesale measures i know british psychiatry successful american counterparts judging i read editorials i doubt let me start couple authors statements medical model least uk mental health services currently based medical model assumption experiences hearing voices indicate illness result sort problem brain p idea also enshrined mental health law basis compulsion past many professionals also believed people experiencing distressing voices paranoia unlikely recover without treatment usually medication belief led perceived duty care provide treatment tendency view someone want treatment offered lacking insight report shown assumptions unfounded p reference past services based might called paternalistic approach idea professionals know best job give advice patient role obey advice compliance needs change rather giving advice work services think collaborators people trying help p reference authors definition medical model looks three dimensions first assumption psychotic experiences due brain problem partially true limit describe idiopathic causes psychosis ignore specific psychotic states etiological factors also exclude medical illnesses clearly associated psychotic symptoms happens area psychiatrists trained recognize treat trivializing psychiatric diagnosis list symptoms clinicians refer anyway certainly consistent authors main points contention fortunately reality finally diagnostic manual criticize numerous categories researched strictly psychotic disorders anxiety mood disorders caused social etiologies rather brain problems per se early career i reviewed predominately scandinavian literature brief psychoses brief reactive psychoses i could provide necessary prognostic information patients families clear evidence significant psychotic symptoms spontaneously remit without medical intervention information critical part medical approach spontaneously remitting illness secondly go say also means professionals believe people unable recover without treatment i know professionals psychiatrists since time kraepelin known people recover without treatment although kraepelin day considered asylum care alone treatment like many illnesses people recover without treatment literature brief psychosis evidence psychiatrists also known specific types psychosis catatonia example grim prognoses without treatment earliest studies showed malignant catatonia mortality rate turn th century turn th century mortality rate approaches less modern treatment second part definition clearly wrong finally authors use paternalism characterize role physicians charge frequently accompanies called medical model often amidst associated charge authoritarianism also incorrect medicine based informed consent model care psychiatrist aware physicians informed consent based idea patient provided adequate information make risk benefit decision patient physician collaborate patient decision i conversations every day many times day nothing referred somewhere else denied agreed upon care managed care company additional possibilities conversations occur patients actively bleeding floor refuse allow trauma surgeon intervene due impaired judgment psychosis particular situation surgeons likely remind anyone involved care would assaulting patient intervened informed consent similar situations occur people various forms treatable life threatening illnesses operable cancer impending paralysis uncontrolled diabetes mellitus etc unable make decisions best interest due effects psychosis authors definition medical model wrong dimensions good starting point proposal go beyond outmoded medical model always good know model really declaring outmoded i think lack scholarship experience matters common characteristic people criticize medical model psychiatry course generally scholarly endeavor anyone interested educating real medical model might look like i would suggest reading systematic psychiatric evaluation reference guide psychiatric evaluation take look appendix quick story fact models like one widely emulated nonphysicians may speak utility understanding treating psychosis mental disorders authors characterization psychosis seem touch high spots mention hallucinations delusions formal thought disorder obviously heavy phenomena would typically come attention psychiatrists people experience hallucinations delusions grey zone phenomena quite psychotic symptoms central feature psychosis generally comes attention psychiatrists ones within medical model turns authors little say judgment insight nothing say conscious state individual distressing often life threatening aspects illness aspect psychotic illness causes friends family state longer recognize person due disruption personality characteristics really believe psychiatrists casual conversations people intellectually curious bothered hallucinations delusions really believe affected person may experienced profound change conscious state makes unrecognizable friends family unable work perform basic life activities really believe change conscious state may possibly represent acute danger person affected loved ones people seriously affected psychotic states people responsible assessing treating states make statements people generally need see psychiatrists authors claim lack insight result person detained mental illness happen i practice i document behavioral evidence rather lack insight treatment refusal also used basis detaining someone usa strong financial incentive discharge people hospitals soon possible businesses governments manage facilities welcome treatment refusals patient discharged immediately follow demands business perspective cost effective care paternalism exists societal level society proper arbiter vulnerable citizens treated forced treatment allowed die rights psychiatrists choice follow society lead psychiatrists vested interest forced treatment one critical questions exists first place obvious answer far perfect approach help families get loved ones treated even families routinely disappointed hospitals courts still interpretations laws save money provide necessary treatment end still medical paternalism two sections paper merit commentary dangerousness etiologies psychosis selective inaccurate characterization psychiatric assessment authors drop bomb psychologists reaching conclusion psychosis often less natural reaction traumatic events example one recent paper suggested growing evidence experiences service users report many cases natural reaction abuses subjected abuse effects abuse additional psychosis needs explaining p reference interesting observation psychiatrists screen new evaluations trauma history post traumatic stress disorder ptsd instead recent paper i psychiatrist seeing new cases per year i screen everybody i see psychosis ptsd childhood adversity forms psychological trauma space years new evaluations i observe patients significant childhood adversity psychological trauma ptsd related trauma psychotic symptoms totally unrelated previous trauma i pose hypothetical would common experience psychiatrists issue trauma cause symptoms also lead examinations previous errors postulating trauma etiology symptoms notably multiple personality disorder mpd fiasco associated phenomenon satanic ritualistic abuse sra i would recommend even using highly qualified statements possible etiology psychosis without ample evidence although research bias frequent accusation area psychopharmacology research reason suspect favorite theories psychosocial research less bias producing authors fall back statement mental illnesses implying dangerousness vast majority cases true also true population significant illnesses need evaluated suicidal aggressive behavior tragedies occur result impaired judgment altered conscious states psychotic disorders commonplace people problems successfully treated violence suicide prevented enough suggest people mental illnesses may stigmatized connection violence people psychotic disorders aggression among stigmatized people society solution deny problem exists identify treatable problem develop appropriate public health response also strong bias american legal system punish rather treat anyone psychosis commits crime escaping punishment result guilty reason insanity defense ngri one consistent urban legends america defense hardly ever success even likely patient involved spend time forensic prison hospital would criminally sentenced without ngri defense authors certainly wrong medical model psychosis mental disorders i used seeing medical
