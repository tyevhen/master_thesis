reader several possible points differential diagnosis including depression bipolar disorder also hypersomnia nos obstructive sleep apnea disorder substance abuse problem i may typical psychiatrist bits information i would speculating substance abuse problem would know make hypersomnia nos differential diagnosis i would also building tree structure parallel differential diagnoses mind like experts i found best way proceed move form one clump data next go exhaustive checklist series parallel considerations property expert diagnosticians pattern matching ability pattern matching consists rapid recognition diagnostic features based past experience matching cases treatments outcomes pattern matching also leads rapid rule outs based incongruous features like allegedly manic patient aphasia rather formal thought disorder i see pattern looks like may bipolar disorder feature i immediately hone whether patient ever manic episode true whether tell me diagnosis bipolar disorder i looking plausible description manic episode less cued description better i seen evaluations cases say patient meet criteria bipolar disorder i really care whether specific dsm criteria asked whether
