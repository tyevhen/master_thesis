thyroid one glands hooked everything mood cognition metabolism bones heart cholesterol affected perturbations among thyroid hormones chris kresser done great series articles worth look unfamiliar thyroid want comprehensive refresher fact good job seems hardly worth reinventing wheel i thought i would start psychiatric disease address questions chase rabbit holes inevitably open information today comes review done american journal psychiatry month pointed me fantastic colleague dr hale abnormal thyroid function tests psychiatric patients red herring review conventional extreme i find often useful start conventional reasoning pick apart may issues something missing i begin briefest primers less page killers things i done right click open new tab right everything endocrine feedback loop purposes start hypothalamus makes chemical called thyrotropin releasing hormone trh chemical toodles anterior pituitary produces thyroid stimulating hormone tsh tsh directs thyroid gland release thyroid hormone two major ones triiodothyronine thyroxine high levels feedback pituitary cause decrease amount tsh secreted thus nicely regulating important thing know iodine essential creation thyroid hormones actually prohormone major hormone secreted thyroid active hormone selenium required turn courtesy wikipedia commons lots things go wrong within complex system example nodule thyroid start producing thyroid hormone like gangbusters wo respond feedback inhibition hyperthyroidism classic lab results high high typically undetectable tsh symptoms racy metabolism weight loss rapid heartbeat somewhat elevated body temperature insomnia anxiety etc opposite case thyroid stop responding pituitary tsh stimulation stop producing thyroid hormone known hypothyroidism result low high tsh symptoms include weight gain fatigue depression cold intolerance hair loss slow heart rate among others two primary thyroid disorders cause host psychiatric symptoms including depression mania dementia even psychosis someone comes office weight gain cold intolerance fatigue depression i better well check thyroid grab pulse rate i i look pretty silly treating hypothyroidism therapy antidepressants besides basic thyroid problems thyroid hormones kilter variety ways chris kresser series goes great detail rare exceptions abnormalities due thyroid problems actual gland alterations thyroid function occur response sorts systemic illnesses stress states medications perturbations thyroid function tests thought due actual hypo hyperthyroidism called nonthyroidal illness general pattern tests quite fit classic hypo hyperthyroid patterns indicate nonthyroidal illness sepsis heart attack major surgery autoimmune disease lead characteristic pattern thyroid tests including low normal low high reverse tsh often normal low later become elevated recovery abnormalities extremely common seen hospitalized medical patients kicker abnormalities seem physiologic response illness resolve without intervention months reason changes happen always complicated inflammatory cytokines il il tnf alpha likely involved altering feedback regulation along hypothalamic pituitary thyroid axis starvation fasting low carb diet tend lead low tsh normal slightly elevated free low nothing wrong thyroid hypothyroidism per se normal physiologic response perceived starvation resolve without intervention someone stops fasting increases carbohydrate intake sepsis severe infection often present low tsh normal free low free similar pattern infection cleared abnormalities resolve low syndrome bad predictor case cardiovascular disease mean treating would smart reason suspect low may maladaptive response heart attack may good idea i think proof future research noted primary thyroid problems cause psychiatric symptoms however reverse also true psychiatric inpatients abnormal thyroid tests case medical nonthyroidal illness abnormalities tend characteristic disorder also resolve within months acute psychosis example tsh usually normal total often elevated mania total free elevated depression tsh may little low high high free low high total general recommended nonthyroidal illness treated thyroid hormone nonthyroidal illness low abnormality may part adaptive inflammatory response i linked thoughts possible exceptions reasoning conventional medicine suggests testing tsh alone checking hormone levels tsh whack without multiple findings indicative thyroid problems typical hyper hypothyroid symptom complex unlikely primary thyroid issue except elderly sometimes show symptoms folks history family history autoimmune disease treatment lithium radiation exposure goiter etc obviously higher risk primary thyroid disease one higher suspicion subclinical hypothyroidism bit gray area true thyroid illness nonthyroidal problems tsh high free low normal usually multiple hypothyroid symptoms indicate thyroid problem symptoms indicate nonthyroidal illness resolve show serial lab tests months perspective physician i tend rely tsh aggressively pursue mildly abnormal ts ts particularly symptoms however i think low grade iodine selenium deficiencies rarely thought conventional physician may lead thyroid symptoms subclinical confusing lab results eating much millet typical question standard medical interview addition controversy appropriate range tsh considered normal past around many labs narrowed threshold reducing upper limit however true hyperthyroidism much question tsh undetectable true hypothyroidism unusual see levels higher tsh levels associated greater risk cardiovascular disease due factors systemic inflammation make sense use thyroid hormone treat mere number different treating cholesterol number medicine specific purpose getting number better range i think still coming consensus right thing case subclinical hypothyroidism discussed comments previous post psychiatry pretty much specialty large amount data clinical reason using hormone treat depression symptoms primary care doctors endocrinologists use exclusively general prohormone safer body able make much needs provided selenium levels vitamin levels okay conversely aggressive lead death however i noted i found generally ineffective uncomfortable folks seem respond well already diagnosed hypothyroidism synthetic i also found recommended psychiatry doses mcg way high lead mild hyperthyroidism symptoms within several months i better luck lower doses around mcg combined lowering dose anecdotes hardly data i think i might caught poor converters maybe selenium deficient conventional endocrinology folks really exist i usually able get away treatment i document psychiatric indication
