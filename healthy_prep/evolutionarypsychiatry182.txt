last week i introduced new diet dementia paper part i presented results fumbled around interpretation quite know make given lack details actual diets paper i contacted researchers kind enough fact kind emails send me bit information methods sample daily diet i fumble around let start big picture context i tend forget sometimes thoughtful well meaning people still believe animal fat bad simple carbs bad eating cardboard er i mean fiber rich foods skim milk olive oil moderation skinless chicken breasts i also perhaps little comfortable fact thoughtful well meaning people view think view animal fat good macronutrients important think absent insulin resistance issues dementia case eating fat lunacy i mean kids get whole milk yogurt still two age fat becomes bad according usda okay i stop capital letters part reason i comfortable thought lunatic i think people secretly believe psychiatrists lunatics anyway almost always bit double take i tell people profession medical circles i get oh one sort look among lay folk party example people suddenly clam begin telling me life stories different psychiatric medicines tried psychiatrists bit puzzle anyway i think psychiatrists thusly look big complex puzzles comprised experience world view psychology environment biology try figure help someone typically presenting emotional issues though day age could anything manage factors could contributing problem holistic view problem solving health problems makes psychiatrist somewhat uniquely suited examining evolutionary medicine perhaps bias speaking bias week i read great interest always paul shou ching jaminet perfect health diet blog particularly blood lipids infectious disease part comments i linked commentary study cholesterol cause mortality honolulu lancet money quote sir central surprising finding study low serum cholesterol persisting years increased subsequent cause mortality logical explanation finding apparently correspondents graph data another money quote author letter replying commentary findings agree association low cholesterol mortality sorry cuchel rader infer causal relation since intent yes correlation merely correlation correlations always pretty darn consistent recent phd post links studies showing correlation especially true elderly important put thinking caps try figure correlatively speaking higher cholesterol seem killing people fast low cholesterol despite fact health minded people busy eating good diets taking meds lower cholesterol generation instead putting thinking caps researchers lancet conclude logical explanation timidly suggest elderly treated quite aggressively cholesterol lowering medications nice conservative fine sentence thought cholesterol might good since bodies go trouble make might go proving causality correlations world view conventional nutritional researcher firmly mind let go back look diet dementia paper actual diets reminder study healthy older adults mean age adults mild cognitive impairment mean age put low low fat low glycemic carbohydrate diet high high fat high saturated fat high glycemic carbohydrate diet weeks number biomarkers related cholesterol dementia measured researchers felt came clear win low diet i listed results previous post i think interesting finding paper mild cognitive impairment patients responded quite differently typically extreme fluctuations biomarkers sometimes opposite trends dietary changes healthy controls simplicity sake i focus mild cognitive impairment patients post first details diets told macronutrient ratios fact food delivered twice weekly participants question researchers would able specific diets example high diet carbohydrate primarily sugar starch foods heavily processed example equivalent jenny craig meals delivered twice weekly whole foods saturated fats animal fats trans fats coconut palm oil initial reply high diet carbohydrates combination sugars starches foods processed many saturated fats primarily animal derived researcher nutritionist study helpfully took time day send me sample day menu methods please see attached copy sample day diet keep participants blinded possible deliberately included food items diets seemed healthy unhealthy menus low diet breakfast egg white lowfat cheese sprouted wheat english muffin fruit cocktail canned juice snack lowfat fruit yogurt whole grain granola lunch grilled low fat mozzarella tomato basil sandwich sourdough bread beef barley soup peanut ms snack whole grain chex raisins cashews chocolate chips dinner roasted pork tenderloin roasted apples onions bulgur wheat apricots almonds green beans snack blueberry crisp lowfat whipped topping high diet breakfast buckwheat pancakes butter sugar free syrup milk snack whole milk mozzarella cheese saltine crackers lunch grilled turkey cheddar white bread cream tomato soup snack honey roasted chex mix dinner beef stroganoff rice noodles broccoli butter snack nilla wafers vanilla ice cream okay paleo perspective difference i see two diets neither i would eat personally indeed simple starches sugars high diet animal fat high diet butter milk fat cream diets chock full grains i would consider industrially processed food rather whole foods i would knock high diet sugar refined flour sugar free syrup i would knock low diet use fake fats lowfat whipped topping grains i could see could toxic delicate physiology mind let take another look biomarker changes interpretations cognitively impaired patients four weeks diet high diet increased insulin resistance low diet decreased high diet fat saturated fat high glycemic carbohydrates compared low diet fat saturated fat carbohydrate i sure make finding positive side low diet eating cardboard less sugar increased insulin sensitivity another interpretation lowering carbs high diet increased physiologic insulin resistance certainly low carb diet means high diet ldl increased points mci patients low diet dropped points modern nutritional researchers would call finding clear win low diet keeping mind physiologic findings dementia perspective insight stephanie seneff however i sure dementia lower lipid levels found spinal fluid compared non demented controls me jump ldl actually much higher jump healthy controls could mci patients way trying make animal fat getting desperately needed saturated fat fat soluble vitamins coq cholesterol besieged brain everyone knows i psychiatrist i must lunatic low diet hdl went points mci patients high diet went points everyone would agree likely win high diet i consider hdl marker rapid cholesterol fat turnover i would consider good less old rotten oxidized fats floating around better get specific biomarkers dementia get confusing picture comparing mci patients controls markers went controls researchers considered bad mci patients researchers also considered bad reasoning followed inflection point model people developing dementia increasing levels certain biomarkers point dementia inevitable point levels biomarkers begin drop dementia progresses therefore increasing level healthy control would bad bringing closer point return increasing level dementia patient would good bringing back closer inflection point closer health ldl good example ldl levels tend higher carriers apoe risky genotype developing alzheimer dr bg done great posts recently ldl levels tend drop dementia develops i think higher ldl might representative brain body best fill brain yummy delicious brain fat nutrients conventional sphere since high ldl bad high ldl must part pathologic process destroying brain probably inflammation though i sold reasonable physiologic method higher sat fat could cause inflammation lipotoxicity seems depend hyperglycemia conventional wisdom explanation lipids drop prior development dementia considered reasonable give someone dementia statins i think bit lunacy i lunatic never forget back paper apoe levels go high diet increased low diet mci folks would fit model apoe takes cholesterol brain aggressive scavenging cholesterol low fat diet researchers believe cholesterol goes circulation brain link papers view senoff believes differently links papers describes mechanism apoe helps astrocytes escort ldl circulation across blood brain barrier given autopsy studies show cholesterol levels csf similar circulation seems logical two systems ways communicating equalizing well let separate sets researchers duke one low diet amyloid levels went high diet stayed i think win fat researchers interpreted differently one markers related inflection point went far explain biomarker high diets probably could damage already extant process brain whereas controls amyloid went high diet high diet clearly damaging f isoprostanes derived omega fats marker inflammation decreased low diet stayed high diet mci folks high diet increased f isoprostanes controls since fat diet designed nutritionist probably omega fat diet knows fat saturated fat diet sat fat maybe wash depends much mono ate also sugar high diet i even know look inflammation diets mean i see biases knowledge base evidence showing increasing fat diets mci patients probably good idea though i see diets could inflammatory damaging i would personally pick either researchers biases knowledge base feel high diet disaster study presents strong preliminary evidence low diet preferable everyone mci patients controls researchers phds nutrition i clinical psychiatrist hobby oh wait i professional nutrition writer i keep forgetting decide want believe
