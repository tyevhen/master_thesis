review systems psychiatry changed significantly years changes due billing coding decisions rather clinical utility practicing long enough witnessed transformation document similar primary care physicians use one focused sleep appetite disturbances associated psychiatric disorders results distinctly different ros psychiatry rest medicine puts medically based psychiatrists like myself disadvantage electronic health record ehr templates may include physical symptoms i interested requires documentation changes unique psychiatry patients find filling checklists many clinics essentially surrogate ros something physician used ask person ask elaborate checklist modern ehr ros often series checkboxes elaboration required thank form fill waiting area incorporated physician note often without reviewing patient systems employing scribes persons documentation scribe type dictate form record one additional point physician might read ros incorporated way read final note signing review usually cursory time constraints i doubt read regularity enough time read documentation times complied transcribed entered ehr another ehr strategy used time time statement complete point review systems done negative use statement depends billing coding compliance staff whether think meets subjective standards day demonstrate somebody work done experience unless interviewing healthy year old unlikely ros completely negative expanded ros specific medicine assumes physician asking clarificatory questions i found years basic structured exercise like ros produces different results depending asking questions asking clarificatory questions pursuing obvious leads sets questions depending patient response treating ros like static series yes questions likely produce minimum amount diagnostic information example consider following example ros conducted year old man seen insomnia taking medical history says diagnosed congestive heart failure years earlier impaired physical performance due chf walk feet slowly climb flight stairs great effort ros endorses needing prop breathe occasionally wakes suddenly night doe shortness breath symptoms additional physical exam findings suggest chf problem rather insomnia treatment needs change accordingly common example ros conducted year old man denies cardiac pulmonary symptoms taking mg aspirin addition two different antidepressants year history smoking pack day cigarettes interviewer asks ever stress test patient states know walk treadmill keep increasing grade stop patient replies took test cardiologist came sprayed something mouth think nitroglycerin spray patient states immediate angiography stent placement examples illustrate ros dynamic static filling waiting room may seem efficient amount information obtained setting likely low relative real medical problems exist probability increased information dynamic ros increases age patient due accumulated medical problems age addition list symptoms ros additional heuristics level pathological mechanisms considered hone specific syndrome following table illustrates two example general category ros generally implies kind infectious metabolic endocrine condition enough make actual diagnosis without delineation ros categories supposed roughly correlate body systems rather pathological mechanisms many symptoms definable body system vindicate vitamin v vascular i inflammatory neoplastic degenerative deficiency i idiopathic intoxication congenital autoimmune allergic traumatic endocrine v vascular i inflammatory trauma autoimmune metabolic i iatrogenic neoplasm degenerative i think patient flu like illness i ask specific symptoms flu like illness addition fatigue weight change fever chills i might ask malaise cough rhinorrhea nasal congestion headache sore throat myalgias chills sneezing positives several symptoms greatly increases likelihood diagnosis flu like illness asking questions occurs infectious etiology suspected typical review systems i used years printed red highlights additional points i ask markers initial history suggests might positive example i seeing year old long history stimulant use three different antihypertensives anti arrhythmic medication i generally ask cardiopulmonary symptoms additional questions cardiac testing imaging diagnoses example mentioned never heart attack stroke doctor every

i frequently gotten past medical history section inquired major surgical medical diagnoses past result surprisingly thin specific prompting diagnoses physicians patient seen past produce much information interview setting psychiatric purposes ros also included follow visits seems necessary i find useful documenting intercurrent illnesses medical side effects class psychiatric medications relevant ros recalled practice i might try type point time tonight main point ros function beyond psychiatric history psychiatrists people tend view difference necessary one billing code another i see opportunity figure really going medically patient possibly diagnose another illness george dawson md dfapa ros files download ros files used post following links word documents suggestions
