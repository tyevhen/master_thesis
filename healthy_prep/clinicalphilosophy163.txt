something i anything others able see i know feeling feeling call largely belief see feeling belief i really uh feel i describe feeling yes feel believe believed example really believed fine person spite mistakes made may still make life spite anyone else parents thinking fine really believed would feel fundamentally rotten oh hmm i guess right i guess i feel way however logical error seems ellis rather patient ellis appears assuming since i unlikely feel rotten myself i truly believe i good fine person must case feeling rotten myself product believing myself rotten might ask start idea beliefs often products feelings rather vice versa might expect arrive state affairs say i felt really felt good myself may i consequence disposed form positive beliefs myself might also true sometimes people feel something rotten without formed associated belief say phobic person may find feeling scared spiders birds without believing way dangerous may hard imagine truly believing one fine person whilst also feeling one rotten may reflect nothing powerfully constraining impact feelings belief formation furthermore may many cases feeling belief indistinguishable certain patients may defend painful emotions couching self talk non affective idioms sticking believe think etc lead overlook sometimes genuinely interchangeable roles feel believe may occupy also forget uses feel function precisely draw contrast believe know i feel lucky today although i believe luck i know right i still feel hurt one way cbt theorist might try salvage idea maladaptive beliefs drive emotional

professional duty communicate clearly accurately psychologists misusing ordinary terms belief thought may less unhelpful deploying language science adds nothing better stated everyday language fact
