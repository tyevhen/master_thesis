chapter darian leader rather interesting new book psychosis begins kind explanation feelings influence schizophrenia explanation seems me paradigm stretch reasoning i unlike presumably author yet recognise i know document goes leader interested feeling belief schizophrenia intentions thoughts others enter one mind body controlling one mind without suggests identity partly constituted acts refusal rejecting food assert desires language however learned language internalised language call 'thought also derived mainly parents must take i internalise knowledge word meaning order express therefore assert i sure make refuse say certain words also learn variety actions observation also verbally subvert parental order meaning importantly children often say 'no using language learned parent refuse parent entreaty contrast saying clear me honestly i see one rate leader cites freud tausk experience influence schizophrenia freud says 'the 'infant conception others knew thoughts source process learning speak obtained language others infant also received thoughts child feeling others know thoughts well others made language along thoughts therefore basis reality schizophrenic woman said younger father could hear thoughts quite rightly took away p first i sure trying explain delusions thought insertion thought control mind reading freud quote leader rider seem match second i yet see legitimate inference 'obtaining language others idea 'receiving thoughts i assuming motor commands others sure 'receive sorts thoughts others listen thoughts express talk furthermore may pick consciously otherwise variety perspectives implicitly immanent within talk explicitly avowed also extent language vehicle thought learn language others develop capacity thoughts learning language others fairly obvious none meant schizophrenic subject complaining 'made 'passivity actions impulses feelings complaining able understand people influenced propaganda others complaining living experience others directly affect initiation direction feelings thoughts behaviours contra freud i still believe obvious 'basis reality phenomenon question reflecting way learn language seem even begin help understand made phenomena leader freud offer reflections addressing precisely issue leader writes 'as schizophrenic woman said father could hear thoughts took away earth 'as come sentence kind exemplification gone i stuck text offering me sentences form thoughts i see receive thoughts let mind begin influenced normal sense terms i left conclude passes thinking someone else passes thinking amongst myself i suspect trained me me leader conflated associative word picturing generation thoughts exceedingly ungenerous me i yet know else writes leader goes describe children may often think parents know think without telling hence importance learning lie cf winnicott described leader escaping parents dominion 'in schizophrenia however dominion always broken affect body mind p well yes offered regression hypothesis without independent evidence regression idea maturation schizophrenic adolescent till breakdown pseudo maturation leader goes 'this apparent absence schizophrenic experiencing plaything powerful linked question language question leader mind left unarticulated schizophrenia permeability language words images direct effect schizophrenic subjects obey command suggestion coming outside one reason often seems childhoods happy uneventful words followed like instructions p examples suggestibility given curious feature leader text i beginning notice fact say instructions verbal taken mean linguistic nature significant occurrence accordingly feature explanations leader says 'in schizophrenia permeability language words images direct effect appears me talking kind command automatisms one may sometimes find schizophrenia well me strange way putting matters 'permeability language way articulating makes one think something subject relationship language gone awry true rather fact people seem lost capacity self initiated action instead may follow instructions others without thinking describing 'permeability language simply far general vague count me elucidatory reference another example 'if symbolic separated child mother remain included one patient expressed 'i look arms mine move without direction somebody else moves limbs thoughts attached strings strings pulled others p i think happening vague descriptions one hand vagueness defeats possibility genuine explanation hand vague eliding language even seem explanation leader tying together admittedly intriguing way child initial partial un differentiation parents schizophrenic experience invaded need actually know given details tying together supposed work child normally described suffering passivity experiences schizophrenic typically experiences parents invasive forces instead 'somebody else moves limbs thoughts nobody ever doubted schizophrenic cases transitivistic phenomena phenomena described disturbance ego boundaries development ego boundaries core task childhood adolescence etc find schizophrenia simple failure differentiation actual experience invasion precisely 'ego boundary place boundary experience transgressed alien located inside body precisely need explaining 'failure differentiation mother seems me explanatory job proffered need hedge explaining functioned non transitivistically pre psychotic also need supplement explaining fact simple absence weakness boundary delusional experience impossibly actually represented within one sensori motor domain leader writes child body payed lot attention caregiver young 'both external internal processes linked p ok vague 'linked etc lets go 'the sensation hunger example inseparable caregiver hungry food fed ok good example makes less vague 'the thus intimately linked actual body inner outer happens inside depends fact must special importance schizophrenia due bizarre bodily sensations find also ascription feelings external influence p whoa connection waiting explained must fact special importance might passivity experiences different origin neurological disturbance child experiences hunger 'links caregiver lack care anything schizophrenic person experiencing invasion another person internal world way i make work i take 'internal world 'linked one sense take another sense make pseudo inference i switch senses terms half way discussion postscript i noticed something extraordinary way leader text fascinates frustrates me frustration consists way language used i find vague genuinely communicative way thoughts theories presented i ca recognise i feel like i caught shadow boxing certain moves made normal connections words world often happening leader genuinely interesting things say really need psychoanalytic accounts psychosis supplement challenge uk least far readily available freudian kleinian options freeman bion segal jackson lucas etc feeling i yet trust something leader working meaning oedipus complex genuinely contribute different understanding psychotic conditions i write text though i find myself getting cross often go back posts later edit frustrated jabs jibes get past censor first second pass sets me task postings try achieve greater degree measured owning feelings open mindedness
