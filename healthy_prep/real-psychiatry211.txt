i got mail young electrical engineer day interested psychiatry asked me ideas increase exposure process talking patients interested experience considering change medical school psychiatry i thought today brought back memories science math majors discriminated times medical school admissions process back day i initially considering application medical schools general knowledge section mcat medical college admissions test purportedly select people well rounded science majors shoulder wheel studying math science well rounded seemed mean liberal arts majors people broad exposure art galleries museums theatre culture general couple things wrong theory first biased test toward anyone lived major city hayseed like me made school trip guthrie theatre minneapolis exactly high school career everything else better paying close attention happened english literature class dynamic approach learning contrast experience friend mine new york born raised internist broad experience forms art including opera ballet high school one brilliant people i ever met comes discussing critiquing art forms likely originating childhood adolescence steeped artistic milieu new york city i know learn medical school think would better old general knowledge test second problem general assumption people involved humanities likely interested people take humanistic approach medicine seems bit loose connection temperament personality intellectual pursuits people hard sciences must rigid lack warmth oblivious human condition lack empathy right i never found solid evidence support i concede communications majors outstanding job weddings i recall going wedding i knew groom since infant grabbed microphone launched minute impromptu i asked came answer communications major apart i asked many good psychiatrists major undergrad surprising number chemistry majors chemistry majors defects physicians psychiatrists well anyone else i glad field far i tell previous bias science majors getting medical school rational basis i ca certain whether exists today i sure administrators keep manipulating entrance exam commentary couple years ago i point stated goals aspiring think like scientist probably congruent senior level science major i think translate admissions bias favor science majors reasons encourage engineering math science majors go medicine psychiatry i think definitely highest levels technical aspects brain science exploding future physicians psychiatrists grounding scientific thought information science able make best use clinically research level medicine currently throes crude clinical trials often limited lack specificity medications prescribed limited efficacy significant side effects means medical side physicians forseeable future managing medications side effects i think dimensional comparisons across medicine science engineering may useful economics physicians currently overworked much work little patient care practically people managing physicians right dilbert cartoon medicine reduced rapid prescribing paradigm businesses recruiting non physicians already led reduction quality care psychiatry largely eliminating psychotherapy time spent individual patients systems considerations care engineering particular may financially sound career opportunity escape fate dilbert economics consideration i recently encountered young petroleum engineer involved oil exploration successful decided go medicine i asked motivation said wanted work help people even meant significant hit salary autonomy intellectual satisfaction scientific endeavors especially business level produce clear measurable results process frequently incorporates theory learned along way engineer medicine psychiatry much diffuse administrators politicians ordering around mantle science clearly know nothing may find colleagues really interested cerebral aspects field practical medicine psychiatry stultifying realize involves series political arguments conflict interest drug trials conflict interest medicine psychiatry attack time people believe contact private industry least level reimbursement work done payments private industry need reported national database needless say discourages physicians working pharmaceutical medical device industry significant difference engineering example i contacted ieee asked policy standards told encourage participation industry discussion standards expertise distributed within industry need active discussions medicine psychiatry largely due questionable theory industry affect treatment decisions embarked period isolation medical industries may alien technical fields especially engineers politics year period unprecedented discrimination physicians state federal governments like american politics implicit goal seems bring physicians management companies proxies governments face strategy highly successful practically physicians employees large health care companies supervised people know practically nothing work quite content tell many policies like recertification significant impact physicians families conducive idyllic balanced lifestyle subjectivity uncertainty high degree subjectivity medicine many circles considered dirty word non physicians fail see importance subjectivity relates information transfer biological systems least creative try pretend exist try reduce everything point scale mistake scales objectivity sort measurement really understand scientific measurement base entire systems care failed measurement systems ca reasoned large proliferation measurements quasi scientific best used assess physicians processes frequently meaningless data collected used make decisions care systems care operate physicians settings knowledge science measurement frustrated people i posts interpersonal dimension treating people psychiatrist rigorous interpersonal landscape physicians psychiatrists treat broad spectrum problems cases significant conflicts people trying help based underlying mental illness conflicts affect physicians others may already able tolerate interpersonal conflicts better peers may make psychiatry easier psychiatrists also unique medical speciality groups people dislike routinely disparage whenever chance able tolerate also make easier go psychiatry issues consider thinking switching careers going medicine psychiatry medicine psychiatry sciences need scientists engineers mathematicians make good doctors i hoping help medicine move morass political regulation business theories back toward light time fair consider engineering may possible find better work environment better lifestyle intellectual stimulation better reimbursement i think tonight science engineering student additional questions please feel free post i try answer specifics please see disclaimer george dawson md dfapa supplementary mail i received suggested i electrical engineer i electrical engineer major biology chemistry i member ieee largely though work number electrical engineers electroencephalgraphy i ieee member years
