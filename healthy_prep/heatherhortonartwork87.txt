dwell among beauties mysteries earth never alone weary life rachel carlson last morning wrangell st elias national park alaska michael i knew get organized early would solid day hard trek ahead however looked forward much anticipation seemed though black flies come overnight swarming around packed camp i looked upon little site middle nowhere spent two nights perched edge kennicott glacier area rocky moraine mixed scrub brush area donoho lakes area park one two people passing utterly alone silence vastness made mark mind spirit click picture see large panorama donoho peak area camped journey backcountry left me blistered bruised inspired elated overwhelmed humbled ingredients design circumstance transform literally experience wrangells really helped me know i capable little danger body good i desperately wanted bottle feelings preserve let diluted time although aim paintings experiences trip add inspiration internal creative cache using memories sensations culled intense experiences feed work later time i simply enjoying moment every moment much possible i knew take sketchpad would prevented me soaking much i could instead i shot photographs many many photographs trying preserve smells vistas aches pains entire mindblowing uniqueness see tiny yellow dot bottom right hand side shot tent i kidding slightly blurry closer shot yellow tent illustrates sheer magnitude landscape shots departure across moraine seemingly endless sea moraine stretched ahead arched away like veil rocks miles miles rock covered ice framed glacier proper wonderful white ice climbed towards hiked six hours crampons across ice moraine epic truest sense word see glacier appearing like folded blanket moraine mountains behind i took shot night previous see white ice kennicott glacier climbed towards came across pools glacial water blue beyond compare surreal apparently special boots wear designed rigorous walking crampons glaciers let me tell wearing crampons hours hours sure way bring blisters exhilaration superceded discomfort however clinked way glacier mile mile wilderness opened closed around stopped refill water bottles countless glacial streams ice cold water right source i still taste pure icy goodness propelled fueled made way carefully glacier one tidal pools stopped mind could process raw beauty encountered day physically unpredictable unplanned mapped intoxicatingly alien held lots questions route rest keep going turn back like life choosing paths accepting consequences persevering stumbling picking looking back exhausted happiness trials surmounted continued narrowing glacier occasionally skirting edge cliff making way around obstacle another walking lovely like sidewalk times michael said speaking michael entire journey would impossible without supreme organization knowledge land amazing enthusiasm top great time traveling together never estimate power laughter importance preparedness supreme enjoyment get experiencing pieces paradise wonderful friend i stated previously michael summited denali well countless peaks alaska loves challenge ergo perfect traveling companion someone would push me encourage me keep me thinking positively claustrophia bushwhacking frustrations set making way narrowing glacier crevasse typical terrain glacier i petrified falling moulins encountered one particular leg journey i quite nervous moraines end trek situated kennicott root glaciers far camped first night ended taking slightly different route book suggested crossing onto moraine glacier bit earlier distance across moraine probably mile half paper large distance however terrain negotiated made distance feel like miles amazing stressful challenging i loved michael continued pretty unblemished route finding record made way moraines periodic discussions best path take sea icy stoney craziness make way see glacier distance behind michael standing typical boulder found perched glacier detritus immense moving mass ice felt truly though alien planet times shot shows massive moraines kept cracking jokes area trek looking like tatooine luke skywalker home planet star wars keep mind often slipped slid ice underneath rocks even crampons clinging feebly times interactive many scrapes tussles land i lost battle process found another layer respect place takes prisoners feelings simply exists perfect homeostasis opportunity step briefly upon video clip walking along kennicott glacier finally much exertion made back onto root glacier home towards kennicott stashed bikes bushes trail i display badges courage i back settle score moraines retrieved bikes easy bike ride kennicott mccarthy uphill bike essentially coasted lighter packs boot took side trip mccarthy check scene quiet quirky little place quiet hum locals knew well course went short stay headed back truck towards valdez one night camping heading back anchorage even seeing photos weeks adventure happened poignancy still lingers i mentioned i want feelings dissipate cling fiercely i clung rocks threatened give way icy grip moraines i live past cherish feelings energy gleaned experience gained passion outdoors ignited even trip wrangell st elias national park must go beyond textbooks go bypaths untrodden depths wilderness travel explore tell world glories journey john hope franklin
