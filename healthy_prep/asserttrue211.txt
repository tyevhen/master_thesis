modern antidepressants often fail give people relief become fashionable recent years prescribers add adjunctive mood stabilizer lamictal depakote lithium valproate tegretol patient antidepressant mix yielding called cocktail aimed producing better results particularly popular approach bipolar illness mood stabilization critical although also increasingly used treatment unipolar depression i decided take look scientific literature see evidence cocktails work i almost wish i i stunned find evidence adjunctive mood stabilizers scanty low quality studies often unblinded assessment open label unblinded patient knowing taking small study populations producing clinically significant effect one study lamotrigine lamictal popular well tolerated anti seizure medication mood stabilizing side effects involved people another involved patients study patients found adjunctive treatment lamotrigine result significant difference ham total score endpoint study compared paroxetine alone another study patients placebo arm found significant difference treatment groups another lamotrigine monotherapy study looked depression score improvements epilepsy patients controls least randomized double blind placebo controlled study find significantly better improvement beck depression inventory scores weeks lamotrigine group point drop versus placebo group point drop two things need noted otherwise good study first patients average beck score beginning depressed moderate depression beck scale secondly epileptic seizures go away tend study mood naturally tends lighten quite bit investigators claimed corrected i believe second crazy count study proof positive lamotrigine works depression non epileptic patients particularly i eventually stumbled onto double blind placebo controlled study involving bipolar patients published new england journal medicine i thought i hit jackpot study sachs et al seemed like would finally shed light whole mood stabilizers plus antidepressants issue turns real mess one shoddiest muddiest piece crap studies i ever seen nejm many consider top flight journal even overlook conflict interest issue namely fact paper authors received consulting speaking fees abbott labs astrazeneca bristol myers squibb eli lilly glaxosmithkline merck pfizer sanofi wyeth indeed many individual authors received fees every one companies left horribly complex study design patients received either bupropion wellbutrin paroxetine paxil antidepressant placebo combined mood stabilizer consisting lithium valproate combination lithium valproate carbamazepine tegretol protocol amended define mood stabilizers operationally fda approved antimanic agent look see latter means means one group another group atypical antipsychotic drugs never named nowhere study told identity atypical antipsychotic drugs doubt avoid embarrassment sponsors even though third people left study another worsening symptoms think intent treat analysis per se merely advised except noted analyses based last observation carried forward study ran weeks fairly long used stringent outcome measure weeks euthymia remission essentially measurement tool standardized clinical monitoring form adapted mood disorder modules structured clinical interview diagnostic statistical manual mental disorders fourth edition except adapt something sense standardardized parsing study makes me crazy let me cut chase mention principal finding patients receiving mood stabilizer plus antidepressant therapy durable recovery whereas receiving mood stabilizer plus matching placebo met remission standards yes read right placebo group outperformed treatment group yes considered antidepressant adjunctive drug mood stabilizers really found course neither wellbutrin paxil efficacious bipolar illness measured lithium valproate lithium plus valproate tegretol unnamed atypical antipsychotics naturally authors try spin results positively conclusion says use adjunctive standard antidepressant medication compared use mood stabilizers associated increased efficacy increased risk treatment emergent affective switch longer term outcome studies needed fully assess benefits risks antidepressant therapy bipolar disorder longer term studies longer weeks kidding me seriously goodwin et al find pooled analysis two month double blind studies lamotrigine monotherapy versus placebo lamotrigine lamictal superior placebo extending time interventions depression cites median survival placebo days ci calculable lithium median calculable lamotrigine median calculable i sure conclusion based anyway cares times intervention obviating need intervention i done exhaustive systematic review literature however ryan van lieshout glenda macqueen bjpsych review heterogeneity study designs systematic review deserves read detail authors find mood stablizers studies looked clinical response produced signifcant effect relative placebo monotherapy antidpressant used risk ratio expressed adjunctive use cases antidepressant plus mood stabilizer across six studies involving participants combination therapy superior monotherapy rr find good quality studies show beneficial effect lamotrigine monotherapy bipolar depression bipolar looking stabilize mood eliminate reduce mood switches outcomes often measured basis rather basis treating depression per se extrapolating bipolar results unipolar depression thus opinion ill advised good quality studies fact none i could find specifically address adjunctive use mood stabilizers treatment unipolar depression systematic literature review vigo baldessarini subject found suggestive evidence beneficial effects carbamazepine lamotrigine valproate require study especially long term adjunctive use i think probably sums evidence suggestive best whole matter needs study science i saw shoddy scant unconvincing much never published first place i words book mental illness part science part memoir based experience bipolar
