grandstands minnesota state fair little year since i last expanded horizons something i would never event going alaskan cruise seems like i experiencing less less control life last night i scratched another activity i would typically consider going state fair fair minnesota state fair runup event i listed minnesotans apply corrections total duration fairground stadium texas state fair order say texas really largest state fair minnesota i leave argument fair experts i focused people go fair first place fair minnesota extravaganza i fully admitted introvert one really want around large loud masses people consider source review entire life structured around working getting home recovering next day friday focus recovering weekend monday around people awkward social situations pathway recovery introverts seriously delays recovery case introvert recovery needs occur primarily heightened sense tension anxiety many cases spills autonomic symptoms like accelerated heart rate tension feeling flushed overheated subtle change breathing patterns also probably affects perception situations might explain large state fairs i attended wisconsin minnesota experienced like fellini movies i expected i walked gate face face young woman wearing shirt said satan wants distressing problems odd shirt slogans minneapolis large city standard easy avoid city stay suburbs occasions i ventured downtown i never observed crush people i new york city chicago philadelphia fair probably exception rule everywhere i went solid stream humanity people wide often travelling opposite directions seem many destinations week half august sheer number people foot traffic fair probably highest density humanity occurs anywhere state food related issue gluttony probably appropriate term point food fair began take absurdist qualities many times could food deep fried put stick fair seems open question last several years bacon condiment also popular theme bacon added ice cream donuts friend i fair purchased drink piece bacon added swizzle stick part i two bites australian fries basically deep fried waffle fried potatoes dipped batter refried serving size size medium pancake covered either ranch dressing liquefied cheese i conditioned deep fried food really enjoy average minnesotan tends view forays horrifically bad food amusement time tons stuff consumed rapid rate makes usual deep fried fast food seem like health food comparison one health parameters i seen discussed anywhere air quality fair many deep frying deep frying establishments operation aerosolized material vented somewhere many establishments huge roof vents obvious non smoke exhaust aerosolized particles cooking poorly investigated field medicine field interest i would attracted sampling fair aerosolized cooking products deal cigarette smoke wafted designated non designated smoking areas also know humans unique microbial cloud emit bacterial particles per hour raises interesting question whether introversion brain based property whether least part behavior could mediated immune system fair also large number animals adding particles environment dust immunogenic properties i recognize speculative skeptics ask environmentally based illnesses documented fairgoers focus illness disease clearcut health problem i experience fair ambient sound levels general sound levels problem i attend grandstand concert given dixie chicks part dcx world tour mmxvi i could construed fan group demographic underrepresented crowd women mostly age range years old many wearing cowboy boots probably cowboy boots i ever seen outside state texas like concert crowds significant amount drinking going first time long time i caught scent mad dog claim smelled cannabis i detect predominant demographic state intoxication relevant ambient sound levels first digression actual sound system i precise knowledge grandstand sound systems could find details online apart portable stacks speakers monitors wheeled stage appeared two large inverse parabolic arrangement speakers side well level stage opening acts useful comparisons first smooth hound smith duet reminded me country version white stripes except case guitar player also drummer terms sound system seemed overdriven leading distortion unintelligibility lyrics second opening vintage trouble traditional rhythm blues ensemble sound distortion levels much less first psychoacoustics may also affected dynamic lead singer risky opening ask lot audience participation eventually successful probably power high energy personality vocal talent time dixie chicks took stage sound levels less distorted intelligibility lyrics still problem i nosebleed section far left stage i asked people centrally located noticed problem observation problem glad see lyrics projected one point typical fan crowd problem lyrics singing full volume imagine sitting sea year old sopranos singing full volume punctuating songs transitions prolonged screams screams unworldly times befitting audition horror movie course screaming concerts nothing new since early days rock roll rock roll venue dixie chicks considered rock i think definite rock elements including opening recording prince let go crazy well tribute prince complete symbol projected purple background light show judging crowd memorization complex country lyrics synchronized movements dixie chicks produced art significant meaning large segment population sold tens millions albums problem selling venue one valuable lesson presentation marketing country acts presented rock rock events days includes amplification body language inflection associated light show light show associated event first rate including highly stylized version chase scene stars inhabiting unlikely vehicles like old plymouth valiants mercury montegos interlude equipment change also stream consciousness display various prominent politicians flashing across screen possible homage previous political controversy criticized george bush invasion iraq interesting technical observation me thinking lost sound system brought mind recent story freddie mercury late queen vocalist considered one time great rock roll singers study acoustic experts point vibrato range frequency exceeded opera singers also reported octave range although i audio engineer i serious student high fidelity i doubt distorted muddy sound system would allow appreciation characteristics check emotional response capella rendition mercury link hand queen fans could probably similarly great time venue parallel manner dixie chicks fans despite knowing lyrics deafened fans put low fidelity sound system i able relate music couple levels i bluegrass fan bluegrass derivations circle unbroken music origins one point played bluegrass instrumental banjo violin also worked side musicians excellent bluegrass stylings mandolin acoustic guitar electric guitar would i see like fair anytime soon extraordinary circumstances got me time circumstances would repeat future i go ear protection would must i might tempted bring along sound meter noise cancellation head phones see i could block screaming hear i would also opt seating center grandstand
