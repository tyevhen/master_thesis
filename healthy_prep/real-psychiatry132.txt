i hospitalist word fashionable july i completed year post residency stint community mental health center part public health service scholarship payback one years i commuted another miles keep community hospital psychiatric unit open i headed hospital i rotating internship internal medicine pediatrics neurology real metropolitan inpatient treatment setting i known point residency program interns split two groups group worked one major county hospitals twin cities unique setting time psychiatrists provided almost medical coverage able diagnose treat lot common medical problems write patient medications attend acute medical problems appropriate diagnosis triage i wide range medical problems admitted directly me ranging gunshot wounds delirium psychiatrist working conditions realizes term medically stable relative one i many patients admitted service severe medical problems also severe psychiatric disorder symptomatic time many cases i rapidly assess transfer medicine intensive care setting i excellent back consultants many day best physicians i ever seen really want hear me unless i specific probable diagnosis evaluation done many places psychiatry jobs like exist anymore anyone asks me similar positions i actively discourage accepting similar job arrangement work far long medical care provided free psychiatrists get extra credit days six covering bed wards five days week ads psychiatrists days often speak psychiatric hospitalists every one specified medical coverage also tend leave part basically rapid triage discharge position job either maintain cooperate high discharge rates thing common internists family physicians come designated hospitalists work days days schedule people question i naturally picked week copy new england journal medicine see two perspective pieces hospitalists say i also interested brother internist years discussed issue length initial essay wachter goldman documents rapid rise hospitalist care medical specialty since number hospitalists increased fold makes hospitalists largest speciality within internal medicine cite growth managed care medicare drg payments possible evidence reasons growth field i always skeptical term efficiency especially combined term quality i guess difficult people accept fact managed care medicare drg payments rationing mechanisms tied quality tenuous thread government healthcare company rhetoric advertising critical question efficiency certainly efficient administer group physicians work days days happen chain command lot easier get accept role rationing care interest hospital health care group patient personal physician may see part role patient advocacy authors interesting take deficiencies model talk days day model implying period physician literally suggests time might better spent contributing key institutional programs me schedule seems conducive burnout anyone works needs time fully recover i never seen study cognitive efficiency days conversations hospitalists suggests day starts plummet hospitalists supplanting specialists subspecialists inpatient attendings suggest trainees less exposure basic translational science although stated article model involves eliminating whole blocks specialty care i worked hospital entire neurology service eliminated hospitalist care i questioned decision i told internist interested strokes changing neurologists attendings consultants hospitalists primary physicians neurological problems changes entire nature care also changes associated nursing care staff ongoing interest care complex neurology patients authors also note hospitalists seem focused investigating common inpatient illnesses suggest possible remedies seem like major problems get worse increasing business rather academic emphasis medicine gunderman points opposed usual delineators speciality care patient age physician skillset body system hospitalists delineated patient location make explicit relationship location list putative benefits looking length stay example could logically follow concentrated effort location clinical effort administrative one points increasing number hospitalists per se taken evidence benefit perverse incentives exist i agree perverse low reimbursement incentive high volume practice seeing complex inpatients high frequency initial discharge assessments may reduce volume necessary productivity demands i psychiatric hospitalist dimension manipulated number ways i initially told i responsible set number inpatient beds point great deal pressure me start running outpatient clinics would interesting seeing inpatients i resisted significant leverage nobody else wanted job i eventually run geriatric psychiatry memory disorder clinic many years continuing inpatient work clinic eventually closed administrators claimed productivity high enough work nurse neurologist i needed collateral data collected work expectation would see complex dementia patients everything nurse clinic closed two decades political wrangling around inpatient productivity current consensus covering inpatient beds reasonable approach one point i covering beds help excellent physician assistant cost teaching critical aspect gunderman thesis emphasis physician patient relationship exemplified sentence true core good medicine institution relationship relationship two human beings points physicians affiliated institutions creates significant conflicts interest isolates hospital staff rest medical community naturally leads less expertise entire community also creates illusion institution rather
