maddening problem genome annotation determining sense strand gene especially gene short genome high gc content thus contains stop codons reverse translation convince real serious problem browse genomes see ridiculously high number hypothetical proteins genomes bogus overlaps genes score blast hits reverse complement mode frame zero artifacts direct result aforesaid problem i presented examples problem confusion i want show particularly maddening example see i talking i suggest solution following graphic shows region coli uti several genes shown overlapping say existing opposite strands dna coverage area small overlaps sometimes happen genes whole genes rarely ever overlap never clusters situation shown bogus see time public genomes fact genes shown also show overlaps mycobacterium abscessus see gene ouw citrobacter koseri strain atcc baa gene cko quite others glimmer choked exact situation many times many genomes region overlapping genes genome coli uti big gene top strand middle uti dna sequence annotated else hypothetical protein abscessus version gene marked cellobiose phosphorylase find many blast hits rothia version gives value similar cellobiose phosphorylase genes organisms uniprot org elsewhere course bogus represent glimmer choke points question one determine sure coli hypothetical protein uti wobble base gc percentage whereas gene opposite strand pointing left namely uti marked membrane bound atp synthase f sector alpha subunit gc much higher gc organism like mycobacterium pseudomonas would find gene higher gc percentage crown winner time right case simple gene higher gc value necessarily winner course particular example cheat look identities genes immediate vicinity hypothetical protein bottom strand find bottom strand genes atpase subunits mystery solved right sure particular case situations overlapping genes shown hypothetical protein find many cases genome burkholderia pseudomallei strain example hypothetical overlaps hypothetical low gc genome one favorite cheats final solution check gene ag percentage adenine plus guanine codon base one percentage averages something like protein coding genes problem ag often whether read gene forward backward antisense strand reverse complement gene usually high ag forward ag usually almost trick dream fail edge cases gc helpful high gc genomes ag helpful sometimes shine dalgarno signals universally used organisms even use usually reserved highly conserved genes encoding things like ribosomal proteins gene context helpful cases others turns best clue positively identifying correct strand correct reading frame codon usage frequency patterns know codon frequencies genome wide given organism use information good advantage even genome therefore codon table contains inaccuracies long codon frequencies approximately correct use verify reading frame protein coding gene algorithm i came simple yet effective given gene read triplet bases sequentially score triplet twice keep two scores going first score according frequency codon table organism score according second table developed reverse complement codons following table shows codon frequencies caulobacter crescentus na encounter hypothetical protein gene caulobacter could decide whether strand assignment correct first develop score gene reading triplets adding frequency value corresponding codon running total example encounter triplet ctg add score see table every occurrence ctt add ctc add using values table codon frequencies caulobacter crescentus na also create anticodon frequency table follows every codon original table apply score corresponding reverse complement codon antcodon table ctg first table would contain value would apply cag reverse complement ctg second table i call first table forward table second table back table one represents frequencies codons encountered protein genes forward reading direction represents frequencies applied reverse complement codons codons read reverse direction opposite dna strand scoring unknown gene tally forward table score keep separate score using back table done gene forward table score greater back table score reading gene wrong strand i scored crescentus cb genes using technique i found genes gave back score higher forward score interestingly i checked identities putative backwards annotated genes listed hypothetical proteins four genes assigned functions gave suspect scores one turns identity match reverse gene ccna caulobacter crescenstus na three less bases long could well non coding regions challenging test i turned genome rothia mucilaginosa dy one disastrous annotation nightmares time genome dy find protein coding genes total involved significant overlaps overlaps genome almost certainly overannotated least genes i trained program codon usage table r mucilaginosa contains fewer overlaps dy tallied codon anticodon scores dy cds genes end genes gave scores indicative reversed reading frame fact involved overlaps codon scoring effective method i know programs like glimmer use quite obvious using though every genome reverse annotated genes hundreds cases easily detected using simple method record caulobacter crescentus cb genes appear annotated wrong strand
