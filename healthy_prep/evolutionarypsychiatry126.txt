today go back basics depression borodin nocturne right click open new tab i would say three main theories held general public causes depression bootstrap theory lazy good nothing needs snap get get better trauma theory much stress death trauma etc chemical imbalance ssri deficiency serotonin needs regulated see memorable old zoloft commercial course i subscribe theories entirely though elements hold kernel truth belief one largely supported literature stress genetic susceptibility leads depressive symptoms mediated inflammatory means brain certainly one capable getting getting exercising eating right helpful sometimes asking depressed person wake early exercise like asking someone broken ankle go run frontal lobe firing cylinders motivation zazz scientifically minded probably familiar theory number three medical terms chemical imbalance theory called monoamine hypothesis depression monoamine theory i would say largely accepted doctors certain age even psychiatrists holds much water carbohydrate insulin theory obesity back day medication blood pressure called reserpine among things depletes brain serotonin indeed tend cause depression rarely used nowadays first antidepressant drug used treat tuberculosis found serendipitously one actions change concentrations monoamines serotonin norepinephrine synapse nerves thus monoamine hypothesis depression born along billion dollar antidepressant industry antidepressants affect monoamines one way another work lucky often side effects maybe protect brain one episode depression seem protect next episode go medicine feel better talk therapy compared medicines seems long term benefit surprisingly along way monoamine theory picked bunch diseases called affective spectrum disorders including major depressive disorder anxious twin generalized anxiety disorder migraines irritable bowel syndrome bipolar disorders social phobia ptsd ocd fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome among others diseases shown respond somewhat three different classes antidepressant medication problem measure serotonin depressed people levels often map fact low serotonin really correlate depression well though low serotonin central nervous system correlate suicide violence insomnia brain researchers quickly figured monoamine hypothesis pretty big holes mechanism antidepressants increasing serotonin monoamines synapse rather changing efficiency monoamine signals transmitted instead current literature supported theory brain pathology depression affective spectrum disorders leads two things going awry immune system inflammation mitochondrial dysfunction messy study depression consider facts look modern criteria classic unipolar major depression smallish subset whole people depression symptoms atypical depression leaden feelings arms legs increased appetite increased sleep opposed classic weight loss insomnia atypical depression meet criteria bipolar spectrum disorders depressive disorders often comorbid adhd anxiety substance abuse disorders see try study group patients major depressive disorder criteria represents typical clinical outpatient get mix people various complicating neuropsych problems studies called pure major depressive disorders problems excluded typical pharmaceutical studies necessarily generalizable actual population add frequent comorbid medical conditions whole soup pathology depressed inpatients pain typically headaches muscle aches irritable bowel migraines often found along metabolic syndrome pre diabetes diabetes obesity however rather taken aback complexities theories mitochondrial dysfunction inflammation scoop entire variable pathology makes theories pleasing me let start mitochondria know energy factories cells primary mission make cellular equivalent gasoline atp problems mitochondria tend show symptoms energetically hungry cells muscle nerves nutritionally coq carnitine vitamin selenium deficiencies also cause mitochondrial dysfunction directly mitochondria desperately need micronutrients work efficiently symptoms mitochondrial dysfunction non specific cognitive symptoms similar found depression including impairments attention executive function memory tellingly families known genetic problems mitochondria symptoms worsen around times stress overwork fasting exercise environmental temperature extremes children mitochondrial disorders likely depressed control children among adults folks known mitochondrial disorders likely depression chronic fatigue major depressive disorders bipolar disorder panic disorder general population typical chicken egg clinical stuff maybe people genetic mitochondrial problems lot stress thus depressed biochemical evidence mitochondrial dysfunction major depressive disorders bipolar disorder autopsies show sorts interesting problems mitochondrial proteins unusual mitochondrial dna mutations poor mitochondrial complex activity atp production rates respiratory chain enzyme ratios seem decreased muscle biopsied patients major depressive disorder pain fact several studies shown patients high degree somatic complaints typically muscle aches much lower atp production average muscle chronic fatigue patients similar abnormalities found finally mouse models mitochondrial dysfunction mice bipolar like symptoms altered levels turnover monoamines researchers worked mitochondrial dysfunction cause monoamine depletion leading mouse mood disorders mitochondrial problems brought genetically also micronutrient deficiencies cause oxidative stress eventually lead nerve damage psychiatric symptoms specifics pathology role inflammation next post
