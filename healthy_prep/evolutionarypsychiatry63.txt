i midst new academic year talks last week i went brigham women hospital behavioral neurology interest group talk last thursday boston university medical center psychiatry grand rounds i like academic talks though naturally audience much skeptical ancestral health symposium paleofx folks skepticism good keeps me toes brigham behavioral neurology group i immediate questions involving long ancestors lived old individual owned beautiful choppers ancient maori skull died exactly questions asked staffan lindeberg company determine kitavan elders seem symptoms dementia important questions i answers many i wanted i think i held i try make point blog answers rather asking questions research meaningful way government food plate leads whole grain sugary honey nut cereal big healthy part diet beautiful nutrient rich egg yolks deadly maybe step back think moment grand rounds boston medical center went well i thought talk received interest i certainly thank dr searl dr chapman inviting me speak i hope someone thinks research idea i particularly hopeful get research fructose malabsorption depression see swoops work around recently i hard work reading amazing textbook immune system evolution recommended me kurt harris textbook quite bit say mental illness whole chapter pages quite amazing anthropology hygiene hypothesis tends avoid mental illness much easier focus diabetes obesity autoimmune disease easily marked tallied mental illness defined recipe book symptoms call dsmivtr well stress related psychiatric disorders nearly i think particularly depressive anxiety disorders associated markers inflammation particularly raised levels proinflammatory cytokines proinflammatory cytokines famously interferon alpha used treat hepatitis induce depression folks previous symptoms thus reasonable assume immune dysregulation immune system bit whack like army milling without clear leadership could part mental illness like autoimmune disease allergic disorders athma hay fever type i diabetes multiple sclerosis inflammatory bowel diseases ulcerative colitis increasing preciptiously developed world recent decades old friends hypothesis suggests effect missing major regulator immune system co evolved thousands upon thousands generations three classes organisms lived within passed ancestors recently pseudocommensals commensals parasitic worms old friends hypothesis article dirty several arms immune system kind like infantry navy military intelligence various forms helper cells th th secrete inflammatory cytokines tell arms immune system come forth attack tell th th cells back third variety cell called tregs short regulatory cells infection old friends pinworms tapeworms pseudocommensals like soil mycobacteria seems cause continuous activation tregs keeping th th cells check effect old friends organisms always become part immune system wonder problems longer old friends disposal th th regulated inflammation associated anxiety depression pro inflammatory cytokines il il il il tnfalpha interferon alpha gamma th side il il levels related symptoms depression cancer patients others downstream agents reactive protein cerulosplasmin lower levels zinc albumin also associated depression symptoms also increased levels neutrophils complement proteins seen acute exacerbations bipolar disorder major depressive disorder seems people increased levels background inflammation susceptible interferon il administration causing depressive symptoms well go th side things th excess seems associated allergies hay fever ulcerative colitis whereas th excess associated autoimmune diseases type i diabetes crohns evidence specific cytokines clear however people allergies known greater incidence depression asthma sufferers seem clinically significant depression allergies associated increased risk suicide asthma also clearly associated anxiety studies also experienced clinician tell trouble breathing causes great anxiety worries future attacks however association begs important question immune dysregulation causing anxiety asthma asthma symptoms particularly prone causing anxiety better handle th cytokines il experimental tests problematic may know enzyme called ido tryptophan leading depletion serotonin inflammation seems activate ido whereas antidepressants ssris seem deactivate may secret might work pregnancy bias toward th regulatory cells thought prevent immune attack growing fetus mothers somewhat immune compromised state particularly third trimester actually decrease incidence autoimmune symptoms pregnancy pregnancy however seem th bounce back lead exacerbation inflammatory disorders depression increased metabolism tryptophan increases th related cytokines dead weather i ca hear starts ad skipped seconds gut depression raised levels immune cytokines seen depression caused leaky gut levels antibodies directed several gut bacterial species elevated people depression suggesting leakiness leakiness associated increased bacterial endotoxin crossing gut barrier leading increases proinflammatory cytokines could plausibly cause depression symptoms gut epithelial barrier permeability highly dependent upon enteric immune system parasites healthy normal commensal organisms may help regulate protect normal gut integrity coincidence chron ulcerative colitis associated higher levels affective disorders depression also common folks vascular disease high risk heart attacks thrombotic strokes metabolic syndrome associated athersclerosis heart disease also associated depressive symptoms brain derived neurotrophic factor nerve fertilizer sorts seems diminished depression vascular disease levels bdnf low treatment seem rise response succesful treatment autoimmune diseases ms also noted low levels bdnf lot intriguing connections whole body immune pathology depression anxiety symptoms gut immune dysregulation may keys disorders take time asking correct questions find whether issues fundamental importance psychiatrists might want read immune system however part continuing medical education clear benefits hygenic water supply unless like cholera breakfast eating dirt unchecked parasitic infections go drink untreated pondwater reading post guess better study organisms lead safe ingenious ways emulate old friends much less risk drinking untreated water living hookworms thorough grounding immunology beyond scope post however wikepedia articles give good start
