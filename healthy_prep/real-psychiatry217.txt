motivation acts material describes event something world see counterargument journalist seems important public hear information makes expected argument press news needs reported also spins political angle suggests conservative gun advocates including sheriff involved recent incident fox news elected name perpetrator connects right wing tendency talk mental illness problem uncontrolled access firearms i point i cringe reading highly politicized arguments probably i hear comes psychiatry general form argument people taking certain position certain ideology therefore conflict interest issue
