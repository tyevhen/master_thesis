day i learned acquaintance mine done graduate work famous molecular genetics lab started talking shop i happened mention recent bioinformatics forays particular recent unexpected finding purine content mrna predicted guanine plus cytosine content genome purine content protein coding regions dna correlates overall content genome higher content double stranded dna higher purine content single stranded mrna total bacterial genomes analyzed graph organisms high content tend relatively small genomes one reason scatter toward right side graph correlation r friend asked implications might i offered couple thoughts first i said differences content genes given organism sometimes used detect foreign genes embedded phage virus genes horizontal gene transfers etc variations purine pyrimidine ratio gene coding strands might also way detect foreign genes example organism like clostridium botulinum genome coding regions average purine content finding gene purine content two standard deviations away mean might tipoff gene came different organism useful new technique genes high purine content coding regions always high content thus detection horizontal gene transfers via purine loading expose genes would otherwise missed basis content words two genes might exactly characteristics differ purine content difference purine content would tipoff possible horizontal gene transfer event another implication versus relationship involves foreign rna detection bacteria need able detect self versus non self nucleic acids incoming phage nucleic acids need detected destroyed fact restriction enzymes discovered messenger rna secondary structure undergoes folding based intrastrand regions complementarity amount complementarity depends relative abundances purine pyrimidines pair one another strand rna mostly purines mostly pyrimidines matter less opportunity self anneal purines pyrimidines equally abundant thus folding rna different organism high genome content low content organism low example purine loading affect folding shown graphic shows minimum free energy folding mrna catalase staphylococcus epidermidis strain rpa left pseudomonas putida strain gb right staph version messenger rna ratio purines pyrimidines whereas pseudomonas version purine pyrimidine ratio result potential purine pyrimidine hydrogen bonding considerably less staph version mrna pseudomonas version easily see comparing two rnas shown one left far loops areas bases complementary complex branching structures mrna right long sections molecule able line form double stranded structures loops number small minimum free energy folding two catalase mrnas one high purine content staphylococcus left one lower purine content pseudomonas right foldings generated rna tbi univie ac cgi bin rnafold cgi click enlarge image kind difference explain ability various strains bacteria reject infectious rna another strain viruses phage foreign rna entering cell look foreign cell endogenous complement rna nucleases based host nucleases quickly destroy intruder rna mechanism provides primitive kind immune system bacteria one important implication purine loading curve curve resolves one long standing open question molecular biology mutation rates i talk tomorrow post please join me bring biologist friend
