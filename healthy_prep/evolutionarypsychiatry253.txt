little update found website research updates chronotherapuetics may interest chronotherapeutics org index end little update i going spend time discussing nitty gritty genetics biochemistry related mood disorders especially treatments mood disorders circadian rhythm abnormalities bet ca wait mean time however i came upon neat articles process chronotherapeutics using light therapy dark therapy sleep deprivation sleep phase delay advance treat mood disorders depression bipolar disorder little warning methods powerful quick affect neurotransmitter systems psychiatric medications different post good idea experiment lonesome let me give worst case scenario try treat depression light therapy sleep deprivation turns bipolar get manic spend new stereo system sleep boss antagonize friends relatives end hospital singing opera naked rooftop invented entirely unreasonable scenario best let loved ones know attempt methods already psychiatric diagnosis attempt methods without blessing

driving around small towns alaska reducing winter suicide rate along way let get back basics chronotherapeutics general interventions lead sleep phase advance waking early going sleep early antidepressant effect sleep phase delay going sleep later waking later depressant anti manic effect also reinforcing natural circadian rhythm tend help mental illness hospitals canada italy noticed patients sunny easterly facing rooms discharged average days earlier patients rooms without much sunlight even interestingly differences minimal winter extended days autumn surprisingly discovered intrepid ancestors classical texts descriptions psychiatric wards showed depressed patients advised spend time doors agitated patients closed darkened rooms one old fashioned newly fashionable method treating sorts depression sleep deprivation sd complete sleep deprivation self explanatory partial sleep deprivation generally involves waking people second half night known contraindication sleep

antidepressant medications suggesting me truth told i read papers evidence theory genetic issues circadian rhythm system primary problem leading vulnerability bipolar disorder due tricky nature bipolar depression risk switching mania antidepressant drugs robust data shown chronotherapeutics sleep deprivation phase advance light therapy condition mood stabilizers work upon circadian rhythm proteins enhance continue initial benefits brought via chronotherapeutics medicine remains useful chronotherapeutics discontinued one ca sleep deprived forever example depression return within hours normal night sleep fact studied bipolar depressed patients remain normal mood chronotherapeutics alone repeating intervention always help people tend become tolerant treatment one way ameliorating tolerance chronotherapeutic techniques combine example severely depressed patient known bipolar disorder hospital start days sleep deprivation begin phase advance treatment going bed early waking early morning light therapy retain benefits time perhaps add mood stabilizers enhance effect i go specifics mood stabilizers antidepressants affect directly circadian rhythm system another post give preliminary taste serum pet spect fmri data shown antidepressants sleep deprivation phase delay light therapy affect neurotransmitter system similar areas brain recipe nearly immediate reversal severe bipolar depression maintenance normal mood foreseeable future interesting part discussion chronotherapeutics techniques physical lights light therapy patented therefore less short term economic motivation future study case evolutionary medicine ideas however countries socialized medicine far sighted bureaucrats might see writing wall cheap interventions sticking depressed patients easterly
