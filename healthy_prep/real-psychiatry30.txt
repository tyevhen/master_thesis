i posted obstructive sleep apnea osa continuous positive airway pressure cpap last year well received since i given lot advice cpap based post general people i consulted i continue encounter problems i mentioned original post message i continuing give people view cpap option may seem like critical intervention prevent cardiac metabolic complications obstructive sleep apnea several severe potentially life shortening anyone diagnosis owes family make cpap work avoid morbidity mortality associated osa common practice standard sleep assessment hear person diagnosed sleep study cpap recommended various reasons using machine i frequently hear patient throws middle night ca stand anything face even case diagnosed severe sleep apnea comments like seem understate seriousness problem many cases insurance companies asked machine back record sd card machine shows used person sitting front me untreated osa complicated physical health compromised immediate complications untreated apnea hypertension also compromises psychiatric care osa daytime somnolence becomes insomnia person may expect medical treatment insomnia prescription sedating drugs actually good idea people sleep disordered breathing think true hypertension several medications make hypertension worse i would prescribe people uncontrolled hypertension despite qualifiers i see medication doses i would prescribe given people untreated osa untreated largely person give cpap chance tips i give people found work i working sleep lab clinic i seeing study seen wide range technicians supposed help mask fit instructions use machine try various masks types cpap lot people try full face mask throw repeatedly night decide feeling confined mask problem smaller modified masks nasal cpap try several find one works best use humidification surprising many people think save time using humidification system machine using humidification another sure way tolerate cpap maintain adjust humidification maximum comfort adjusting cpap make sure air leaks order cpap work air pressure transmitted upper airway maintain splinting effect prevent obstruction air leaks put pressure risk prevent effective use cpap trying find air leaks frustrating fitting occurs technician respiratory therapist problems home associated sleep positions wide array equipment available unlikely able find device works cases may take apap device readout morning see graphic tell significant air leaks mask fit air leaks get modern apap machine feed back apap abbreviation automatic positive airway pressure machine able sense increasing obstruction adjust pressure one main advantages lower baseline pressure used obstruction occurs devices increases pressure overcome standard cpap devices pressure set based original sleep study case significant obstruction could mean constant high pressure constant high pressures lead side effects ear pain pressure effects really strong point apap devices generally much sophisticated pieces equipment make data available internet sleep medicine physician remotely adjust settings based downloaded data also allow patient download data morning via smartphone app see graphic know hours wore device night pressure settings many apneic hypopneic episodes occurred ahi apnea hypopnea index per hour optimize sleeping position preparation night based apap readout modern apap allows individual patient unprecedented control treatment sleep apnea feedback every morning assured device working previous example i showed patient increasing upper airway obstruction eventually episodes atrial fibrillation idea system airleaks ahi increasing developed atrial fibrillation new apap system would immediate feedback day sleep positions also lead better apap cpap performance apap device feedback within days side sleeping better lower ahi back sleeping looking readout ahi monday example patient determined sleeping side consistently fewer episodes slept back ahis range final advantage knowing apap device allows patient advocate form i know widely known clearly health plans provide cpap devices patients diagnosed osa apap devices expensive based i written clear superior devices oral appliances osa inferior cpap measured outcomes like ahi i updated post include comment oral appliances oa cpap based question i received i commonly see people dislike cpap use oa instead claim works better cpap i doubt improve snoring reduce ahi based improvement problem improvement ahi generally nearly enough considered adequate level treatment ahi reason expert guidelines recommend oa snoring alone osa case patient intolerant cpap advertisements dental approach osa commonplace usually cite years experience clinician determining factor i would recommend considering sleep study oa place see much ahi improved case apap machine read number smartphone app every morning use numbers determine best treatment condition newly diagnosed osa prescribed cpap sure get complete discussion cpap versus apap doctor recommending one ask sleep medicine physician ideal solution rather insurance company covers cost limiting factor used resanitized equipment may option treatment osa cpap apap never better make sure get machine system comfortable works apap devices give consistent feedback easily accessible ways hack cpap device read information sd card much easier pull data app immediate daily feedback
