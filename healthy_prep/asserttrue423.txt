i offer conjecture bit preposterous sounding could well hold true i actually think i propose evolution level bacteria though probably higher levels driven hydrogen peroxide theory rests three assumptions one creation new bacterial species happens almost entirely via lateral gene transfer heritable point mutations secondly bacteria marine terrestrial regularly exposed challenges hydrogen peroxide environment thirdly challenges drive lateral gene transfer evidence first assumption embarrassingly abundant speed subject i suggest read excellent paper lateral gene transfer olga zhaxybayeva ford doolittle current biology april pp r unlocked copy common find given bacterial species trace good percentage protein base ancestors far removed horizontally ancestors conventional sense consider coli hundreds strains coli genes ranging number per strain problem various strains coli genes common far genes render fully functional coli coli pan genome actually takes gene families total certainly draw family tree coli based ribosomal polymorphisms explain pan genome genes came family tree metaphor quickly breaks start drawing trees based proteins get many conflicting trees correct trees like fiction bacteria concerned tree life like net life web life directed acyclic graph genes coming species course arrive way mechanisms like transformation transduction conjugation allow direct entry foreign dna bacterial cell one time thought conjugation could occur bacteria species known cross species conjugation also occurs example coli streptomyces mycobacterium transduction viruses package infected host genes virus capsules taken another cell occurs naturally bacterial populations response environmental factors like ultraviolet light hydrogen peroxide exposure virus carrying lysogenic cell uv light peroxide induce runaway production virus fact mechanism used streptococcus kill competitive staphylococcus cells clever bit chemical warfare known years hydrogen peroxide cause many types bacteria shed dna know hydrogen peroxide signalling molecule signals among things lysogenic bacteria go lytic cycle also signals cells mount known sos response global response oxidative challenge years ago bruce ames colleagues showed exposing salmonella dilute micromolar hydrogen peroxide caused cells differentially express sos proteins including heat shock proteins low fidelity dna repair systems know hydrogen peroxide dilute micromolar induce phage virus production marine bacteria significant rainwater contains hydrogen peroxide concentrations micromolar ocean water known reach millimolar levels ho rain storm wondering rain contains hydrogen peroxide peroxide gets two ways one uv frequency photochemistry water cleaved oh reforms ho via ionization reactions caused lightning lightning energetic enough bring airborne oxygen water plasma state resulting ionization rearrangement free atoms yields certain amount hydrogen peroxide presence ho rainwater confirmed many times fact well preserved fossil record polar icepacks going back centuries polar snowpacks contain ppb ho varies seasonally max coming summer bottom line every rain event land sea constitutes hydrogen peroxide challenge microbes induces viral transduction release whole cell dna lysis inevitably used transformation also induces low fidelity dna repair guaranteed help evolution along every rain event words chance evolution thing bacteria means gene sharing within across species lines darwin theory tree like ancestor basis living things dead wrong least bacteria ford doolittle wrote classic book chapter lateral gene transfer called tree life fell would recognize sound estimates horizontal gene transfer occurs every ten billion vertical replications would enough ensure gene modern genome unbroken history vertical descent back hypothetical last universal common ancestor see article obvious me least every rain event carries potential cause far gene transfers necessary according doolittle make vertical inheritance fade insignificance evolutionary bringer change hydrogen peroxide rain driving lateral gene transfer bacteria eons fact arguably dominant driver evolution bacteria sorry mr darwin point mutations handed sons daughters cutting
