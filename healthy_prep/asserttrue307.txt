recent findings virology forced biologists consider many notions years ago would seemed heretical science fiction like example serious discussion possibility cellular life descended viruses virus world theory see also paper growing still minority viewpoint viruses considered symbionts rather simply parasites see review villereal dared propose eukaryotic cell nucleus actually stemmed virus others speculated reverse large dna viruses actually escaped spore like nucei meanwhile say earlier rna world viruses became original inventors dna question large viruses ncdlv class nucleus like properties within short time infection viruses set complex structure inside cell known virus factory factory looks lot like cell nucleus authors recent paper mimivirus famously huge virus infects freshwater amoeba admitted previous work fact mistake virus factory nucleus see photo nucleus virus factory photo vp virus particle enormous mimivirus developing inside acanthamoeba smaller virus factory beginning form left macroscopic aspects aside large nucleocytoplasmic viruses infect animals marine life amoeba bring many genes enzymes normally found cell nucleus i talking genes dna polymerases topoisomerases etc genes small molecules previous post i mentioned example pbcv virus infects alga chlorella gene aspartate transcarbamylase atcase enzyme catalyzes first committed step pyrimidine synthesis enzyme common living things predominantly found cell nucleus higher organisms examples many ncldv group viruses gene deoxy utp pyrophosphatase enzyme breaks high energy phosphates dutp uracil accidentally incorporated dna one imagine virus invades cell unleashes nucleases cell rna many ribonucleotides breakdown products rna liberated many reduced deoxy nucleotides ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase preparation viral dna synthesis happens dutp quite easily incorporated dna promiscuous watson crick pairing nucleobases resulting malformed dna trigger apoptosis cells virus takes chances brings dutpase make sure uracil never gets dna mistake viruses bring gene thymidylate synthase bring conversion dump dtmp words methylation uracil deoxy ribonucleoside monophosphate form give thymidine monophosphate also gene thymidylate kinase converts dtmp often called tmp dtdp tdp yet another small molecule enzyme encoded large dna viruses ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase rdpr enzyme fundamental whole dna synthesis enterprise job convert ordinary ribonucleotides deoxy form dna needs without enzyme make rna dna typically found cell nucleus higher organisms turns gene rdpr contained great many viral genomes i blast search protein sequence chlorella virus ribonucleoside reductase uniprot database virus sequences search came back hits spanning viruses belonging ncdlv class pox mimivirus phycodnaviruses etc also herpesviridae plus many bacteriophage groups well terms sheer variety virus groups involved hard think another small molecule processing enzyme spans many viral taxa talking everything relatively small bacteriophages mimivirus lots reductase gene widespread made me wonder phylogenetic distribution might look like words viral rdprs related related host rdpr enzyme evolution follow viral path host path fun i obtained number ribonucleoside reductase small subunit protein sequences viruses plants animals bacteria fungi various eukaryotic parasites using tools uniprot org fed results tree maker phylogeny fr i got following maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree see paper details tree algorithm also sure check nifty paper learn read sort tree convenience names viruses depicted blue notice except vaccinia variola group deeply nested viral nodes ancestral higher organism nodes go many levels viral ancestors get original universal ancestor presuming one reductase gene pig say diagram would appear pox family reductase gene derived way highly evolved host exception rule viral genes outgroups usually ancestors one another mimivirus fairly high chain shows relatedness two common freshwater soil bacteria pseudomonas burkholderia would fun go back remake tree adding organisms end trying let me know results i comfortable concluding except pox family viruses ribonucleoside reductase produced major dna viruses phages derived current day hosts parsimonious necessarily correct explanation phage reductases ancestral host orthologs also possible phage reductases derive ancient hosts depicted tree current day hosts appearing derive phage genes fact similarity long ago host ortholog case tree shows organismal rdprs tend related organismal rdprs viral versions related viral versions see anywhere viral sub tree growing host sub tree would case viral enzymes simply derived modern host enzymes
