informative editorial nature week phil williamson scientific expert ocean acidification i like concept bullshit referred professor harry frankfurt classic essay many times i familiar brandolini law i read essay simply stated brandolini law amount energy needed refute bullshit order magnitude bigger produce also simply known bullshit asymmetry principle williamson uses political example libertarian web site central piece article ocean ph decreasing climate change would lead reduced carbon dioxide oceans climate changing worry ocean ph would change original publication denied williamson rebuttal opinion piece professional journal led author libertarian piece write online work squashed like slug nothing like elite scientific dialogue uk apparently press watchdog called uk independent press standards organization ipso williamson filed complaint factual accuracy piece awaiting verdict goes illustrate brandolini law comes play situation original author days essentially anyone journalist blogger points online journalism seems subject rules leaves anyone position responding factually inaccurate claim distinct disadvantage may formal complaint procedure probably editorial hierarchy many web sites count bloggers writers produce content attach advertising content seem little oversight terms accuracy much content social web sites makes referred fake news williamson position clear thinks inaccuracies need responded corrected accurately points audience correction authors readers interested accuracy science i think division clear number reasons large number people really care involved emotion generated issue make decisions based facts general attitude promulgated political process countries rarely rational discussion main issues day i think goes lot deeper generating rebuttals needs education difference science everything else good example creationist based rhetoric denial evolution creationist advocates seem recognize engaged process nothing like science therefore scientifically prove anything fail recognize basic issue science process immutable collection writings written ancient prophets subject many interpretations failure recognition also leads failure recognize completely outside field science fail recognize best critics scientific theory scientists field failure recognition much wider creationists journalists produce many examples least consistent bias psychiatry bias present whether editorial oversight great example journalistic tendency propose psychiatry proceed attack straw man interestingly outsiders training medicine psychiatry often joined insiders pushing arguments one case prominent journal editor came endorsed anti psychiatry book proclaiming legitimate criticism fact book rhetorical i would presume medical editors without common biases many forces producing misinformation i diverge bit williamson approach refuting misinformation hoping best i think additional considerations one thing clear head sand approach taken physician professional organizations response misinformation clearly good idea sure lose current propaganda war misinformation political corruption lesson current presidential campaign small margin typical fact less campaign one anything said whether true nobody seems care foreboding levels public policy especially political spoils includes able appoint agency heads lack basic footing science also lack knowledge constitutes science country run maintain standards science technology engineering needs basic understanding fields branches government highest levels currently better example happens unscientific manage store happened american medicine cursed work rules made go little practice medicine live pseudo scientific management practices affect work flow detract lifelong task learning science medicine strategies i offer blogger follow i also additional strategies i going keep myself right time present facts counter rhetoric important recognize common forms rhetoric without pedantic best way pointing erroneous aspects argument overall form without naming fallacy sounds easy physicians psychiatrists seem spellbound times simplest arguments one common example anytime business executive shows talks cost effectiveness everybody shuts nobody seems understand business rhetoric obvious fact years intensive management cost effectiveness per capita health care costs higher country next highest per capita expenditures health care certainly better case treating mental illnesses substance use disorders much worse somebody needs stand say part going start get way let work give resources provide adequate service shut rationing clearly ineffective costly way provide health care services recognize bullshit matter comes many arguments health care reform plain erroneous would continuous supply essentially blogposts front respected medical journals could anyone expect health care reform ideas year years would worth anything top posts implemented like electronic health record managed care business intermediaries government purchasers pharmaceutical benefit managers creating various financial incentives progressively worse ideas sifting misinformation correct false lies bullshit tedious necessary task long medical journals legitimize constant stream unscientific information countering remain onerous task sources bullshit go far beyond blogs traditional journalism let anyone define common strategy days detractors tend jump set stage false criticism easy see political debates medicine psychiatry process happens i pointed dynamic blog i also posted recent summary release dsm major source misinformation lies bullshit many examples psychiatry let barbarians gate get i tell aspiring physicians aspiring psychiatrists thing let detractors days trolls get psychiatry tough field always lot people blaming problems brandolini law really applies numerous dialogues web sites available game post much misinformation bullshit lies psychiatry particular entire web sites exist purpose entering discussion taking opposite side argument futile law suggests may take several orders magnitude effort even may futile best approach get information cyberspace independent forum know safely viewed one reasons blog exists internet still wild west probably never change current form williamson suggests may possible harness collective power internet improve quality suggests global scientific community reviewing sites rating like film rating sites i far less optimistic first problem scope project second would consistency ratings third rating sense legitimizing far better approach ignore ignorant reality reputation protection web sites basically work generating lot information designed bury obnoxious web site people find contact search engine web site may slandering met relatively hostile response complete lack interest correcting anything true even largest search engines google example clearly give damn reputation brandolini law significant deterrent keeping professionals engaged educating public physicians certainly find hurry decide post rebuttal political media forums populated ignorant trolls specific agenda true psychiatrists specialty dual effect limiting feedback might interested eliminating informed criticism also added effect adding professionals may legitimate criticism antipsychiatry web sites scientific criticism clearly agenda dangerous path least resistance legitimate professionals start posting web sites dedicated destruction profession ideas brandolini law i write important one always go grid even problems i talked psychiatrist years ago asked give presentations local churches depression eventually gave people audience various reasons disruptive prevented giving interested people information wanted psychiatrists could end heckled church bullshit presented person easily typed online williamson refers rising tide populism threatens future evidence based government i think ever evidence based government i see mostly power dynamic influencing people emotional ideas shouting reason brandolini law work reality case psychiatry end day still people severe mental illness matter tries deny group people called psychiatrists interested helping necessarily enough prevent widespread demoralization profession george dawson md dfapa reference phil williamson take time effort correct misinformation nature december supplementary brother saw post commented brandolini law never true i reflected true statement continued widespread ignorance science came following observation might made casey stengel good science cancels bullshit vice versa probably captures misinformation grows exponentially scientific information society levels playing field degree informed uniformed
