connection key guard abreaction produce genuine feelings two important factors play first patient must arrive particular feeling pain need untrammeled feelings often compounded history unrelenting pain childhood trauma neglect therapist must acutely aware leitmotif session feelings critical peripheral takes much experience know often tendency conflate feelings go wrong tangent wrong feeling addressed get abreaction example patient feeling suddenly starts gagging coughing result first line intrusion therapist steer back original feeling intrusion diversion diversion abreaction patient comes bitching wife suffocating me demands begins gagging know origin complaints deep brain likely part brainstem concerned breathing push patient birth trauma unless far along therapy ready experience otherwise steered back original feeling explore feels suffocated indeed thin line know level patient level access without unbearable pain true patient comes crying third line never goes beneath older pains abreaction discharging deeper feelings higher level brain function unable unwilling take back deeper result full feeling rather becomes chronic discharge energy feeling final resolution example patient may come cry film saw never connect life past experience stuck third line abreacting screaming yelling always remains simple discharge feeling ultimately means experience context problem yelling crying screaming context still feels good form groove relief gets tricky levels contexts ideas top level emotional experiences limbic system infantile brainstem level contexts deepen patient able go deeper therapy complete primal experience means encompassing three levels brain function involved single feeling comes later therapy access allows patient travel beginnings experience life allowed complete cycle feeling obtain resolution kind primal patient feels entire crucible behavior symptoms longer mystery long allow evolution job tempting sometimes therapist push patient something dramatic show called skill need know line level patient operating help focus avoids lange levels also prevents proper connection see patients wander several feelings disparate subjects single scattershot session nearly always patient wandering many subjects means lange great underlying pain pushing one place another needless say patient often suffers attention deficit reason strong primal force preventing focus feelings must felt levels orderly sequence therapist must get patient back track natural feeling allowed unfold tune natural resonance links levels feeling together neurologically patient right track resonance take course leading patient naturally deeper remote time abreaction often therapist leading patient wrong direction creating manner bad outcomes idea remain feeling zone zone connection take place outside primal zone integration possible helps therapist least modicum brain science disposal cases example know use tranquilizers help get patient zone time lieu therapy aid wrong feeling addressed therapist unresolved feelings tend drive patient needs go worse avoid feelings patient ready example anger therapist terrified hostility shut patient let patient go near feeling remain unresolved therapist criticized dodge blame try make error patient fault instead widespread problems therapists want avoid confining patient ideational cortex neglect feeling words want avoid precisely predominant therapeutic approach contemporary psychotherapy cognitive behavioral cognitivists really believe head changing thoughts change behavior me ideas signify something disembodied therapist lives world ideas much feeling one reason feelings seem secondary ideas agree paramount value contrast full feeling experience primal sense means confined neocortical level ideas intellect live hook primitive lower levels brain higher levels proper connection means historical need feeling pain fully experienced know real feeling taken place verify physiologically every session systematically measure vital signs patient real primal expect vital signs move pretty much together start back towards end session months constant normalization vital signs blood pressure heart rate body temp get reset normal range months therapy time also significant drop cortisol levels enhanced natural killer cells see book primal healing discussion measurable metabolic changes also include permanent one degree lowering body temperature since body temperature key factor longevity work bodies important index addition research found one year therapy systematic changes brain function toward harmonized cerebral system means getting pain undoing repression case abreaction feeling without context abreaction never kind organized coordinated movement vital functions instead random discharge energy feeling pain produce sporadic disorganized movement vital signs harmony system thus vital signs reflect integration sure connection never took place measures thinking feel actually real feeling neurologic worlds apart definition abreaction lacks connection sine qua non primal therapy without connection neither healing cure clearly crucial connection solidify feeling progress connection means patient feeling reliving connecting pain fear terror bit bit relives feels making connection something buried away perhaps years connection means feeling something context comprising different level aspect feeling patient arrives began eventually patients need go random scream cry take level feeling must connect context different descend chain pain brain level contributes specialty ideas feelings instincts hand abreaction release energy feeling without meaning context great gap reliving relieving mistake called mock therapists make time mistake easy make abreaction looks like feeling noted patient deliberately faking feeling abreaction real feeling sequence therefore curative allow proper connection across three levels natural orderly way patient pushed tributary feeling pain main feeling great heavy painful feeling therapy everyday life keeps focus concentration pushes away central feeling abreaction going motions feeling without depth history requires person perform sidetrack feeling relieving reliving connection means liberation feelings context scream writhe cry context exercise make profound change patient slowly descends deep levels time reacts stimuli events level neurological capabilities era progress goal therapy retrieve memory scene place also feelings belonging repressed held storage pain terror primal reaching deep physiologically part history sequestered decades give secrets easily sometimes patient yet ready experience remains mystery time right patients finally experience feelings totality including physiological aspects become integrated neurotic split healed person longer war use term holistic patient become whole every sense word feelings integrated awareness neurophysiology
