i spent four months exploring desktop bioinformatics overall i excited i able i optimistic prospects desktop science geeks tons great online tools bio sci lots important scientific questions yet fleshed i thought i share i learned provide pointers anyone might want try hand sort citizen science helps benefit science education particular bio education beginning one great things desktop science learn go example might bare bones basic understanding enzymology begin move deeper particular research quest find wanting learn aspect enzyme hit google scholar bring date detail particular subject good thing i first plunged dna analysis i admit knowledge mitochondria weak i knew dna example obvious me i started digging mitochondrial dna pathetically small whereas mitochondrial proteome superset products go making functioning mitochondrion large words mitochondrial genes mtdna nuclear dna couple online databases nuclear mitochondrial genes numts known large area dire need research someone needs put together database reference set yeast numts example also need database algal numts another protozoan numts another rice corn arabidopsis numts etc maybe one move project along get started desktop bioinformatics i recommend familiarizing great tools genomevolution org powered iplant turn funded national science foundation plant cyberinfrastructure program particular i recommend set aside evening run tutorials genomevolution org give idea possible tools many organisms genes flagellum proteins organisms actually make flagellum flagellum whiplike appendage gives cell motility bdellovibrio bacterium powerful flagellum go page scroll find really interesting short videos showing use genomevolution org tools fun watch stimulate imagination kinds problems need investigating desktop biologists sky limit one quest lends citizen science looking examples horizontal gene transfer hgt requires first teach little bit blast searches blast searches sequence similarity searches let compare dna dna amino acid sequence amino acid sequence strategies involved range simple brute force sophisticated great thing invent heuristics wide open area i recently found good evidence similarity dna sequences bacterial gene transfer rice i write later post i confident thousands examples horizontal gene transfer whether bacteria bacteria bacteria plant bacteria insect whatever waiting discovered could easily next discoverer one gene transfers ideas desktop science explorations find characterize flagellar genes organisms lack motility dig literature find many examples supposedly immotile organisms like intracellular parasite buchnera lives inside aphids harbor flagellum genes express yet external flagellum obviously organisms retain flagellum genes actually make flagellum little whip like tail makes single celled organisms swim around must retaining genes reason gene products must something also paramecium diatoms eukaryotes make flagella cilia animals also make cilia ever get tickle deep throat bronchia probably something tangling cilia lining bronchial system relationship cilia gene products paramecium say cilia animals plants conceal cilia genes related phylogenetically lower organism cilia migration genes parasites host dna general pattern seems happen nature bacterium invader takes residency inside animal plant cell becoming endosymbiont genes symbiont genes move nucleus host cell genes genes try find bidirectionally bidi transcribed genes rare examples genes strand dna transcribed mrna genome rothia mucilaginosa contains many putative examples find organisms contain bidi genes try determine strands actually transcribed examine sister species organisms see one strand transcribed one organism gene strand transcribed organism phylogenetics plasmid viral genes try determine ancestry virus gene good tree making services online hard work including protein sequence alignments cut paste fasta files codon analysis many plants rice one higher organisms dna less equally divided high gc content genes low gc content genes surely codon usage patterns class genes varies codon adaptation indexes cai values various genes create histograms cai values use cais techniques try determine genes highly expressed hegs highly expressed genes mostly high gc low gc run histograms genes purine content content content codon position many organisms organelles extremely gc poor genomes bizarre codon usage patterns say codon aaa used times average codon use fewer codons possible find organelle organism uses fewest codons see organism organelle uses fewer amino acids amino acids gets left characterize dna repairosome aerobic anerobic archeon compare contrast two find genes particular organism mitochondrial targeting presequences dna pick two closely related organisms try figure many million years ago diverged use mitochondrial dna analysis well cytoplasmic protein analysis find bacterium secretion protein permease protein translocation genes compare closest relative find organism pathogenic humans animals plants find closest non pathogenic relative compare genomes determine genes likely involved virulence seemingly simple organisms amoebae dna human dna contain horizontally transferred genes plants bacteria archeons animals amoebas super large genome organisms dna hoarders dna curationists characterize genes enumerate category first organisms many expressed many junk energy cost maintaining much junk dna junk amoeba actually devolved higher life form forgot morphogenesis longer develop tadpole whatever
