still following earlier post i working way philosophically chris frith latest book making mind post i consider frith attribution psychological properties brain chapters account neurological cause hallucinatory experience chapter particular rather curious theory 'even senses intact brain functioning normally direct access physical world may feel direct access illusion created brain chapter spoil story i begin i suggesting frith strictly incoherent attribution psychological properties brain rather person hacker 'mereological fallacy always big problem often cash metaphors impetus behind bizzarre propositions 'our direct access physical world illusion created brain sort instead principally provided colluding tacitly 'homunculuar view mind self consciousness lies receiving end kind inner witness deliverances neurological processes strike confused metaphysics including without warrant 'objectifies mentality intentional relations environment redescribed domain inner objects neuropsychological facts seen warrant far mundane description carry striking epistemological implications frith text would believe chapter aims show 'damaged brain prevent finding world also create minds experience world entirely false i doubt anyone would surprised idea brain damage might lead hallucination illusion i sha spend much time looking chapter findings i want first note colluding force 'mereological 'homuncular 'objectifying conceptual fallacies text mereological homuncular objectifying fallacies p 'just like video recorder eyes ears pick information physical world transmit
