i started writing blog three years ago i decided start writing number reasons first foremost constant stream inappropriate criticism aimed psychiatry contrasted real life experience working field working competent colleagues field second reason strike back managed care various forms i would include today pharmacy benefit managers government bureaucracies even politicians individuals organizations continue promote institutionalize rationing strategies supposed cost effective basically route hundreds billions dollars away patient care unnecessary business managers third reason disproportionate impact first two patient care care patients psychiatric problems decimated mindset hypercritical ignorant psychiatric care time rationing resources point incarcerations commonplace even person serious problem gains entry system care guarantee receive administrators expertise make critical decisions whether hospitalized whether get detoxification services medication take intensively seen clinics whether get additional supportive services need related fourth issue even though systems care define dangerousness essentially reason people need hospitalized days poor job assessing treating needs addressed public health level well aggressive homicidal behavior associated mental illness needs systematically addressed rather swept rug stigmatizing teaching something i good i take informational rather process based approach i post likely high information content unique rather entertaining area i wide interests field apply patient care theory i post scientific articles clinical strategies i hope clinically useful colleagues many cases already vetted fellow psychiatrists human consciousness related issue i think essentially ignored modern psychiatry i post examples consciousness works peoples basic matrix i working points i observed might useful information potential psychiatric bloggers follows nobody really cares blog blogs dime dozen everyone writes one days initial goal getting viewpoint people interested additional corollary psychiatry order maximize readership odds better criticizing field provocative rather debunking lot unrealistic criticism i hope clear i writing matter keep long i care happens psychiatrists physicians patients i continue know exactly problems far i tell little perspective available blogosphere press even editorial section professional specialty journals thirty years practicing medicine saps creativity physicians realize i heard many actually come say i fairly skilled writer one point least according undergrad professors tens thousands pages medical documentation later much meaningless bullet points added administrative purposes mind numbing exercise taken toll physicians consider writing burden reason prose become obsessive times thanks electronic health record grammatically incorrect i fortunate regular reader send me corrections ideas improve greatly appreciate advice medical schools select bright creative people become physicians medical schools unconcerned deterioration practice environment stifles creativity dumbs medical practice disservice medical students select qualities ignoring haters never really big problem mine discover substantial number people dislike psychiatrists reasons irrational easy ignore initial mistake allowing several posts onto blog i rejected i seen happens threads blogs irrational corrosive opinion allowed persist guise freedom speech freedom criticize collegial atmosphere i ever trained allowed rational criticism delivered manner acceptable everyone post sent direction i think would fly meeting physicians see light day good example would attempting post i drug company whore inappropriate first also wildly inaccurate notorious critics clearly know psychiatrists glaring deficits scholarship subject inclined ethical arguments i would argue unethical allow serious discussion trained medical experts disrupted people basically disruptive nothing else offer ignoring numbers always difficult figure blogger statistics mean vary factor day day basis cases i gotten page views less one minute doubt represent anything real many cases referring urls clearly spam sites originate countries youth encouraged become hackers steal money foreigners occasional referrals sites seem legitimate like valid educational sites i get excited statistics aggregate parsed anybody reading sense solidarity statements goals whether say good enough me analyze rhetoric one consistent dynamics observed criticized branch medicine handled total lack accountability part critics course say whatever want often loudly proclaim right inevitable group hero worshipers back like new insights fact collection vague inaccurate observations cling like know something medicine science real experts uncritically lend credence wall ideas one leading authors area book endorsed editor critical psychiatry seem much different coalescing around concepts intelligent design science even rational analysis understanding rhetoric prevents one falling trap save maybe patient much heat comes psychiatric criticism flows business ethical problems pharmaceutical companies associated physician conflict interest entire blogs seems topic interest one blogs claimed keeping psychiatry honest implied claim sites complete transparency drug trials contact physicians industry lead new idyllic state completely safe effective drugs maybe also able stop studying neuroscience hearken back psychotherapies psychosocial interventions ideas naive i could barely stand type line thinking completely ignores corrupt elephant room congress fact fda clearly politically influenced point ignore recommendations scientific committees put drug market want ignores fact american governments pro business detriment individual corporations readily accept model paying civil penalties reasonable risk pushing business envelope also greatly ignores fact psychiatrists really minor players pharmaceutical medical device industry nobody press seems worried appears little solidarity among physicians physicians divided decades splitting political factors specialties also within specialty i think part fuels cultural norm criticizing colleagues even though vast majority good work apparent appearance ethical problems see post monolithic psychiatry rhetoric i think critical component scholarship also frequently ignored adopt posture criticism equivalent criticism within field me falsely modest position rounding physicians clearly well read associated clinical experience medicine something learn reading snippets internet i know widespread knowledge physicians actively managed maintain fractioned state productivity units first introduced managers everywhere suggested tremendous variation productivity physicians pulling weight everyone measured pilloried production every month apparent lie better way foster every man woman attitude destroy semblance professional solidarity let me say future reference management physicians really psychological warfare physicians motivation strategies varied certainly benign ethical climate well ethical climate part business manufacturing news headlines includes constructing ethical climate applying people criticized generally set ups provocative articles seem scandalous fact ethics debatable debates typically one sided best way win argument successfully smear opponent many ethical environments straw men set psychiatrists clear physician broken law medical practice rules state constitutes proof wrongdoing i lost count times i referred people medical board complaining physician generally marks end discussion seem expectation publicly shaming physician ridicule means something mean anything me physician professional organizations weak ineffective i year member apa ama prevent me criticizing organizations recognizing shortcomings psychiatry organizations different ama physician organizations ineffective area mental health policy especially countering managed care tactics ration restrict care longer advocate state art care i recently critiqued guideline clear trained psychiatrist use said supported good initiatives like banning participation psychiatrists torture resumption clinical guidelines i committed speak apa positions i think problematic like support american board psychiatry neurology abpn position recertification collaborative care use rating scales establish quality care parameters participation managed care entities establish guidelines quality parameters apa far establishing criteria inpatient care psychiatric addiction problems actively critical proprietary guidelines facilitate rationing care commonest distortion apa ama kind power influence politicians businesses run medicine country nothing farther truth developments field important psychiatric literature better point lifetime lot clinical trials current state clinical trials seems like dead end me due primarily lack sophistication certain buzzwords like evidence based medicine controlled clinical trials collaborative care coopted non physicians point often meaningless i critiqued massive medicare guideline included page description evidence necessary basic documentation addition literature excellent educational conferences widely available across country people often lose sight fact life clinical trial clinical method faster probably safer clinical trials real proposed necessarily best use time energy trying creative creative commentary creative writing possible part tradition psychiatry i added things along way illustrate important concepts non technical way i trying add graphics pieces also illustrate stream consciousness concepts either mine somebody else supporting bloggers i quite happy support psychiatrists bloggers bloggers i consider useful sources information blogosphere immense i sure i missed people i try include list blogs i follow consult list regularly psychiatrist i encourage start blog find voice add i familiar work hundreds psychiatrists midwest know opinion reflects opinion many experience experience know psychiatrists deal impossible problems minimal resources put obnoxious administrators managed care bureaucrats still get good results patients add voice realistic information psychiatry internet i doubt regret staying non commercial bloggers encouraged add commercials cases make money blogging seems like potential conflict interest me especially marketing additional products like books cds speaker fees espouse personal viewpoints good may allow appreciation like attract paying customers including needs said manner said also laboratory forces similar corrupting influences business world affect delivery health care either way influence blog content many posters seem view blogs method advertising attempt design posts bring readers sources advertising i think makes sense avoid avoid advertising like avoid talking pharmaceutical company sales staff carefully consider reading blog trying sell products paying attention things hopefully keep me track keep me posting really going psychiatry well information useful psychiatrists physicians trainees anyone really interested topics i enough megalomaniac believe i change trends i attending i let slip without realistic commentary i say george dawson md dfapa
