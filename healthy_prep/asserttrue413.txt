know double stranded dna number purines always equal number pyrimidines complementarity depends pairings purines equal pyrimidines single stranded dna chargaff second parity rule says yes simple observation says suppose couple thousand single stranded dna samples see chargaff second rule correct create graph versus point represents adenine thymine amounts particular dna sample predicted chargaff graph look like straight line slope fun i grabbed sequenced dna genome clostridium botulinum strain atcc available fasta link page ready several megabyte text dump contains coding sequences genes average length bases gene i plotted content versus content plot thymine versus adenine content genes botulinum coding regions greyed area represents areas genes fall white area see resulting cloud points form straight line slope even cluster degree line center cluster well degree line amazing part major axis cluster almost degrees degree line indicating quantity tends conserved similar plot versus shows somewhat different scatter pattern notice centroid cluster well degree centerline means chargaff second rule hold except genes randomly fell centerline plot cytosine versus guanine genes coding regions botulinum notice points cluster well away degree line would expected cluster according chargaff numbers bases type botulinum genome amazingly adenines thymines genome i somewhat sloppily equating genome combined coding regions likewise excess guanines number average gene contains excess purines adenine guanine graphs way unique botulinum similar plots organisms see similar results excess purines numerous organisms low content explained earlier posts subject purine pyrimidine ratio coding regions tends high low gc organisms low high gc organisms relationship holds across bacterial eukaryotic domains
