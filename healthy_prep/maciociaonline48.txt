types meat also source heat wild meats also hot pheasant grouse rabbit deer elk reindeer wild boar etc apart foods spices also source heat mace ginger curry cumin chilly etc external pathogenic factor penetrating interior external pathogenic factor frequently penetrates interior expelled exterior stage happens every external pathogenic factor tendency change heat thus even wind cold turn heat interior indeed exactly happens stages patterns shang han lun tai yang stage characterized wind cold transform yang ming stage stomach heat course external wind heat summer heat even stronger tendency turn interior heat i find aetiology internal full heat actually quite common especially lung heat many people suffer invasion wind heat wind heat expelled exterior stage may go interior turn lung heat lung phlegm heat likely happen antibiotics resorted called residual heat i heat left invasion wind heat common children type lung heat often symptomless tongue shows clearly redness red points front
