i pretend architect sometimes i wonder apis starting point product development rather afterthought yesterday i suggested thing middleware api maturity model intentional api design would one middle levels i think fact i know possible better possible make api design sharp edge wedge software development new concept joshua bloch others advocated early design apis rather letting apis trail product design currently practiced early design i mean apis literally written first software lot software development happens way course draw uml diagrams identify key interfaces write mock methods etc writing real code fine quite defining api api first design means identifying defining key actors personas determining actors personas expect able apis i possible use cases user narratives stories encapsulate business problems people need solve important trying understand mental model actor brings problem space mental model drive architectural design decisions various levels example suggest kinds business objects user thinks terms keep overall process track toward good usability necessary overspecify api outset way products overspecified requirements stage begin writing mock code immediately nice thing writing api find quickly whether serving needs learn holes means api first design process degree self guiding overspecified api enemy end constrain user funny ways use api core development constrain developers brings important reason consider api first design get tool creating product developers end using api write product early api mocks basis unit tests downstream costs adding api later already core api finally delivered customers capabilities thoroughly tested r team used build product top level fictional middleware api maturity model thing existed doubt nirvana level called api driven design characterized well known dogfood pattern tm consume api part everything build vendors practice greater lesser extent already start strategy api first design degree api reuse high indeed i know couple r organizations aggressively systematically applying api first design methodology right i feeling number grow good idea
