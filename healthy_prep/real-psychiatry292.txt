one reasons i like listening public radio provide lot clinicopathological case material usually quite illustrative frees me huge hurdle suspected disclosing confidential patient information blog note historical context i started deidentified clinical information mainstay teaching presented case conferences medical journals point became lot less likely opinion adversely affects teaching way could dangerous health patient best physicians depend pattern matching recognize diseases many patterns recalled live patients also pictures images numbers remembered independent real contact live patient administrator allow me use deidentified mri scan images teaching residents residents end knowing little bit less terms book learning terms experiential aspects medicine unique technical skill physician nobody else access vast array patterns experienced medical school post graduate training i driving around today listening public radio show came called radiolab i heard interesting tried present science interesting ways many cases involves medicine today show choices i happened pick way roughly minute mark point antoine bechara md phd began discussing case elliot young accountant elliot working corporation successful upper level manager married children considered smart successful religious one day small tumor discovered orbitofrontal cortex successfully removed post surgical neuropsychological testing showed still th percentile terms iq testing returned home went back work occurred following successful neurosurgery unexpected longer able make even routine decisions example tried decide pen use sign contract took minutes decide whether use black pen blue pens possible permutations decision explored evenly considered case many choices available program used

way seen behavioral neurologist antonio damasio md phd tested visual stimuli designed elicit strong emotional responses visual stimuli failed elicit responses patient damage orbitofrontal cortex

complex hard imagine methods would allow isolation correlation systems suggested clinical vignette patient brain tumor neuroanatomy also complex many taught consider supraorbital area frontal cortex typical frontal cortex turns medial gyri represent vmpfc appropriately considered limbic cortex looking recent post involvement nucleus accumbens decision making provides two avenues advancing decisions emotions reward pushing decisions forward apart psychiatric disorders addictions brain systems profound implications everyday life illusion free many biases everyday life many would deny may product reward emotional valence assigned string associations mechanisms many biases unconscious i think widespread confusion emotions compromise objectivity rational decision making one main outcomes
