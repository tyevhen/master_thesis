interesting somewhat mysterious aspect biodiversity relative proportions bases dna take wildly different values different organisms even though making many proteins i referring fact guanine plus cytosine content dna vary streptomyces species less certain bacterial endosymbionts even free living bacteria clostridium botulinum remarkably dna tiny bacterium buchnera aphidicola distantly related coli entered symbiotic partnership aphid around million years ago gc content making dna look almost like two letter code occasional many genome reduced endosymbionts lost dna repair enzymes true mitochondria incidentally thought arisen symbiosis ancient ancestor today alphabproteobacteria loss repair capability could well explain much gc shift seen endosymbiont genomes left dna tends accumulate oxo guanine residues incorrectly pair thymine result gc ta transversions dna replication time whatever causes gc reduction left many organisms severely enriched dna organisms question still able encode perfectly functional proteins even limited nucleic acid vocabulary i decided might interesting try visualize gc diversity creating heat map hot colors cool colors certain genes occur across bacteria example following graphic heat map gc usage gene thymidine kinase occurs different organisms genomic ranging thymidine kinase gene bacteria widely varying genomic gc percentages guanine cytosine represented hot colors adenine thymine cool colors alignments done mega software via clustalw using relatively permissive gap opening penalty gap extension penalty heat map created javascript using canvas api create map i obtained dna sequences thymidine kinase organisms using excellent online tools uniprot org genomevolution org aligned mega drew colors red red orange blue blue green corresponding bases using canvas api looking rows data one row per gene also say per organism gaps created alignment shown grey several things apparent graphic aside obvious fact gc usage indicated red orange tends high genes organisms like brachybacterium faecium top line gc low bottom chart organisms like clostridium perfringens strain atcc gc ureaplasma urealyticum first high gc genes tend somewhat longer indeed upper right see longest genes opened sizable alignment gap extends whole graphic also genes differ substantially leader trailer sequences although i think really seeing least part inaccurate annotation start stop codons interesting me way certain gc regions trail way bottom graph others fade blue i think could argued nucleotides represented red blips final lines graph bottom positions gene strong functional constraints would interesting test positions evidence selection pressure could argued areas low selection pressure turned blue time get bottom graph i think also interesting several red orange clusters right midpoint three quarters way graph disappear new red orange zone begins appear left around way certain gc mutations one protein domain led gc mutations another domain upstream side graph left right getting many genes divergent sources align easy though setting gap open penalty clustalw low value aligning genes small batches row row need technical aside i first tried creating graph using svg scalable vector graphics burden creating separate dom node every pixel amounts way much browser handle firefox choked chrome i quickly switched canvas api puts heavy dom burdens browser convert fasta formatted alignment file nice picture two seconds worth names organisms whose genes appeared graphic arranged order gc content kinase gene whole
