ordinary people knew qe quantitative easing worked might riots streets thoroughly ludicrous welfare plan rich trillion wall street banks remained ledgers reserves nothing show except stock market bubble mainly benefits upper class prevented worse recession one knows know qe sustainable tactic longer term next crash need something far better put money average person pocket update fed admits qe worsens inequality zerohedge let sort plain english weird thing called qe fancy name federal reserve technique pumping money economy accurately bond market banks reserves work fed buys treasury obligations sometimes mortgage backed securities banks usually via primary dealers primary dealers complete list shown includes jp morgan securities goldman sachs etc wall street investment banks need qe evidently capitalism able fix problems organically free markets functioned properly need interventions amounting trillions dollars qe emergency measure using qe instead something else fed able control velocity money via direct manipulation federal funds rate key interest rate meltdown fed went zero interest fed funds economy pick zero interest ineffective fed realized money supply shrinking due banks making loans recall debtors pay back loans money destroyed banks make new loans money created creation new money nothing printing presses accounting trick made possible fractional reserve banking fed decided buy mortgages treasury obligations banks allow banks increase reserves theory promotes lending reality mostly results banks carrying higher reserves fed ca force bank customers borrow money hence qe indirect tool best alternatives qe fed main tools monetary nature qe money supply interest rate adustments traditional alternative fiscal intervention tax reductions federal stimulus programs expansion government programs government spending hear word fiscal think tax spend current political environment meaningful fiscal action difficult achieve slow qe quick requires passage new laws qe actually accomplish qe many indirect effects main direct effect qe bid bond prices sending yields lower treasury instruments yield less interest investors seeking higher return rates move bonds lower quality corporate bonds common stock instruments basically stock market gets boost benefits theory money enters banking system businesses consumers better able borrow money results economic expansion reality one already maxed going borrow money interest rates low corporations mainly using excess cash including borrowed money expand businesses buy back stock compensate executives largely stock rising stock market mainly benefits upper class since richest americans stock people equate qe printing money printing presses involved qe term printing money derogatory yet useful figure speech qe successful banks make loans money supply rises people equate printing money literally accurate difference qe qe qe three qe programs since first qe involved mortgage backed assets well government bonds part effort strengthen banks post effective enough new round qe initiated program ended june shortly thereafter fed initiated operation twist program selling short term treasury obligations using money thus raised buy longer term bonds trick achieving qe net cost essentially arguably effective making home mortgage market pick september still happy economy fed announced third round qe provided open ended commitment purchase billion per month agency mortgage backed securities labor market improves substantially open ended nature program called qe infinity fact qe program ended october much money spent buy back bonds fed acquired trillion worth mortgages bonds course three qe rounds england spent around billion manner european central bank committed trillion euro program qe note comparison entire federal budget trillion happens securities fed may hold bonds bills notes mature may decide sell others back market latter would cause interest rates go stock market go happens federal deficit qe represents arm government fed buying back federal debt hence unlike fiscal stimulus programs qe debt neutral deficit go may actually go reducing interest payouts would otherwise go private bond holders ways qe similar corporation buying back stock although accurate analogy would course corporation buying back bonds qe worth still finding experts say many goals qe achieved critics point economic benefits qe accrued mostly wall street upper class even proponents qe surprised sums money required move needle also denying global economy still suffers sluggish demand reflected example sagging commodity prices poor gdp growth uk europe risks associated qe uncharted territory one ever pumped trillions dollars economy short period time critics qe say current market valuations artificially high due qe experts worry post qe period entering least lead poor liquidity increasing market volatility flight bonds outright shorting bonds happened europe may concern europe ecb run bonds buy within year problem one ever introduced large distortion securities markets know downstream effects might qe cause inflation actually see article details inflation problem qe means increasing reserves banking system printing money usual sense happens another crash attitude wall street seems another crash ca happen soon since one silly obviously critics say qe caused asset bubble could pop time leading period deleveraging deflation deep recession qe ultimately proves failure crash occurs governments resort something effective meaningful fiscal intervention probably impossible political reasons one idea started get fair amount attention authorizing fed make low cost loans directly households instead banks causing money enter economy directly via consumers fed currently authority structuring payments loans would equivalent qe accounting perspective would add national debt forgiving loans would equivalent making direct cash payments citizens would add federal deficit unless paid taxes direct loans central banks households often called helicopter money would next logical step disaster relief arguably something fed done already since qe currently conceived mostly benefitted banks upper class required outrageous quantities funds achieve rather modest short term effects longer term implications known found article helpful please share
