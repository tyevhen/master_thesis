source shortened vesion nature neuroscience blog ever since functional double dissociation also dorsal dhpc ventral hippocampus vhpc lot research focused mainly dhpc spatial memory processing however less research done ventral portion region known largely charge mediating anxiety like behaviors interesting findings presented poster floor society neuroscience i pleasure see posters relate anxiety brain region emerging story vhpc interacts closely prefrontal cortex regulate anxiety behaviors oscillatory pattern known theta rhythm whereby amygdala also plays crucial role along vta synchronized rhythm multiple brain areas regions coordinate neural communication read poster info brain regions diagrams i made pretty professional second day sfn i stopped three interesting posters related general theme i cover two space limited hopefully post either blog two interesting ones gordon lab columbia first poster likhtik examined three areas involved fear related behaviors ability discriminate predict neutral aversive situations inability discriminate situations contexts lead anxiety thus generalized response fear threat svev mice local field potentials recorded vhpc mpfc dhpc basolateral nucleus amygdala bla single unit recordings taken bla mice learnt discriminate stimulus leads shock cs one cs mice good learning discriminating two stimuli others poorer mice good discrimination showed great increase theta rhythm presented cs aversive stimulus compared cs neutral safe stimulus animals great discrimination showing equal freezing stimuli show difference theta power compared baseline condition stim i found really cool animals subsequently good discrimination task handling mice discriminator mice higher theta coupling bla mpfc compared animals good discrimination generalizers taking step found correlation freezing coupling mpfc bla vhpc dhpc though also lends support behavioral double dissociation mentioned top post guessed handling discriminators still higher theta synchrony three regions even handling compared generalizers using fancy algorithms stuff i understand able determine flow theta activity occurred appears baseline stim mpfc sets tempo leads theta activity reaching bla time aversive stimulus cs presented bla seems lead theta rhythm flow mpfc generalizers though safe stimulus cs get pattern bla leads mpfc theta whereas case discriminators generalizers seem sending generalization signals whereas discriminators better thresh holding theta activity flow upon taking look flow information vhpc mpfc appears vhpc sends information mpfc baseline stimulus presentation makes sense given vhpc mpfc directionality seems uni directional mentioned i envisaged leading theta i viewing poster picture courtesy ms paint l r glover designs second poster presented aadhikari examined whether svev mice synchronization medial prefrontal cortex mpfc specifically prelimbic area vhpc distinguish safe aversive areas elevated plus maze epm epm elevated ground common behavioral apparatus used induce stress anxiety behaviors rodents consists two closed arms safe arms maze high walls surround mouse avoid falling whereas open arms wall less small walls order promote anxiety fear height order explore whether areas could distinguish safe aka closed arms averse aka open arms recorded multiple mpfc neurons simultaneously monitoring via local field potentials vhpc responds find mpfc neurons distinguish arms regardless whether open closed mpfc neurons fired closed arms began decrease firing rate mouse transition open arm units fired preferentially open arms started decrease firing upon transitioning closed arm enters vhpc find mpfc neurons respond strongly either set arms also highly coupled theta activity vhpc direction vhpc mpfc signalling shown uni directional terms mice behaved epm find animals tended avoid open arms less i repeat less mpfc neurons distinguished arm types heck would animals avoid open arms less mpfc neurons distinguish two types arms counter intuitive science usually interestingly overall firing rate avoidant mice tended stay closed arms higher rates less avoidant mice answer given form quite possible mpfc neurons respond strongly closed arms generalized open closed arms thereby increasing total firing rate would appear would distinguishing neurons fire equally open closed arms wildly picture courtesy ms paint l r glover designs back team additional experiments hta receptor knockout mice modified epm brightly lit arms aversive stimulus height sake brevity i leave first poster avoidant mice could say good discriminators warning dangerous environment signal activated spread throughout mpfc neurons make appear distinguish arms really second poster see directionality flow presentation threatening cue bla signals threat sends information vhpc relayed mpfc tie together vhpc appears pick signal danger anxious state expected based previous behavioral work message sent uni directionally mpfc via high synchronous coupling bla vhpc mpfc mpfc neurons discriminate environment safe aversive zones normally however mpfc gets danger signal theta rhythm coupling vhpc increased firing occurs mpfc neurons aversive prefering neurons mice poor discriminating threatening situations called generalizers appear information flow almost backwards thereby generalizing contexts i think flow i think mpfc bla work together define aversive vs safe information supplied sent vhpc checking state maybe signal conflict occurs assign specific context signal receiving passed onto mpfc cycle continues information goes studies tell i saw posters related information vta regions entire brain network part influences part fascinating
