consider psychoanalytic theory freud offers paranoia nuce paranoid beliefs others harbouring hostile intent towards one caused projection onto one hostile feelings toward oneself i find anger myself utterly intolerable keep overwhelmed shame incongruence terror i instead attribute anger i longer intolerable tear myself apart anger myself great inside relocated outside unfortunately i populated world hostile projections world becomes frightening also makes me angrily resentful damn hostile me least simple projection based understanding paranoia might also offer alternative dynamic explicate least forms namely live delusional sense retaliatory anger arises unconscious anger awakened me particular complex particular transference dynamic particular unconscious phantasy two people i locked intractable angry retaliatory battle one another yet i left conscious touch feelings towards me thought me able acknowledge anger much would reclaimed rather would simply fuelling phantasy retaliatory hostility provoked projection different non dynamic sense first theory projection type one involves motivated misattribution projection type two involves misreading along lines fearful phantasy

reading situations several things i take issue bentall account first i say mainly thoughtful cognitive psychologists accepted notion delusion explanation whilst phenomenologists psychoanalysts thoughtful instead seeing delusions rationalisations explanations motivationally rather rationally intelligible i bring relief rationally making sense things often strikingly fail locating
