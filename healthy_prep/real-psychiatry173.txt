i like idea getting dna analyzed studying results earlier post i described results analysis national geographic project finding dna neanderthals ability sequence ancient dna relatively new capability years done yielded number significant findings applicability field psychiatry limited time references additional search ancient dna psychiatry yields additional references looking early origins mutation associated disrupted regulatory mechanisms could lead psychopathology one susceptibility markers schizophrenia dates back last glacial maximum years bce trying national geographic site i decided see andme site anything offer i pulled web site paid fee sent me sampling kit sampling technology different use tube saliva sample rather scraping buccal mucosa send number mail updates finally notification dna processed necessary reports generated reports focus ancestry carrier status wellness traits reports useful others example interesting th digit hand longer second digit second toe longer great toe inherited characteristics certain probabilities unless additional health implications involved i really care longest toe finger data i looking precisely data fda told andme market first place initial fda warning looks testing company offering document abbreviation pgs used personal genome service uses pgs intended particularly concerning assessments brca related genetic risk drug responses warfarin sensitivity clopidogrel response fluorouracil toxicity potential health consequences could result false positive false negative assessments high risk indications instance brca related risk assessment breast ovarian cancer reports false positive could lead patient undergo prophylactic surgery chemoprevention intensive screening morbidity inducing actions false negative could result failure recognize actual risk may exist i sure plenty posts around internet regulatory aspects dna testing fda protect american public andme consistent qualifying statements saying none data medical purposes research education interest purely personal research education i learn dna genetics molecular biology human diseases noted original i learn ancestry fascinating subject paleogenetics associated big questions like homo sapiens genus species current human beings surviving homo genus others extinct i also think quite instructive remind members species started east africa migrated world looking test results me analysis four major categories useful others categories include ancestry traits carrier status wellness since ancestry focus national geographic experiment i took look report first terms methodology me technology looks overlapping regions dna homology comparison regions known ethnic groups i prepared following table look predictive value andme approach compared national geographic technique looking purported ancestries grandparents click graphic enlarge noted table coverage ethnicities using andme approach best example picks norwegian swedish dutch markers present natgeo analysis problems might obvious first test subject complete information ethnicities populations origin may incorporated algorithm assigns probabilities certain ancestry questions reminded me clinical data required quantitative electroencephalogram machines algorithms supposed predict psychiatric diagnoses clinical data required every test frequently interfered machine going select i take dim view appear scientific decisions made basis added speculative data ancestry interpretations also depend level confidence assigned analysis example take look following genealogy assessments top conservative estimate bottom much speculation significant changes analysis occur based speculative analysis things considered i quite interested range analysis correlations point rather precision cases precision apparently available together ancestry reports interesting report me neanderthal analysis test looks traits across genome generates report based map chromosomes table takes detailed look several markers traits report significantly less interesting me answered question whether genetic markers trait existed example length second toe foot length fourth finger hand testing predicts i chance lighter skin little chance freckling true carrier status similarly interesting major focus congenital illness rather risk chronic illness carrier states mentioned include arsacs agenesis corpus callosum peripheral neuropathyaccpn autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease arpkd others carrier status relatively rare conditions negative really surprise considering age family history fact illnesses infancy childhood wellness section contained reports moderately interesting caffeine consumption regulated variants near cypa ahr genes i variants prevalence variants various populations also estimated seem variants high i tend consume significant amounts caffeine hardly noticeable seems like i drinking decaffeinated beverages i rs variant ada gene associated deep sleep i sleep short periods time activity monitor suggests sleep may deeper people sleep hours i also rs variant btbd gene predicts movement sleep rx variant actn gene present associated greater portion fast twitch muscle fibers site refers sprinter power muscle type final two wellness traits lactose intolerance alcohol flushing reaction i knew i neither trait prior genetic testing apart neanderthal testing interesting aspect service ability search genome looking points interest i think eventually interesting aspect services long users keep mind genotype especially complex polygenic illness probability statement rather guarantee i testing two ways searches first strategy based protein analysis i used recent paper bipolar disorder i strong family history see i could find markers original paper suggests higher plasma concentrations proteins bipolar disorder including gdf hpx hpn mmp rbp ttr direct search yields significant number hits hpx hpn ttr genes specific information markers genomic position possible variants genotype case original paper protein analysis far i tell genetic analysis subgroup higher levels identified proteins i sent mail lead author see i missed
