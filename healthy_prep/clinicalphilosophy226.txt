objects something called 'consciousness directed towards iii two types objects mental physical objects 'metaphysical dualism iv look around conceptually see find mental objects think 'substance dualist two types things minds bodies think ca say mental things physical things 'under different mental description call 'property dualism seems me people deny position regarding cfs dualist denying explicitly hold substance dualism whereas seems me accusation dualism usually amounts context broader one metaphysical dualism mentalism typically involves metaphysical dualist i suppose psychological
