auto immune diseases chinese medicine view autoimmune diseases comprise large number diseases different one another common ones see clinic multiple sclerosis systemic lupus erithematosus sle rheumatoid arthritis sjogren syndrome hashimoto thyroiditis graves disease crohn disease chinese medicine single explanation autoimmune pathology obviously ancient chinese medicine could view immune system one course use chinese identification patterns diseases treat successfully really explain autoimmune pathology whether common thread treatment diseases example treat hashimoto thyroiditis successfully without reference autoimmune disease however single underlying pathology autoimmune diseases common thread treatment chinese medicine perspective clear me need treat autoimmune disease individually according pathology aetiology patterns irrespective fact autoimmune disease however go step underlying common treatment autoimmune diseases present article endeavour answer questions autoimmune diseases western medicine autoimmune disorder condition occurs immune system mistakenly attacks destroys healthy body tissue perceiving non self different types autoimmune disorders normally immune system white blood cells help protect body antigens bacteria viruses toxins cancer cells blood tissues another person species immune system produces antibodies destroy harmful substances patients autoimmune disorder immune system perceives body tissues antigens attacks result immune response destroys normal body tissues response hypersensitivity reaction similar response allergic conditions allergies immune system reacts outside substance normally would ignore autoimmune disorders immune system reacts normal body tissues would normally ignore causes immune system longer tell difference healthy body tissues antigens unknown one theory microorganisms bacteria viruses drugs may trigger changes especially people genes make likely get autoimmune disorders possibility microorganisms might trigger pathology auto immunity interesting i believe latent heat often root autoimmune diseases moreover view immunizations lot development latent heat autoimmune disorder may result destruction one types body tissue abnormal growth organ changes organ function autoimmune disorder may affect one organ tissue types organs tissues commonly affected autoimmune disorders include blood vessels connective tissues endocrine glands thyroid pancreas joints muscles red blood cells skin person may one autoimmune disorder time symptoms symptoms autoimmune disease vary enormously based disease location abnormal immune response symptoms often occur autoimmune diseases include fatigue fever general ill feeling malaise chinese perspective three symptoms could symptoms yin fire latent heat discussing possible interpretation autoimmune diseases chinese perspective i would like discuss chinese medicine correspondent immune system put differently parts chinese vital substances functions influence immune system components immune system chinese medicine wei ying blood kidney yin yang bone marrow yuan jing stomach spleen would easy identify function immune system yang function protection immune cells constantly moving hunting antigens would wrong whole humoral part immune system relies blood yin wei common misconception attribute immune response wei natural since indeed protective defensive protects exterior pathogenic factors following chinese ideogram wei inside part phonetic wei two outer parts together xing i move separately left right

common matrix bones bone marrow brain spinal cord ling shu says chapter five flavours fluids amalgamate form fat irrigates cavities inside bones tonifies brain marrow flows thighs statement interesting reference form fat formed food drink goes form bone marrow spinal cord brain therefore bone marrow spinal cord brain manifestations marrow dense material type ling shu calls fat another interesting aspect statement reference marrow flowing thighs therefore ancient chinese seem grasped fact long bones contain bone marrow marrow also basis formation bone marrow nourishes bones thus kidneys also govern bone marrow bones simple questions chapter says bones fu organ marrow kidneys store jing produces marrow turn generates bone marrow contributes making blood doctor qing dynasty

latent heat autoimmune diseases chinese medicine view presence auto immune dysfunction immune system indicates aetiological factor deep energetic level different normal exterior pathogenic factors indicates insidious form pathogenic factor immune dysfunction also indicates pathology yin aspects immune system i blood bone marrow kidneys however auto immune diseases many disparate impossible prescribe blanket treatment method example pathology hashimoto thyroiditis ms different really little common thing might common aetiology many auto immune diseases aetiology latent heat case especially symptoms heat lassitude possibly fever something common pathology cases autoimmune diseases main pathology may also yin fire also know dealing auto immune disease gives important pointer point view prognosis however interesting common feature auto immune diseases pulse i noticed especially ms ra hashimoto thyroiditis crohn disease pulse leather ge quality i superficial stretched like drum empty deep level feels hard outside empty inside like drum leather pulse indicates severe deficiency blood essence yin also indicates floating upwards rooted blood would indicate root autoimmune diseases kidney deficiency approach treatment auto immune diseases chinese theory obviously diseases different must treated according specific pathology patterns ms hashimoto thyroiditis nothing common chinese perspective auto immune affects ease difficulty treatment prognosis difficult treat compare hyperthyroidism graves disease latter severe symptoms difficult treat late stages auto immune diseases seems common pulse i leather pulse superficial empty deep level surface kind broad feels kind stretched like drum indicates severe kidney deficiency must grasp aetiology pathology patterns disease ignoring auto immune nature example sjogren syndrome hashimoto thyroiditis crohn disease ms ra little nothing common terms pathology sjogren syndrome yin xu stomach liver hashimoto thyroiditis phlegm spleen xu kidney yang xu crohn disease damp heat intestines ms dampness stomach spleen xu liver kidneys xu ra damp heat joints must treat kidneys root auto immune process kidney yang kidney yin

anti inflammatory news harvard edu gazette story secrets ancient chinese remedy revealed following online article harvard university effect chinese herb chang radix dichroae febrifugae autoimmune diseases roughly years chinese herbalists treated malaria using root extract commonly known tu chang type hydrangea grows tibet nepal recent studies suggest halofuginone compound derived extract bioactive ingredient could used treat many autoimmune disorders well researchers harvard school dental medicine discovered molecular secrets behind herbal extract power turns halofuginone hf triggers stress response pathway blocks development harmful class immune cells called th cells implicated many autoimmune disorders hf prevents autoimmune response without dampening immunity altogether said malcolm whitman professor developmental biology harvard school dental medicine senior author new study compound could inspire novel therapeutic approaches variety autoimmune disorders study exciting example solving molecular mechanism traditional herbal medicine lead new insights physiological regulation novel approaches treatment disease said tracy keller instructor whitman lab first author paper study involved interdisciplinary team researchers harvard affiliated massachusetts general hospital elsewhere published online feb nature chemical biology prior research shown hf reduced scarring tissue scleroderma tightening skin multiple sclerosis scar formation even cancer progression thought hf must work signaling pathway many downstream effects said keller keller colleagues reported hf protects harmful th immune cells without affecting beneficial immune cells recognized since th cells bad actors implicated many autoimmune diseases inflammatory bowel disease rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis psoriasis researchers found minute doses hf reduced multiple sclerosis mouse model one new arsenal drugs selectively inhibits autoimmune pathology without suppressing immune system globally analysis showed hf somehow turning genes involved newly discovered pathway called amino acid response pathway aar scientists recently appreciated role nutrient sensing aar pathway immune regulation metabolic signaling also evidence extends life span delays age related inflammatory diseases animal studies caloric restriction aar lets cells know need preserve resources
