i write simply musings i wonder anything could cured steve jobs i want offer possibility i use example without fully knowing early life means explain people get seriously ill early let start hypothesis events life womb imprint trauma cells foretell serious disease later read life birth fuller explanation events smoking anxious mother drug taking depressed mother distort detour natural cellular processes baby show perhaps decades often happen carrying mother state reflected neurophysiology baby steve case auspicious beginning mother impregnated syrian heavily objected family much

mark tag changes chemical methyl process called methylation methylation changes genetic unfolding plays me constitutes primal imprint endures changes genetic legacy plays effect changes heredity known epigenetics methylation affects many biologic processes dislocating distorting function changes heredity turning genes turning development affected new research points imprint result cancer heart

mother discovered pregnant lived outcast suffered silent agony never recognized never acknowledged became overt matured mysterious disease one knew happened oncologists tried suss disease guess long

foredoomed ineluctable force eventually killed i must add i using example indicate factors play later disease aware impact early life i know genetic cancers may purely hereditary source also likely many epigenetic cancers come imprinted trauma life womb methylation refine notion bit hereditary sources later cancer may become apparent genetic tendencies compounded traumas womb know methylation effect tumor suppressing cells possible outbreak cancer increased also know therapy great enhancement natural killer cells one year treatment cells keep lookout newly forming cancer cells move destroy strong beginning therapy imprinted pain height tumor suppressor genes cause cancer cells die blocking cell growth imprinted trauma interfere functioning weak army fighting overwhelming force i seen epilepsy attacks may genetic level imprinted stress puts patient top frank disease erupts remove pain stress epileptics seizures cease normalized stress level system tolerate input without producing symptom thus symptoms often sign overload body tolerate much stimulation slops perhaps migraine high blood pressure seen patients treated untrained therapists allowed much pain erupt patient becomes overloaded leaves headache know mistakes move quickly avoid happening therapy patient turn seizure really major early trauma birth trauma find seizure primal turned inside early imprints threatening become seizure genetic tendency tendency may drive many sources genetics epigenetics crash bike serious high fever carried first months life still rarely see cancer patients may due therapy also patients suffer leaky gates repress effectively hence suffer time massive repression outlet often requisite later serious disease i believe cancer deep cellular affliction requires massive repression mature means great early imprinted pain calls massive repression deal automatic process may anguished mother father means mother alone face birth birth force leave child forever warm kind parent make alright top child perhaps totally first critical weeks life adopted let me add critical periods fulfillment need develop timetable passed nothing make lack fulfillment ameliorated keep stress level low enough avoid symptom nothing erase memory imprint basic fact pain pain remains forever leaves basic tendency toward developing symptom drug taking drinking may way deal womb life traumas patient

relived relived integration resolution means damaging womb life imprint also integrated longer creates tendency disease question whether disease tendency really gone really integrated imprinted reversed need study methylation patients see kind changes occur result therapy want know truly permanently remove aspects history early traumas critical imprints reversed remove latent tendencies generating source origin detoured cellular life removed i believe way conquer disease assuming gone far fatal otherwise cancer comes back time experts look properties cancer figure also look one early
