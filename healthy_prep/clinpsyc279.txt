familiar background please feel free skip bold heading change findings background study following phases participants responded antidepressants escitalopram celexa lexapro greater six weeks assigned open label citalopram celexa treatment weeks patients failed respond citalopram assigned open label risperidone risperdal augmentation add treatment weeks patients whose depression remitted assigned weeks either risperidone citalopram citalopram placebo differences risperidone placebo depressive relapse examined please read linked posts detail following conflicts interest nearly authors failed disclose conflicts interest one authors failed disclose relevant conflicts charles nemeroff also editor journal neuropsychopharmacology study published claim ignorance rules arise rd study nemeroff also republishing data previously published read linked post details authorship authorship switched around study went earlier abstract form final copy especially curious addition key opinion leader martin keller authorship line switch authors take big names one slap study thicker veneer academic credibility one follows trail study one would believe keller designed study already completed something fishy read linked posts background statistical legerdemain work authors earlier report declared measures would investigating assess efficacy treatment several measures reported incompletely final published version paper looks lot like burying negative data addition analyses seemed yield results could best described magical read linked post background statistical issues change findings i speculated earlier finding risperidone warded depression significantly greater extent placebo patients respond initial antidepressant treatment bogus well authors published brief corrigendum neuropsychopharmacology state following publication article authors noted abstract next last paragraph results section p value part one post hoc analyses incorrectly reported significant p value reported difference time relapse relapse rates subgroup patients fully non responsive citalopram monotherapy although p value time relapse correctly reported correct p value comparison relapse rates significant p cmh test change alter major findings study conclusions report appreciate assistance diligent reader identifying error first since i noted prior post original test looked suspiciously wrong i suppose i may diligent reader kindly welcome someone else brought attention thanks basically saying statistically uninitiated reported risperidone appeared effective group people fact analysis wrong analysis done correctly shows risperidone effective preventing return depression persons initially showed response antidepressant treatment whose depression improved taking risperidone add treatment took risperdone six months comparison people switched placebo showing improvement symptoms words risperidone prevent relapse depression abstract paper stated open label risperidone augmentation substantially enhanced response treatment resistant patients later paper stated secondary analysis revealed patients least responsive citalopram monotherapy may likely benefit continuation therapy risperidone great except result retracted words showed response initially antidepressant whether allotted receive placebo risperdal final study phase made difference equally likely experience relapse depression despite claim contrary fact change one major conclusions stork involved incorrect findings come two sources generally one honest mistake ville second corporate headquarters given large number authors paper seems pretty odd me nobody would caught error i problem honest mistakes made given large number issues surrounding authorship failure disclose conflicts interest statistical data reporting issues i suspicious take latest finding away look happens main findings abstract compare risperidone placebo quoted directly edited show recent correction median time relapse days risperidone augmentation days placebo ns relapse rates respectively post hoc analysis patients fully nonresponsive citalopram monotherapy median time relapse days risperidone augmentation placebo p relapse rates respectively p p risperidone wins one four analyses comparison placebo weakest analysis bunch one looks subgroup participants finds get little time average relapse still essentially likelihood becoming depressed taken placebo study published press releases issued attested drug efficacy helping patients treatment resistant depression second correction made paper first related disclosing relevant conflicts interest press releases correcting earlier overly optimistic press releases many physicians likely received copy study mailboxes i certain receive follow notice inform results incorrect reminds me another post described similar problems occurring throughout called scientific investigation process arise rd study officially nominated golden goblet award sure authors merit individual nomination though nemeroff keller appeared multiple times site regarding issues
