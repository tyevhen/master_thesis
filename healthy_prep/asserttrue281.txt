biology dirty little secret well known secret among deal sequenced genome data intensively i suspect many non biologists unaware problem much existing genome data sequenced genomes ranging bacteria human dna either corrupt misannotated junk dna probably exist living cells certainly exists published genomes substantial portion published genome data suspect point either contamination issues technical problems surrounding dna sequencing technology faulty gene annotation example oryza sativa indica rice genome inexplicably contains least genome bacterium acidovorax citrulli also culex mosquito genome complete copy wolbachia embedded genome rothia mucilaginosa dy contains genes incorrectly annotated antisense orientation genome burkholderia pseudomallei strain truly execrable train wreck genome another example genome gone wrong arguably bacterium ktedonobacter racemifer filled forward backward copies transposases incredibly one ktedonobacter genes transposase integrase resolvase counting many hypothetical proteins transposase like mentioned gene ontology notes disregarding organism genes marked hypothetical proteins one say ktedonobacter one four genes known function transposase integrase resolvase organism hypothetical proteins actually transposases incorrectly annotated antisense orientation common sense says something amiss misannotation problem getting worse time graph schnoes et al plos one depicts number sequences left axis bar graph found correctly annotated green sequences found misannotated shown red bars year represent sequences deposited database year fraction right axis line plot sequences deposited year genbank nr database misannotated given open nodes connected black line aid visualizing overall trend dark matter problem microbial genetics widespread openly acknowledged least according joint genome institute bacterial genes annotated hypothetical protein annotated sequence similarity match known protein many cases match many sequences wrong reading frame improperly located start codon serious issues ely scott plos one manually reannotated genome bacterium caulobacter crescentus identified new genes modified start site genes changed reading frame genes found hypothetical proteins actually non coding dna genes recent transcriptome analysis archaeon sulfolobus solfataricus resulted correction gene annotations addition new open reading frames numbers barely hint extent gene misannotation examining gene ontology database goseqlite jones et al found annotations made without use sequence similarity based methods non iss estimated error rate annotations made use sequence similarity methodology iss estimated error rate surprisingly use sequence similarity guide function identification less reliable non ss methods doubt partly reflection fact gene databases contain great deal aberrant data gene annotation programs like widely used glimmer gene locator interpolated markov modeler trained using training set training set contains faulty data classic gigo situation annotation accuracy problem getting worse year see graph devos valencia estimated misannotation levels could high recently schnoes et al concluded function prediction error i misannotation serious problem manually curated database swiss prot yet artamonova et al found five types annotation entries even vaunted uniprot swissprot database error rate even best manually curated database full errors i spent many hours examining bacterial genomes experience annotation quality uniformly poor best known genes best curated genomes best known genes i mean things like ribosomal protein genes genes well known polymerases chaperones well studied metabolic pathway genes vast majority genes encode proteins studied may never studied experimentally suspect need treated caution particularly high gc genomes programs like glimmer frequently ca distinguish sense antisense strands example pseudomonas aeruginosa mpao gene oq encoding phenol hydroxylase enzyme required catabolic breakdown phenols kind thing many pseudomonas species good run blast search gene unitprot org database find dozens good quality hits phenol hydroxylases many organisms including rhizobium sp pop natronolimnobius innermongolicus jcm rhodococcus wratislaviensis ifp quite others good quality means amino acid sequence identities values problem take dna sequence pseudomonas phenol hydroxylase reverse translate using online app web expasy org translate resulting protein sequence better match hundred pseudomonas maltose mannitol transporters match cases words called phenol hydroxylase gene phenol hydroxylase gene sugar transporter backwards trick phenol hydroxylase gordonia terrae reverse translate much better sugar permease dozens matches phenol hydroxylase view segment p aeruginosa streptomyces genomes shows region homology pink band two genomes two genes yellow gene case phenol hydroxylase program like glimmer catch things like case glimmer became confused apparent overlapping gene situation program found two open reading frames part chromosome opposite strands glimmer supposedly much better resolving overlaps glimmer used annotate around half genomes currently available public databases relied unbelievably crude heuristics resolve overlap problems case perhaps operator error things configurable degree glimmer simply designated orf legitimate gene fact blast check leaves little doubt phenol hydroxylase gene reality backwards maltose mannose transporter gene experience glimmer easily confused high gc genome data organisms like pseudomonas typically gc showing greater number reverse annotated genes blast matches hypothetical proteins low gc organisms like buchnera although noted even coli strains tend contain many suspect annotations problem partly due fact high gc content dna contains relatively stop codons six different reading frames compared low gc dna rich stop codons deciphered wrong way also problem glimmer fact high gc genomes codons tend contain purine first base position whether read forward reverse i written fact codons tend occur frequencies roughly equal reverse complement twins another confounding factor glimmer codons look whether read forward direction reverse direction although honestly i beginning wonder codon anticodon symmetries i seeing simply due widespread reverse annotation genes misannotation gene anticoding stand phenol hydroxylase one might naively suppose hard discriminate sense strand accurately given many genes begin shine dalgarno sequence ahead start codon reality turns many organisms make extensive use sd sequences short motifs like gagg occur randomly high rate mistaken shine dalgarno sequence aggravates false positive rate erroneous gene annotations rampant bacteria authors suggested problem far worse eukaryotic genomes true trouble puts bioinformatics research crisis point gene discovery algorithms good maybe bit good finding open reading frames poor identifying assigning gene functions part lack kind depth understanding protein folding required prediction dimensional structures active site conformations programmatically capability sorely needed progress gene annotation stone age living protein folding hard problem requiring supercomputers untangle maybe ten years twenty able predict protein structures computationally basis make better ab initio predictions protein function right make relatively crude markov model pattern recognition software aided human intervention come even minimally reliable genome annotation means already much better crosschecks automated need
