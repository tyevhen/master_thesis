catching old friend conference week i struck different ways disposed understand dreams phenomena i naturally take manifest dynamic unconscious i saw domain personal meaning saw largely epiphenomenon i saw self evident truth saw interesting generally unlikely hypothesis i entering pearly gates hear truth matter almighty i lay fifty quid said psychoanalytic theory dream symbolism nothing i found myself trying argue case quickly got trapped two unappealing alternatives one hand i wanted offer evidence theory became clear really going help relation theory would always natural within epistemological framework take psychoanalytic explanation something reaching beyond facts hypothetical way positing hidden mechanism behind thus i started talking primary processes i see underlie formation i see dream symbols question quickly became evidence true evidence mechanism actually instantiated hand i honestly tempted pull freudian fast one saying friend unwilling grasp theory defended acknowledgement dynamic unconscious i somewhat embarrassedly admit i actually think often something right latter option appalling dialectical move strikes me i normally think dream symbolism operation defence mechanisms transference i one moment think consisting posits scientific claims sure individual cases may hypotheses guesses example i may know well enough know tense relationship boss function expectation erratically capriciously tend discern relationships generally men life father onwards i get kind feel observation required general i would tend view thinking terms dynamic unconscious pretty much footing like kind thing requires footing thinking conscious lives i take general thinking dynamic unconscious involves hypothesis i conscious life i take entering pearly gates would seem natural me ask dreams really manifest range defence mechanisms psychoanalytic symbolisms repressed emotions etc would enter pearly gates ask god whether beliefs thoughts really exist latter question i take simply bad question subscribe kind metaphysical realism get ground say sublime logic 'real generate illusion inquiry makes sense bad question know ascribe beliefs know reality believing amounts question whether believing real point i appreciate time friend saying little celestial gambling parable clearly designed indicate dynamic unconscious taken posit effect amounts kind cognitive reach positing something seems beyond ken something god know i demurred seems me less ascription conditions unconscious beliefs condensation displacement phantasy psychoanalytic symbolism conscious beliefs look i said called displacement one thing 'symbolise another mind etc psychoanalysis phenomenology speculative psycho mechanics rub ca phenomenological inspection way simple examples talked dinner certainly ca dispose definition either unconscious desire disposition features xyz etc grasping ascription conditions unconscious mentality involves deepening immersion set phenomena deepening development sensibility affective undertow lives i think freud defended theory canard kinda right except freud theory sceptic defended unconscious well course enhanced memory one evasions moments humbling acknowledgement collapses defences honesty social anxieties hardly show face one accomplished pseudo maturity yet still show something coat tails live experience transference countertransference i hasten add kind familiarity psychological explanatory system familiarity churns sentences concerning putative background mechanism underlying straightforwardly observable phenomena lives kind positing religious cultishness another reason i suspect friend paltry celestial wager instead noticing one pulled believe feel things oneself emotionally intense relationships therapeutic relationships fact ascription conditions available hardly available god either would instead genuine discourse regarding dynamic unconscious would simply illusion discourse god could say circumstance whether really dynamic unconscious symbolic content dreams rather i sorry chum let really got ta acknowledge even know asking put wager idea dreaming epiphenomenon surely i want say know largely correct gives sense something evident waking reflection dreaming alone dreams arrive various predicaments ca think properly asleep yet degree anxious anxiously try various options seem present dream unfolds thereby ongoing anxiously clumsy attempts manage dream predicament narrator function visual sometimes auditory imagination function anxiety response somewhat switched dreams despite shutdown many parts brain function fact unconstrained reality contact utterly lost within first person narrator perspective visual imagination function dreaming quite outstrip achieve day surely one reasons dreams seem wonderful numinous yet far i tell none detracts psychoanalytic theory personal anxieties wishes particular shapes ongoing reactive dream landscape perfect one automatically show anxieties wishes unconscious yet dreaming state absence imagination constraining reality contact still find kind expression dream dream royal road unconscious wishes counter wishes longer simply blocked tend play playing may even contribute creative energy dream i believe place epiphenomenal dynamic understandings clash idea dream genesis imagine someone trying stage clash using word 'just 'but supplies dream content day residue plus longer term unresolved issues matter random neurons firing head might look like competing hypotheses nobody wants subscribe dualism psychoanalysis name give one forms rejection dualism takes 'look says 'you really 'you id ego 'you dreamer dream mental life images feelings preoccupations moments biography
