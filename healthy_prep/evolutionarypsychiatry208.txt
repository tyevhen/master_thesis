last post endocannabinoids i trying little much little time i think science came clearly today i thought i would use excellent kim et al paper quick summary known effects endocannabinoids obesity central nervous system usual bailiwick peripherally also please check beth post weight maven diagrams endocannabinoid aea activate cannabis receptors brain fat tissue skeletal muscle response increase food intake possibly increasing appetite hormone ghrelin aea found higher levels obese individuals lean individuals seems promote fat storage muscle decreases glucose uptake one way increase insulin resistance major human endocannabinoid ag also increases food intake also found higher levels obese individuals amount ag circulating body positively correlated much body fat inversely related insulin sensitivity also decreases glucose uptake muscle cck hormone secreted intestines eat normally sends signal brain telling yes indeed eaten back hunger signals already aea ag higher levels seem interfere whole signaling process higher levels aea ag found obese individuals leptin hormone acts hypothalamus brain working normally leptin sends signal fed need hungry anymore however obese individuals often high leptin levels suggesting brains obese individuals become resistant leptin effects leptin resistant mice increased levels endocannabinoids swimming around plump mouse bodies mice born without ability make leptin treatment leptin quickly lower endocannabinoid levels obviously cross talk regulation somehow becomes broken case obesity omega fatty acids become endocannabinoids associated increase fat tissue decreased insulin sensitivity leptin resistance oops keep mind associated smoking gun pretty theory i ca help squee little kim et al pro omega fatty acid suggesting help reduce obesity reduce endocannabinoid signaling increase insulin sensitivity use work william lands suggest increase dietary omega pufa efficient decreasing eicosanoid formation omega derivatives decreasing omega pufa diet eicosanoids bioactive molecules prostaglandins endocannabinoids thromboxane made omega omega fatty acids i downloaded took gander lands paper referenced whole time good dr lands talks current denmark diets omega pufa high increasing total ratio omega omega pufa reasonable way go seems systems deficient omega hungrily gobble omega perhaps kim et al means increase omega efficient decreasing omega pufas diet knows thinking interesting quote lands article fish however fatal hypersensitivity environmental stimuli fainting shock syndrome exhibited rainbow trout fed diets containing fatty acids without sufficient counterbalancing amounts fatty acids fainting shock syndrome wow rainbow trout eat corn oil enough said
