mechanism plays important role human social commerce first step toward survival species male rats treated vasopressin first week life aggressive later strangers vasopressin released stress system combated oxytocin may seem strange molecularly similar use receptors vasopressin plays role determining partner preference male animals encourages selection specific female partners one essential
