introduction psychologists uta frith john morton recently attempted clarify least framework constraining reasoning deployed certain models theories found psychological end today cognitive neurosciences interested particular cognitive development developmental disorders interest however epistemological developmental psychological i want start elucidate distinction two types explanation psychology suggest goes name 'causal modelling typically conflates two types explanation personal background irritation way psychologists mistake ability conceptually distinguish cause correlation resting point requisite reflective understanding causation two types explanation type looking small window see branch break tree front see caused happen perhaps wind perhaps someone sawing sight near trunk perhaps woodpecker perhaps big fat squirrel sitting sight end away trunk perhaps let call search reason branch breaking looking efficient cause happening type looking another small window see letters end banner moving past ca see whole banner end letters ng al rs wonder banner saying pattern completes see go outside robert graves moment stuck room two hypnagogic hallucinations first reads campaigning animal protesters second reads understanding developmental disorders unlike graves base hypothesis strength imagery go outside discover large processional advert morton book let call search particular type explanation required search pattern completes differences differences two types explanation things i find myself wanting say first sort explanation provides cause happens say branch snapped weight squirrel see came originated explain one thing branch breaking terms thing jumping squirrel i want say second tells seeing come understanding understanding makes sense something terms something already makes sense might know someone carrying banner happened banner went past window letters got printed least one sense coming see else banner explain letters went past window told phenomenon origination phenomenon one find intelligible find particular letters intelligible terms kinds things already experience turned nonsense written banner letters end nonsense words finding extra information would made saw intelligible way finding part advert morton book made intelligible i hope enough getting one makes event intelligible informing precipitants 'efficient causes call clearly 'causal makes intelligibility situating particular within intelligible context 'see first know something happened latter understand better happened course events may redescribed terms causes i relying finding obvious intelligibility conferring pattern completing type two explanation amounts i hope others find acceptable enough i claim told 'explaining developmental disorders rather 'campaigning animal protesters went past window given causal explanation occurrence letters i saw latter case puzzlement inquiry inspire provision cause way answer i needed phenomenology aetiology causal modelling psychology i shall claiming 'causal models psychology sometimes run two senses together portray different sorts explanation causal lead epistemological confusion morton tells strategy 'causal modelling approach interested way developmental disorders develop general strategy posit cognitive processes causal intermediaries biological abnormalities phenotypic behavioural expressions let look example book well worth read way many ways model clarity objections first model presented relation 'biological 'cognitive kind relation 'cognitive 'behavioural second relatedly suggestion made cognitive factors 'inferred entities form understanding accordingly inference best causal explanation morton says regarding three levels description p one substantive assumption framework i present i call cognitive level major role play causal chains interest implicit many diagnostic descriptions see framework cognitive made explicit reality cognition makes clear people get confused try map biology straight behaviour i objecting significance cognitive level confusions result try map biology straight onto behaviour function cognitive factors occupying 'causal intermediary function case brain behaviour things seem me i want understand relations cognitive factors i want understand 'the reason bit behaviour i searching far akin type explanation type morton tells cognitive factor p 'far redescription behaviour idea cognitive factor question sprang seems doubtful me although much turn mean 'redescription consider genetics brain relations figure surely causal type relations i would say effects brain differences resulting cognitive structures inner intelligibility cognitive factors elucidated brain dysfunctions rather see originated efficient causes cognitive factors appreciate putative biological origins relations theory mind unlearned social conventions theory mind deficits imaginative deficits mind quite different relations say lack imagination pretend play consider latter example see child pretend playing situation might otherwise expect child pretend playing wonder perhaps anxious perhaps imagination perhaps glued seat lazy according morton considered 'causal explanations lack pretend play mind far analogous type explanations discover going someone example independently identify lack imagination quite independently alleged manifestations rather discover come see pattern obtains life see whole host behaviours aspect 'imaginal impoverishment see otherwise acting without anxiety boredom glue straightforward redescription one particular behaviour sure tells lot provides pattern explains particular kind intelligibility efficient causality pertains cognitive see similarities aspects instantiations immanence see relations isolable causes isolable effects 'inference lack imagination inference something completely transcends behavioural data lack pretend play confronting course simply reducible see rather meaningful pattern connects case surely even obvious consider relation 'low general ability 'low iq way could low iq said 'caused 'low general ability concept 'ability obviously dispositional obviously logically merely empirically related behavioural someone low general ability follows deductively low iq i missing something deductive character said obtain psychological phenomena behaviourist dismay doubt case would really obvious would even psychological vocabulary first place appendix pecularity morton book pretty much entire approach seems me purely 'downward arrow trajectory biology cognition behaviour leaving aside epistemological qualms i surprised lack dynamic systems perspective given way theories typically displaced linear approach last years cf ch furthermore development normally occur social isolation others simply maturation building two factors lead models dynamic i feedback loops within within levels systemic involving interaction back forth environment rather static linear morton approach would seem work disorders stem isolable way biologically generated disturbances cognitive function cf stuart shanker autism dynamic developmental model emotions philosophy psychiatry psychology example different approach
