today i reading failure trends large disk drive population pdf february paper eduardo pinheiro wolf dietrich weber luiz andr barroso google containing lots great data hard drive failures difficulty predicting graph depicts one interesting findings effect operating temperature disk reliability appears vary disk age younger drives tend susceptible low temperature failures whereas older drives tend susceptible failure elevated temperatures results grouped age disk failure broken subgroups histogram bars based operating temperature example among disks failed years age annualized failure rate afr disks operating temps deg versus fail rate seen temps less deg many people assumed high temps bad disks indeed maybe bad year old disks disks fail younger ages tend much traumatized cold heat pinheiro et al give additional data pretty convincing example look fig paper see bathtub curve showing extremes temperature deleterious disk life expectancy ironically bathtub curve reaches lowest point around deg close human body temperature
