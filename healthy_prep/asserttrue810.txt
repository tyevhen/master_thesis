day communique performance optimization methodology view presentations david nuescheler tags optimization cq folks day software put together common sense pointers attacking performance optimization problems involving content management systems advice applies pretty generally manner enterprise software i thought i post david brief slideshow subject elaborates ideas blog entry i would add side comments main comment performance optimization view approached kind debugging exercise want narrow source main bottleneck fact one main bottleneck find fix bottleneck proceed find new main bottleneck fix lather rinse repeat easy get side tracked waste time optimizing something completely unimportant careful testing tell important think important may debugging exercise never start fiddling million variables looking find million sources trouble looking find main source trouble rare experience performance ever gated several factors less equal magnitude every time i gone search performance i found always one bottleneck greatly surpassed others importance i finally found eliminated main bottleneck new one outstripped others eliminating first choke point might give say three fold speedup eliminating second one might give another two fold increase performance subsequent bottleneck removal adds multiplier effect unusual removing three bottlenecks row gives overall ten fold increase performance anyone ported code assembly language knows i talking something else i add best practices always beat better hardware using clever algorithm place stupid one constitutes best practice purposes discussion throwing hardware problem seldom worthwhile sometimes leads performance problems actually go looking performance problems million places generally answer one place
