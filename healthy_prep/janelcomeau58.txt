i love dystopian teen novels yes oh yes rest world getting sick dystopian fantasy genre i still wake every morning eager read teen angst forced caste systems cartoonishly sinister governments mostly i live mayonnaise white suburb post apocalyptic biker gangs speak corrupt authority figures officials city hall make pay bag garbage pickup crumbling ruins great city welcome escape i heard divergent trilogy i disregarded mixed reviews i heard went get hands copy books specifically one read book want know ends turn back yes spoilers ahead without going much detail first two books pretty good timeless literary masterpieces nope i expect course divergent insurgent exactly i wanted easy read entertainment cool world structure neat characters good old fashioned teen angst also noteworthy fact author veronica roth wrote first book school break university picked movie deal time degree twenty five years old got bestselling trilogy millions fans movie series bright future writer admirable allegiant let back bit first divergent trilogy takes place future post apocalyptic chicago characters descendants survivors enormous war war society divided five 'factions based human trait group thought necessary preventing another war dividing groups based ideology always humanity effective strategy preventing war five factions abnegation amity candor dauntless erudite figure trait faction prizes looking words dictionary protagonist beatrice prior lives faction system abnegation child children live parents faction sixteen take hallucination based aptitude test shows faction 'truly belong go show 'choosing faction live rest lives obligated pick aptitude test result essentially doomed life misery surrounded people feel connection yay essence entire world divergent takes place giant post apocalyptic high school course divergent ca placed one category aptitude test among vague nebulous powers tris divergent spends series hiding fact world divergent hunted murdered existing nazi high school alligiant tris shocked wander outside chicago discover entire world less science experiment life known huge lie perfectly fine way end story pull right allegiant fell short me couple big reasons quite genes work genetics come lot science fiction dystopia sorts interesting moral dilemmas explored use dna technology novels aldous huxley brave new world explored evils genetic experimentation years sequenced human genome genetics based stories picking steam ever since great science comes great responsibility explain correctly fantastic rule thumb using genetics science fiction word 'genetics story replaced word 'magic 'voodoo without changing anything using wrong scientist optimizes buffer solution polymerase chain reaction allegiant word 'genetics could replaced word 'pepperoni story still would change see third book tris finally given gene based explanation factions divergent structure world ever known hundreds years ago scientists took human genome joy ride attempt create superhumans perfect personalities accidentally created flawed race violent people strange reason like treated damaged second class subhumans went war 'unmodified humans tris world chicago set war gigantic 'gene therapy experiment rounded thousands defeated 'damaged humans attempted fix genes generations interbreeding scientists figured genetic damage would heal healthy 'divergent people would created gene splicing works gone far science let start biggest obvious problem ca create healthy genes interbreeding damaged ones never work i highlight real world example hemophilia hereditary blood disease prevents blood clotting people disease bleed death something simple scraped knee scab disorder caused mutation damage chromosome rarely see females since females two copies chromosome healthy copy takes live normal lives unaware carry deadly disease genes male mutation however backup chromosome experiences full effects disorder chances people reading never met person hemophilia never rare point almost unheard happens take population people hemophilia gene interbreed generations think damaged genes heal according royal families almost every european nation whose inbreeding turned rare disease uncontrollable epidemic put end bloodlines ask alexei romanov worked another huge problem faction system set actually brilliantly designed create extreme behavioral problems balanced individuals people bureau allege trying breed divergent people people fit polarized faction system instead display range different strengths character actions say trying opposite think faction prizes characteristic trait else point individuals extreme traits held leaders role models series acknowledges genetic basis traits also shows zero interbreeding members different factions figuring biology plays exactly brain surgery basic sexual selection people dauntless show courage going successful best chances finding similarly courageous mate people least courageous die least die alone passing generation going get extreme personalities extreme genetic damage entire faction bred flagrant disregard personal safety lemming hancock building goes factions compounding fact 'healthy divergents end killed homeless removed simulation breeding extreme traits population bureau goal literally could found worse way go people city still die resets bureau reading retention read book give one bedazzled fuck spoilers tris tobias face huge dilemma third book point story three groups competing interests starting clash factionless want see faction system disbanded allegiant want see faction system preserved bureau want city chicago razed ground inhabitants murder evelyn leader factionless decides halfway book way highway resolves murder shit anyone gets way effective problem solving bureau ca allow half population chicago die senseless war faced choice either shut experiment completely debrief everyone involved set 'normal lives outside city crop dust inhabitants memory serum make forget war quietly return faction lives choose latter tris friends enough time connections get city inoculate loved ones serum wo forget hits enough tris oh decides making entire population forget lives egregious amoral immediately turns around tries exact thing bureau employees apparently stealing someone memories identities wrong unless personally approve jaden smith level philosophy right tris tobias plan elaborate dangerous heist prevent gassing chicago stealing serum gassing bureau instead i think forgetting something chicago get memory reset people love going die war reset meant prevent seriously everyone bureau wandering around post amnesia daze way prevent evelyn army swooping murdering joanne cara susan people fighting factionless tyranny chicago plan stop put 'everyone getting murdered eggs basket hope tobias mother feels strongly cause literally faked death left son hands abusive monster suddenly overcome fit maternal instict memory serum remember destroying people memories wrong tris decides desperate plan fails tris tobias forced stand watch security monitors powerless stop whoops essence tris forced make choice two evils one hand yes people forget lives go back living orderly misguided society new identities heads full false memories loved ones outside city spared still remember everything reset everyone else forget everything including pain experienced horrors families lost murders forced commit get chance start forget traumas tris choice half get gunned crazy lady army homeless people yeah i say tris chose wrong everyone needs die two reasons author kill character plot shock cast sean bean play works killing character plot usually manifests one two ways might need character around future events might need instill personality change main character first case goes something like counting timmy thing dead still need thing done conflict ned stark great example vital information joffrey parentage going spread around information would really useful lot people later books unfortunately since ned dead gossip plot gone different direction second case get something like jim bob always passive person since timmy died grain thresher become angry gluten free words tangible change important character death think sirius black harry potter death may affected later events series main reason killing give harry determination succeed cases character death matters works advance story somehow sirius death also inspired worst tribute haircut time author ca find way kill character plot purposes something fall back shock essence murder character make audience gasp marvel heartless world created bonus points funny beloved gentle otherwise likable character story really better character dead whole point get knee jerk emotional reaction reader arguably deaths end harry potter series served shock reader story almost end rowling wanted make sure given swift kick heart really necessary k rowling thing shock deaths work really well twice maybe three times skilled readers hearts break grieve grip pages little tighter read hoping remaining favourite characters wo meet fate need way make sure readers good attached characters killing one tells audience 'hey kind story people die one safe better enjoy beloved jim bob another grain thresher coming chapter might next like novelty frozen yogurt shops threesomes former spice girls much 'good thing write story virtually every character guaranteed horrible death point readers check basic survival instinct would anyone let get attached someone doomed shredded piece farm equipment point another people care first death story unless crafted generation story like harry potter one cares death incidentally death harry potter series mrs abbott hannah abbott mother probably care one biggest problems divergent series allegiant particular everyone dies seriously take look list main characters books tris prior tobias eaton christina al peter edward molly eric jeanine tori uriah lynn marlene shauna caleb andrew prior natlie prior marcus eaton evelyn johnson cara johanna david nita matthew look list notice anything characters dead series ends dead main characters living ones main cast deceased characters live one crippled life one wandering around haze self induced amnesia rest best ward suicidal thoughts long enough eke empty lives shadows people lost problem i care al throws chasm book one tragic scared lost kid uncertain future made big mistake could fix succumbed despair sad death also heartbreaking attacks tris mind control forced fatally shoot self defense action haunts rest life sad time hit allegiant things start getting ridiculous short people die sole purpose making book dark tori murdered ambush never really explained prevent happy reunion long lost brother george uriah killed crime standing near wall make sure tobias breaks promise zeke fact uriah best friends lynn marlene killed equally dubious reasons making first book i ever seen resolves love triangle murdering everyone involved unrelated incidents first person series switched new narrator allegiant i immediately figured something terrible looming protagonist yeah look worried even main character death senseless makes noble sacrifice survives impossible odds shot dead last second plot twist prove abstract point love selflessness last character die books exception david died offscreen veronica roth confirmed death injuries time hits ground friends already dead shocking surprising even sad i given attachment i characters long ago started flipping pages waiting see next one would bite dust deaths went tragic ordinary one thing dystopia ordinary
