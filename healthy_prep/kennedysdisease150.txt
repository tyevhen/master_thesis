part i discussed general subject gene therapy including pros cons today article i focus possible application gene therapy treatment kennedy disease gene therapy kennedy disease recently i received following inquiry please review article quest magazine gene therapy success husband i wondering gene therapy healthy relative could cure sbma i thought would opportunity learn differences using gene therapy treat inclusion body myositis ibm computer company kennedy disease asked mr science biology professor kda board member usual came me i professors like i school interesting study true demonstrates new least me method gene therapy i hope full copy paper soon i abstract found bit info disease referenced study namely ibm i could gather inherited form ibm recessive mutation gne gene suggests disease due lack normal gne protein researchers injected good copy gene technique allowed cells take good copy gene cells apparently rescued however note report quest indicates muscles rescued regard kennedy disease simple answer problem kennedy disease function particular protein case androgen receptor i form still works additional property kills nerve cells scientists mean 'gain function mutation thus simply giving patients good copy help one works fine since remove therapy cells two copies one good one added original kennedy disease one cells still make kennedy disease version cells still die even though also good copy order sure technique would work would therapy add 'good version gene one also remove kennedy disease version one knows possible however progression kennedy disease could slowed gene therapy i think known would occur i sure i explained well let me use bad analogy imagine protein made kennedy disease gene watchdog normal watchdog attacks strangers function genetic diseases due lack protein analogy would lacked watchdog like ibm due lack protein cure would replace new dog gene article problem watchdog attacked strangers also attacked family getting new dog helpful still super aggressive one necessary add new dog also remove old one kennedy disease like second scenario need remove old form gene well add good one i hope makes bit sense bottom line simply adding 'normal copy gene probably helpful unlikely would come relative anyone copy would i also asked neurologist researcher dr paul taylor thoughts subject obstacles approach kennedy disease first therapy described gene replacement therapy words type muscle disease caused deficiency gene question therapeutic strategy replace missing gene kennedy disease caused deficiency single gene rather caused toxicity mutated gene second disease described primarily problem muscle cells easier target motor neurons believed primary cell type affected kennedy disease said possible treating muscle may turn beneficial kennedy disease even muscle primary tissue affected disease maria pennuto data published last year suggests possibility case rather replacement deficient gene kennedy disease mice benefit muscle boosting gene called igf furthermore may turn primary muscle involvement important previously thought working presently would make muscle even important target like anything else kennedy disease computer acts simple fix solve problem perhaps unique i say positive way i find interesting subject gene therapy causes dichotomy opinion feel gene therapy especially became treatment kennedy disease
