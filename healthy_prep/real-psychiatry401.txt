like fda critical agency terms pharmaceutical regulation politics pharmaceuticals easy confuse politics drugs pharmaceutical science clear examples include special interest groups lobbying fda members congress rapid access medications approved specific indications medications significant side effects low therapeutic efficacy time fda criticized approving medications add nothing existing pharmacopeia marginal evidence efficacy view medications tools need applied various label ways practicing physicians definition lower threshold regulatory approval standard medication must effective safe turns medications profile problems inconsistencies glaring others i surprised get recent warning letter fda inhaled preparation loxapine called adasuve loxapine antipsychotic drug medium potency back late drug trial loxapine versus haloperidol one inpatient units i running time fairly effective drug acute symptoms psychosis less potent haloperidol fewer neurological side effects never seemed like popular medication psychiatrists recurrent interest around issue first second generation antipsychotics authors suggesting receptor profile similar second generation atypical antipsychotics initial period approved marketed brand name loxitane available oral injectable forms i could locate one study pubmed adasuve current medical literature searching brand name studies clinicaltrials gov web site unfortunately results posted appear interesting including one looks qtc interval effects inhaled loxapine review adasuve web site shows bronchospasm black box warning risk evaluation mitigation strategy rems assess prior prescribing monitoring patient administered dose looks like given registered health care facility personnel assess manage pulmonary complications although pulmonary conditions contraindicate use seem fairly straightforward asthma copd pulmonary diagnosis associated bronchospasm actual diagnoses probably complex due number factors including smoking status body weight complexity underlying pulmonary syndromes staff administering medication assess patient pulmonary problems every episode depend historical diagnoses philosophical standpoint needs active debate new patents patent extensions medications currently generic drugs like loxapine time primarily used certainly demonstrate superior efficacy side effect profile relative typical atypical antipsychotics loxapine metabolized amoxapine fda approved antidepressant used limited basis psychiatric practice generally considered first second line antidepressant metabolic relationship led authors speculate combination may effective psychotic depression application never realized case drug limited applications repackaged riskier dosage form seems like several steps wrong direction details pharmacokinetics available package insert looking data main advantage appears short time takes reach maximum plasma concentration minutes useful study would looked subgroup patients taking parenteral loxapine similar pharmacokinetic measures study i alluded loxapine compared directly haloperidol acute agitation schizophrenia bipolar disorder medication released practice i still working acute inpatient unit i would skeptical using medication acute agitation use limited single dose hour period people need medication generally medically complex may still street drugs system generally cigarette smokers pulmonary many cases cardiac status may unknown initial dose effective question becomes patient preference may issue since patients request fast acting medication want parenteral injections patients addiction history may used drugs insufflation inhalation intravenous injection may factor decision making factors considered studies patient preference specific medications treat acute agitation antipsychotic class medications olanzapine highly rated besides degree acceptance post marketing surveillance important terms medication side effects current approval based pooled data three studies looking total patients getting active medication patient receiving placebo many doses medication zohydro probably requires less discussion zohydro advertised acetaminophen free extended release form hydrocodone available united states available dosage forms ranging mg mg intended twice day dose schedule zohydro comes following black box warning interesting part approval process scientific advisory panel fda voted overwhelmingly approving medication approved anyway currently midst opioid epidemic based number metrics including emergency department visits complications deaths accidental overdose per capita consumption opioids relative rest world increasing number people addicted opioids also entering period increased policing physicians numerous agencies opioid prescribing practices fairly good evidence opioid epidemic started pain treatment initiative suggesting physicians treating pain aggressively enough pendulum swung point clear blame least physicians using opioids treat chronic pain couple additional problems fda approved package insert zohydro first indication reason fda approved drug first place indication zohydro management pain severe enough require daily around clock long term opioid treatment alternative treatment options inadequate shockingly inadequate description pain syndrome keeping medication tool model regulatory approval acceptable physician prescribing medication specific pain diagnosis specifically addresses chronicity pain might acceptable approach second problem first read package insert following graphic efficacy medication plots results study zohydro versus placebo subjects already chronic opioid therapy chronic back pain i think examples highlight fact fda seem guiding philosophy comes new drug approvals repackaged generics darwinian free market approach since original drug passed safety efficacy standards would repackaged generic physicians demand specific regulatory approach minimum needs clearer evidence advance pharmacotherapy terms increased efficacy better side effect profile repackaging generic drugs without kind guidance obvious risks seems like mistake me also needs better approach chronic pain drugs clearly addictive uniform methodology measuring efficacy studies looking opioid use chronic pain show modest pain relief best clinical practice relief generally order expected non opioids population wide comparisons easy way operationalize knowledge instruct pharmaceutical manufacturers appropriate design clinical trials answer questions also issue conflict interest need complete disclosure advocating use medications question addiction standpoint hydrocodone acetaminophen compounds frequently diverted abused compounds uncommon get history people taking amounts equivalent chronic overdoses acetaminophen component many people addiction aware risks acetaminophen component chronic phase addiction develops continue use ignore danger patient preferences factor decision prescribe opioid hydrocodone combination medications high demand street indicating me preferred product many addicts package insert contains remarkably little useful practical information abuse dependence addiction told rems strategy fda requiring manufacturers newly approved long acting opioids conduct long term follow studies look serious risks long term use i think would lot easier fda regulators looked current data cdc web site addiction risk opioids answer question would zohydro different george dawson md dfapa fda adasuve full prescribing information click appropriate link european medicines agency adasuve epar european public assessment report additional clinical note fda issued recommendation health professionals stop using combination products contain mg acetaminophen page link letter sent manufacturers dose strengths withdrawn next three years based rationale increased efficacy acetaminophen risk hepatotoxicity i know mg acetaminophen magic number addiction experience combination products suggest people routinely use potentially toxic doses part addiction even know potential problem amount acetaminophen new rule may increase increase amount opioids prescribed
