erwin chargaff working sea urchin sperm observed within double stranded dna amount adenine equals amount thymine guanine equals cytosine know basis complementarity dna chargaff later went observe thing studies single stranded dna causing postulate generally within well across strands dna general postulation known chargaff second parity rule says within single strand dna second parity rule seemed make sense priori reason think dna rna whether single stranded double stranded contain purines pyrimidines vice versa factors equal nature favor one class nucleotide another therefore across evolutionary times frames one would expect purine pyrimidine prevalences nucleic acids equalize instead find look real world dna rna individual strands seldom contain equal amounts purines pyrimidines szybalski first note viruses usually contain single stranded nucleic acids often contain purines pyrimidines others since verified szybalski found namely many organisms dna purine heavy sense strand coding regions messenger rna ends richer purines pyrimidines called szybalski rule previous post i presented evidence analysis sequenced genomes bacterial genera szybalski rule often true chargaff second parity rule fact purine loading coding region message strands occurs direct proportion amount inverse propoertion amount genome contents dna becomes heavier heavier purines message strand contents find organisms message strand actually pyrimidine heavy instead purine heavy i present evidence purine loading message strands proportion content universal phenomenon applying wide variety
