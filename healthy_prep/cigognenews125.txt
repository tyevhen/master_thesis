said great many booga booga aficionados plus someone else former head national institute mental health could let me explain try interrupt first mean brain disease mean brain really diseased i mean real affliction hit head slow moving virus proof i seen maybe looking wrong lens looking outside guessing may lie inside sure give name brain disease really mean disease lie i idea let look inside without serious surgery look humans lives brains seems me missing human history i mean brain live vacuum lives environment maybe world lies answers looking would ever search answers liver disease without seeing environment constantly bathed alcohol would help find answer find brain constantly bathed pain concomitant nefarious effects chronically high cortisol level indicating enduring stress maybe disease imprinted pain never leaves largely pain begins say i pain wonder one knows well come i smug think i answers well one thing i think i answers important ones i lived pain something freezes mouth closed ordinary force open i several thousand patients almost fifty years gone similar experiences done double blind studies england france measure observations results perform double blind research find major changes many biologic parameters discussed scientific journals patients report significant improvement many former diseases recently someone grand mal seizures years longer whole life turned around shall filming see happened see actual disease longer concoct brain disease explain psychological mysteries mysteries simply unobserved realities therefore found found way wind back evolutionary clock take close look personal histories meanwhile history species seems old truths never go backwards life another myth travel backwards time reverse happened past times essence work called de methylation many research results confirm hypotheses maybe need look effects imprinted primal pain see lies behind many serious afflictions maybe others pick therapeutic cudgels look found way go deep brain natural way evolution reverse see truth need find ways look deep neuroscience i never started priori id fixe idea i wanted find research i started knowing i want wanting know therefore stake results often surprise current research helps confirm much work theories i confidence right track maybe others field look spent nearly profits wanting know good patients health also good profession particularly science use vague terms brain science leads nowhere helps one unless course really know disease brain talking disease turns deep brain brainstem unbelievable therefore ignored one disease monumental far reaching consequences exactly neglected apotheosized neo cortex thereby gone terribly wrong i want shout brainstem also limbic system need look warped thinking make world go wrong devastating early life became imprinted steered cortex askew salvation lies reorienting cortex toward normal functions may hope think way give medicine disease holding back symptom treating wrong disease course never cure start cure right disease longer need medication ad nauseam brain disease specific primal imprint gestation birth know imprint leaves trace example mother overdoses anesthetics birth producing baby breathe easily reliving trauma therapy seems suffocating mean suffocating yes trauma imprint dogs throughout life let go addressed relived many cases relived damaging results imprint leaves trace gene measureable hope see reversible forthcoming research trauma experience must lived finally must come life experienced resolved longer extraneous force becomes organic part reason say brain disease idea lies antipodes brain forced guess make vague statement might inside real disease many ramifications seems like many diseases affects brain function hence brain disease also immune system done research well circulatory blood systems everywhere else former chief mental health officer dr insel someone i respect loss reason many professionals know lies hidden inside without primal techniques i fail see anyone really know requires descent cerebral underground something took decades figure secret open indeed primal legacy videos dr france janov coming within weeks shows process primal therapy shows professionals must done help others five years making want monopoly know dangerous explore deep brain without knowing exactly seen harm patients done rebirthing therapy skipping evolutionary steps abutting early forceful imprints patient ready result confused jumbled mind dr insel say august new scientist believes schizophrenia depression brain diseases outgrowth physiologic changes see https newscientist article mg psychiatry reinventing thanks advances biology yes ok makes changes imprints lying low alter biochemistry relive symptoms diminish cart pulling horse get anywhere way insel believes need fold psychotherapy neurology make things precise sort denigrates psychology neurology done much better field emotions assumes thought disorders brain circuitry human anywhere inside looks markers brain consider markers environment start life starting parents birth doctors believes nearly always underlying disorder brain circuits i guess emotions vague aleatory pinned scientifically result psychiatrists using neurology merge freudian analysis help make science let see want take year old therapy missing validity construct neurology around make freudian theory scientific putting dress dung make pretty acceptable renewing theories aligning neurology neurology last word human experience neurology must try align human experience maintain exalted position dr insel says found depression one several diseases i doubt one disease many manifestations make seem like many diseases deal deep pain therapy goes see spreads system affect breathing heart rate yet still one disease levels diminish ensemble reliving finally making pain organic said neuroscience great help must included scientific armamentarium use time confirm findings meant englobe take place key functions emotions feelings suss cause neurosis profound observation neurons dr insel wants build neuroscience help find answers early lives brain nervous system imprinted experiences imprints radically change trajectory lives first need know look patient look mri need know seeing finally need know means low body temp depressive good bad sign without proper theory never know body temperature rises normal levels good sign need fully armed theory experience behind need stop guessing
