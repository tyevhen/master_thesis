catalase test simple add drop hydrogen peroxide sample bacteria microscope slide see fizzes anaerobes even aerotolerant ones streptococcus pyogenes wo fizz lack catalase aerobic bacteria produce oxygen bubbles right i remember first time i introduced young bacteriology student catalase test scrape colony bacteria surface agar dish rub onto microscope slide take ordinary eyedropper filled hydrogen peroxide drop big fat drop liquid onto little slimy smudge bacteria smudge begins fizz vigorously like alka seltzer bacteria catalase positive fizzing happens catalase negative fizzing happens enzyme called catalase promotes conversion hydrogen peroxide water molecular oxygen ho ho last hundred years every student bacteriology taught reason aerobic bacteria indeed aerobic life forms including humans catalase hydrogen peroxide severely toxic must gotten rid lest form highly reactive hydroxyl radicals ho oh oh oh radicals extremely reactive chemically attack anything dna rna proteins lipids mucopolysaccharides hydroxyl radicals toxic catalase provides way neutralizing peroxides radicals form anaerobic organisms story goes lack catalase live oxygen poor environments things like peroxides form called strict anaerobes actually killed exposure air reason die come contact air supposedly presence oxygen experience endogenous buildup peroxides absence catalase go form toxic free radicals turn eventually cause damage dna proteins lipids macromolecules official dogma peroxides free radicals catalase trouble much dogma world completely wrong would harmless prattle applied bacteria unfortunately bit assumption laden dogma peroxides free radicals leads rather fanciful notions role oxidative stress ordinary metabolism notion peroxides free radicals called reactive oxygen species harmful led spending billions research dollars oxidative stress ways stave oxidative damage dna proteins etc led billions dollars misleading advertising around foods rich antioxidants actually led clinical trials antioxidants like beta carotene vitamin people died needlessly something i discuss detail future post might want refer paper suppose rather accepting catalase detoxifier peroxides evil theory face value ask fundamental questions evidence anaerobes exposed air actually die peroxide poisoning peroxides poisonous anaerobes catalase survival value aerobes catalase surely even survival value anaerobe catalase exists protect aerobic cells peroxide poisoning expect catalase knockout mutations lethal least gravely deleterious yes let review basic facts first hydrogen peroxide toxic low concentrations words one researcher poorly reactive oxidize biological molecules including lipids dna proteins halliwell et al hydrogen peroxide ubiquitous cell culture vivo iubmb life pdf concentrated hydrogen peroxide toxic disinfectant dilute concentrations found living cells hydrogen peroxide anything harmful dna proteins lipids situation analogous hydrochloric acid high concentrations hcl eat skin put couple liters liter swimming pool though drink stuff peroxide secondly peroxides ubiquitous living systems see halliwell paper higher life forms ho produced vivo monoamine oxidase xanthine oxidases various dismutases enzymes homeostatic control substantial evidence hydrogen peroxide widely used signalling molecule see references halliwell paper recent work shown role hydrogen peroxide reparative neovascularization recruitment immune cells wounds likewise appears require hydrogen peroxide far toxic hydrogen peroxide important biomolecule essential ordinary metabolic processes zero evidence hydrogen peroxide anything harmful living tissues concentrations normally found vivo hydrogen peroxide toxic expect mutation knocks catalase would mean certain death host organism catalase break ho oxygen water hydrogen peroxide would simply accumulate reaching toxic levels turns naturally occurring catalase negative mutants staphylococcus aureas reported laboratory created catalase negative mutant strains coli organisms known well catalase knockout mice created develop normally humans lacking normal catalase first identified early japanese doctor found pouring hydrogen peroxide onto patient infected gums caused foaming catalase negative condition humans known acatalasemia acatalasia results pathology except increased tendency toward periodontal infection catalase serve important function aerobic organisms nothing detoxification catalase oxygen hydrogen peroxide scavenged reuse respiration important every oxygen molecule worth atp molecules aerobic breakdown glucose atp adenosine triphosphate high energy molecule powers chemical machinery cells without atp metabolism grinds halt comparison anaerobic breakdown glucose say fermentative breakdown yields atp molecules per sugar molecule much cell interest recycle oxygen hydrogen peroxide rather let go waste catalase makes reuse possible anaerobic bacteria obtain energy solely fermentation use oxygen therefore use catalase catalase gene would simply extra genetic baggage anaerobe would confer survival value astonishing me catalase myth version myth says catalase exists detoxify hydrogen peroxide keep cell dying free radical induced damage survived well hundred years without anyone questioning i see myth repeated internet gospel never i see substantiating research referenced support propagated one unquestioning drone another myths like take hold science otherwise intelligent scientists cling perpetuate regurgitating textbooks handing new generations students i think answer makes good story human beings value good story value checking story see true providing suitably satisfying story science stories human race way trying understand universe someone told good enough story story provided satisfying enough explanation something story endured humankind cherished stories survived thousands years survive many cases even verifiably true science theory unit storytelling theory seems fit facts accepted closer inspection story found fit facts still accepted many people satisfying enough story ancient greeks knew earth flat according diogenes laertius pythagoras first called earth round though theophrastus attributes parmenides zeno hesiod nevertheless took centuries flat earth theory fall disrepute even day people find flat earth theory
