wife i got back alaska august within days became progressively symptomatic influenza like illness appears peaking today day i know exactly infected several ill passengers particularly close proximity mastered coughing crook arm actually coughing sneezing top arm plane packed usual paid extra able sit economy comfort class fairness extra inches knees back seat front me i `` good day even could make severe ergonomic problems airplane seating i would quickly describe lack upright even upright position upright least degrees upright course hour flight create quite bit pain anyone back problem problem studied extent evidenced bullet point web page economy comfort class also comes free alcoholic beverages i saw one passenger clearly uncomfortable rapidly drinks ergonomic problem ill defined seat felt like sitting tennis balls way back focus viruses discussing problem friends family almost universal experience people get viral illnesses flight back recreational work destination i boarded cruise ship recently i screened gi symptoms asked i recent illnesses part check procedure happen point i got either direct flight minneapolis addition screening procedures hand sanitizer actively passively dispensed throughout ship ships tv channel following message played continuously basis please wash hands often use sanitizer stations provided throughout ship especially coming ashore always use fresh cup using beverage dispensers refrain using personal containers directly common beverage stations stay healthy wash hands soap warm water frequently comparing respiratory infections air travel norovirus infections cruise ships important differences norovirus infections occur well defined captive population specific time period outbreak occurs become widely known public relations detriment cruise line respiratory virus contracted flight everyone leaves plane arrival hours total number people infected unknown studies look attack rates people flight index case influenza also effects using masks prophylactically known index cases onboard cautions passengers prevent spread respiratory infections knowledge easy way cancel event develop acute upper respiratory infection cdc limited guidance air travel including information influenza transmission cabin air conditioning including fact partially recirculated hepa filtered times per hour interesting study microbial diversity commercial aircraft i could find osman et al compared conventional culture techniques available molecular probes samples domestic international flights conclude molecular probe techniques demonstrated much greater microbial diversity culture techniques microbes varied significantly domestic international flights molecular probe techniques identified classes species bacteria cabin air sufficiently low concentrations present health hazard i aware studies past done viral cultures respiratory viruses filters buildings could find similar data commercial aircraft already simulations happens person sneezes commercial aircraft results eye opening i posted look issue hand washing respiratory viruses rather go excessive detail limited research done far let me summarize facts conclusions respiratory viruses transmitted commercial air travel attack rate influenza virus estimated least one study shows masks prevent infection several simulations air travel potentially increases world wide spread airborne viral infections infections like corona virus sars outbreaks puts significant burden international public health community furthermore public health burden terms morbidity mortality huge influenza virus alone kills people annually united states equivalent large cruise ships terms total lives comparison far press coverage norovirus outbreak cruise ship virus much less fatal every american contracts respiratory viruses per year varying severity probably amounts weeks illness per year associated disruption work daily activities well increased infection risk sphere person routine also risk exacerbation chronic illnesses like asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease considerations lead me suggest minimum following measures intensification study airborne diseases especially respiratory viruses technology certainly reason molecular technologies applied samples commercial aircraft i think hepa filters logical place start i would really like see become focus private research fund seems like federal government created numerous monitoring systems practical ways detect high risk scenarios disrupt disease transmission seems like likely occur outbreak highly fatal respiratory virus occurs passenger education critical airline industry needs adopt methodologies currently employed cruise industry educating everyone plane screening passengers risk quarantining necessary critical piece education process hand washing necessary sufficient prevent spread airborne respiratory viruses public needs awareness concept else done method quarantine debatable would probably need flexibility based passenger needs acceptability severity problem could include grounding infection clears use masks block airborne infection possibly section passenger cabin intensive hepa filtering altering air flow humidity affect likelihood virus transmission developing culture reduce risk respiratory virus infection everywhere i look practices place encourage transmission respiratory viruses americans let respiratory viruses stop carrying business usual past days i personally walked clouds sneezed droplets i happened following fellow customer coworker closely wrong time i ca recall exactly happened getting rid sick vacation time replacing paid time pto days incentive going work sick sickness respiratory viruses american attitude common cold far casual take account spectrum symptom severity fact many viruses cause influenza like illnesses severe syndromes even cold moderate severity generally curtails lot activities produces significant morbidity i understand medical consumer community come level acceptance denial collection nuisance pathogens i would like see stop american attitude toward bad ergonomics airline seating another issue i think unfortunate passengers days never flown i may overidealizing flying youth planes today seem like dismal narrow aluminum tubes comparison george dawson md dfapa references osman la duc mt dekas
