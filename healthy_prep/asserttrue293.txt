term pseudogene coined jacq et al discovered version gene coding rrna african clawed frog xenopus laevis truncated yet retained homology active gene subsequent work shown higher life forms pseudogenes genes inactivated one event another almost numerous coding genes example human genome containing pseudogenes recent estimate puts number many pseudogenes highly conserved looking pseudogenes mouse human svensson et al found group genes occur species appear conserved since evolutionary divergence mice humans higher organisms pseudogenes sometimes transcribed rna rna filling regulatory function example korneev et al found simultaneous transcription neural nitric oxide synthase nnos antisense strand homologous pseudogene neurons lymnaea stagnalis snail leads formation duplex two strands reduction nnos translation examples found pink et al pseudogenes pseudo functional key regulators health disease bacteria pseudogenes somewhat rarer eukaryotes exist significant numbers many pathogens including many species mycobacterium shigella brucella bordetella others study kuo ochman found pseudogenes swiftly eliminated salmonella describe evidence strong deletional bias salmonella genes maintained selection rapidly inactivated eliminated mutational events fact kuo ochman found pseudogenes eliminated rapidly could explained called neutral theory evolution indicating continued presence pseudogenes exacts high cost cell yet many bacteria slow evolving genomes mycobacterium species retain pseudogenes high fidelity across evolutionary timespans celebrated pseudogene hoarder time leprae leprosy bacterium appears acquired pseudogenes million years ago meanwhile half life pseudogenes buchnera aphidicola measured million years staggering number one hand work kuo ochman showing pseudogenes bacteria rapidly eliminated hand bacterial lineages seems pseudogenes conserved actively repaired periods tens millions years chapter brucella molecular microbiology genomics caister academic press garcia lobo et al describe work rna sequence data bacterium brucella abortus twenty four genes selected rnaseq data annotated pseudogenes abortus genome considered rather unexpected finding comparison brucella genomes reduce list highly expressed pseudogenes often truncated parts gene annotated different pseudogenes especially abortus seems contradictory since high transcription genes able translate functional proteins contrary biological economy high levels transcription observed genes strongly suggest could active genes products may perform functions unreported metabolic reconstructions high pseudogene expression may also indicate recently produced pseudogenes turned transcription yet accumulation mutations promoter control regions also possible pseudogenes may contain sequencing errors indeed active genes almost comically obvious passage authors troubled finding pseudogenes brucella highly transcribed try explaining away saying could sequencing errors parsimonious view pseudogenes eliminated genome fact permanent legitimate fixtures landscape microbes higher life forms higher life forms pseudogenes microbes probably serving perfectly understandable regulatory functions actually translated protein products kuo ochman convincingly shown useless pseudogenes quickly eliminated follows pseudogenes swiftly eliminated fact serving biological purpose else would line reasoning already well accepted researchers study eukaryotic life forms study bacteria need take hint food chain colleagues could hundreds pseudogenes bordetella pertussis pseudogenes
