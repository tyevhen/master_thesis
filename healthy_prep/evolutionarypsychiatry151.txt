long long long ago i wrote several posts later updated psychology today mostly basis understanding pathology depression regards big bad diseases civilization inflammation nice tie posts depression crashed party perhaps friendliest posts biochemistry rest assured vital importance especially diagram right click open new page take look post particularly friendly either mostly i caught recent skirmish war medicine psychiatry begun book reviews former editor chief new england journal medicine dr marcia angell big names psychiatry writers specifically article psychiatric times ronald pies misunderstanding psychiatry philosophy highest level case happen clinical psychiatrist care dive debate let me paraphrase allow me take extreme liberty interpretation stance two sides dr angell psychiatrists witch doctors psychiatrists ignorant misinformed music danse diabolique right click open new tab hard misunderstood rest assured i rely incantations treat patients i dislike equating psychiatry dsmiv dsmiv cookbook describing diagnoses research insurance billing purposes psychiatry good psychiatrist listens measures watches neurologic disorders medical symptoms experience emotions emotional expression tremor eye contact muscle tone gait ever mentioned dsmiv i consider dsmiv necessary evil clever former teacher mine said copies dsmiv dropped bottom ocean better worse fishes asked i repeat anyone i wo attach name details changed protect innocent always i cope well meaning witch doctor i write blog i tear apart pathologies dsmiv context biology biochemistry nutrition lifestyle evolution me sensible tenable approach random crapshoot modern medicine epidemiology biased minefield psychopharmacology research little corner blogosphere i feel safe honest going right direction time back depression crashing party i talked quite bit serotonin term i think everyone familiar nice article serotonin case missed serotonin small piece whole story friendly neighborhood amino acid tryptophan become sorts things happy satiating serotonin enervating irritating kynurenic many like pioneering researcher dr maes hopped case western reserve respectable antwerp i sure respectable thailand well let reserve judgment know whys wherefores though thailand lovely place hotspot respectable biomedical research talking inflammation kynurenic decade finally researchers looking call kynurenine i going quibble new generation researchers working respectable new york state psychiatric institute measured kynurenine levels healthy controls patients major depressive disorders patients major depressive disorders suicide attempts past controls three depressed patients study medication free low behold found previous suicide attempt significantly likely higher levels serum kynurenine let back activation inflammatory cascade theoretically via autoimmune mechanisms like say go paleo limb wheat omega fatty acids increases activity enzyme called ido indoleamine dioxygenase change amino acid tryptophan kynurenine rather fat happy serotonin serotonin levels actually closer negative correlation violence suicide depressed mood study kynurenine different suicide attempters higher levels depressed patients without attempts similar levels healthy controls interestingly kynurenine levels correlate bmi tryptophan levels robustly males females males higher risk suicide completion females though females suicide attempts previous studies autopsies suicide victims cns samples suicide survivors shown increased levels kynurenine mouse studies increased kynurenine associated activation neurotoxic excess glutamate even dopamine increases motivation drive stress seems increase activity ido leading increased conversion tryptophan kynurenine general suicide badness end i say psychologic biologic psychiatrists must keep eye signs symptoms dsmiv psychiatry skeptics ignores signs otherwise remain guilty criticisms likes dr biffra levy according comment number shows little understanding job psychiatrist normally i like dr biffra ideas clearly needs consult expert psychiatrists writing posts ultimately i surprised mental illness understood psychiatrists hold keys temple sometimes easier eject misunderstood rather absorb understand regardless biology morality little editorial addition i thought writing ongoing controversies psychiatry may interest many readers though i several clinical psychiatrists follow blog hey blog i write interests me opens me fairly enough defender modern clinical psychiatry i critiquing critic i interested role defender certainly aspects modern psychiatry indeed modern medicine indefensible role ably taken drs altschuler nierenberg friedman pies among others written responses dr angell reviews however i think critiques psychiatry important entirely unreasonable risk atheoretical document like dsmiv diagnosis based list symptoms divorced pathology purpose profit driven pharmaceutical research community create diagnoses make pills fit diagnoses ultimate argument critique lot mental illness essentially made main objection dr angell stance sentence quoted dr pies article linked starts saying psychiatry different medical specialties first mental illness diagnosed basis symptoms medically defined subjective manifestations disease pain behaviors signs defined objective manifestations swelling joint i mentioned mental illness presents many objective physical signs known neuropathologic basis signs used time clinical psychiatry dr angell would know fact betrays rather shocking ignorance addition biomarkers mental illness zinc one kynurenine likely another various cytokines fact biomarker tests marketed psychiatrists diagnosis depression hard convince psychiatrist jab someone needle spend money test merely ask person symptoms depression find answer i suppose might eventually useful cases people feigning depression monetary gain faked disability case i suggest objective sign known pathology make pharmacology less faustian bargain objective medical specialties sure reflux send scope someone esophagus measure ph medicine used treat indeed change ph via blocking proton pump helping overall pathology acid reflux long run statins indeed lower cholesterol known mechanism despite standard line doctors idea cholesterol less important statin commercials tell every well trained intellectually curious primary care doctor i speak regular basis knows statins work via somewhat mysterious anti inflammatory effect cholesterol lowering effect sulfanylurea drugs used boost insulin production type ii diabetes sure improve situation short term could possibly avert long term hyperglycemia damage making patient hyperinsulinemic process looking longer term risks worsening diabetes depending medication seems increased risks pancreatic cancer heart disease i would suggest knowing almost invariably incomplete pathology lab tests check gives modern medical doctors false sense security many cases i saying throw baby bathwater ca scapegoat psychiatry without holding specialties modern medicine accountable critique well pharmacology whether psych drugs medical drugs pharmacologic use supplements always unknown risks along benefits add risks using pharmacology whether medical psychiatric complicated picture risks outcome one takes good training bit humility honesty time figure
