today i want give short bio hacking code lesson i want keep simple possible case starting use javascript want see kinds things lesson could prove handy even gene hacker shows easy manipulate text browser example i going assume text file open browser particular i going assume text file consists listing two genes sequences fasta format actually simple fasta consists header line starts greater angle bracket followed one lines agtc base sequence data nucleotide sequence bunch letters kprmiv etc protein sequence example leprae mblr header atggcggtgctggatgtc data file might several genes fasta format one question read data javascript actually extremely easy read text data open text file browser open javascript window firefox use shift f bring scratchpad chrome use control shift read text javascript variable called text type following line script editor text document body textcontent execute code control l firefox simply entering carriage return chrome firefox fills scratchpad text bracketed good means code worked delete proceed suppose several fasta records row want array gene data easy thing split records header discarding header r genes text split r note enter one line code chrome console hold shift key hitting enter otherwise enter executes code first line defines regular expression r pattern greater symbol followed one non newline symbols followed newline caret symbol means negate whatever square brackets code executes genes array data way split works first item item zero array empty get rid genes shift genes array contain gene data data gene gene data gene gene etc incidentially want array headers headers text match r need headers shift match operation creates exact array genes aligned compare base base loop genes aligned create alignment using online clustalw alignment tool using popular mega program following loop construct compares first bases two genes tallies differences according whether difference occurred codon base one base two base three snp array hold base results gene genes gene genes var i i i snp i gene i gene i display results console simply adding line snp console logsnp want see dialog execute alertsnp final line code deserves explanation results placed snp single nucleotide polymorphism array according whether hit occurred base base base codon i construct i modulo means divide i throw away answer keep remainder example equals equals zero equals etc i increments i simply takes values etc right side equals sign gene i gene i means want compare two genes offset i equal tally resulting value true numerically numeric result added appropriate slot snp note javascript treats true numeric value one false numeric value zero knows cast boolean value number symbol means numerically add following value existing value lefthand variable i hope short tutorial painful new javascript advice experiment console firefox scratchpad chrome js console lot get familiar string functions split match incredibly useful mention speedy either two functions take string argument regex remember put 'g regex want operation occur globally throughout string example abcdefabcdef match abc match first occurrence abc whereas abcdefabcdef match abc match occurrences abc give array matches
