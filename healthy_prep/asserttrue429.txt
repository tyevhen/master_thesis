everybody wants know causes aging done turns know lot aging know little prevent theories aging proposed thoroughly researched far free radical theory aging properly called oxidative stress theory aging years since denham harman first proposed senescence driven buildup oxidative damage dna biological macromolecules since extensive research verified repeatedly tissues age fact accumulate wide variety types oxidative damage oxidative stress theory aging see many foods days labeled rich antioxidants supposedly antioxidants like vitamin beta carotene confer resistance heart disease ailments food supplement makers forbidden law making specific therapeutic claims around antioxidants restriction actually boon marketers nameless benefits accrue antioxidants whatever conjured buyer mind much greater force power anything label ad could possibly say way person watching horror movie make monster even scarier imagination monster actually shown screen federal trade commission made kellogg stop using immunity claim tied antioxidants cereal packaging packaging see discontinued notice badge seems imply daily value antioxidants thing bogeyman case goes name reactive oxygen species ros covers lot ground chemically originally ros meant free radicals breakdown products peroxides perfect bogeyman free radicals fleeting concentrations living cells ca even measured chemically reactive last nanosecond days ros also refer superoxides aldehydes formaldehyde anything else reactive contains oxygen conveniently vague category scary stuff way bogeyman research works science new mediator tissue damage first identified example nitric oxide superoxide anion prostaglandins leukotrienes interleukin interleukin tumor necrosis factor alpha researchers rush measure host human animal diseases soon molecule question implicated pathogenesis various diseases problem finding xyz bogey molecule implicated disease thing finding causes disease free radicals implicated hundred diseases gutteridge jmc free radicals disease processes compilation cause consequence free radic res commun cause none recently impossible show cause effect relationship oxidative stress aging know two linked know causal fashion recent work genetically modified mice may finally provided much needed clarification role oxidative stress aging i referring work done viviana p rez colleagues university texas health science center san antonio texas published p rez looked life extending reducing effects various mutations involving oxidative enzymes mice idea knock certain oxidative damage repair genes mice age prematurely live whereas amplify upregulate certain damage repair genes mice show fewer signs aging maybe live longer p rez results take explain worth looking carefully sheds much needed light question whether aging actually caused oxidative damage converse p rez team looked genetically modified mice lacked glutathione peroxidase gpx major scavenger intracellular peroxides found surprisingly mice lived normal age showed pathology however mice deficient glutathione peroxidase genetic marker gpx embryonic lethal latter finding tends support free radical oxidative stress theory enzyme called methionine sulfoxide reductase msra repairs oxidized methionine residues proteins may also function general antioxidant p rez et al found mice null msra lived normal lifespan even though showed additional sensitivity oxidative stress thioredoxin trx plays important role repairing oxidation cysteine residues proteins turns trx null mice embryonic lethal trx heterozygous mice one copy gene instead normal two longer maximum lifespan two major superoxide dismutases break superoxides cells cuznsod mnsod genetic markers sod sod p rez et al found mice lacking former suffer reduction mean maximum lifespan mice lacking latter die within days birth recap far mice null sod gpx non viable null sod shorter lives results tend support free radical theory knockout mice lacking msra trx live normal lifespans contradicts free radical theory interpret results one problem knockout studies certain chemical reaction occur responsible enzyme system taken away knocked genetically difficult know whether resulting harm host due buildup unreacted precursor molecules rather absence crucial end products end products reaction might vital downstream metabolism might simply precursors reaction toxic hydrogen peroxide end product superoxide dismutases important signalling molecule recent work seems indicate would expect abnormalities sod sod harmful indeed reasons nothing aging bottom line finding mice lacking sod sod gpx unhealthy sufficient vindicate oxidative stress theory ultimate test oxidative stress theory would see whether mice show fewer signs aging less dna damage age actually live longer enzymes involved combating oxidative stress increased expressed p rez team tried exactly approach mentioned two major superoxide dismutases break superoxides cells cuznsod mnsod genetic markers sod sod mice made express sod two five times normal activity cuznsod enzyme mice indeed resistant oxidative stress measured standard tests involving tolerance paraquat diquat mice lived longer ordinary mice observed mice expressed sod p rez et al created mice expressed catalase enzyme degrades hydrogen peroxide water oxygen found mice less prone dna damage lived longer normal mice upregulated glutathione enhanced protection various kinds oxidative stress demonstrated mice lived longer normal wild type animals p rez group also tried expressing one antioxidative gene combination produced lifespan extension recap mice live longer express antioxidant enzymes singly combinations even though show heightened protection dna damage lipid damage typical signatures oxidative stress p rez et al concluded believe fact lifespan altered majority knockout transgenic mice strong evidence oxidative stress damage playing major role molecular mechanism aging mice hard disagree conclusion genetic manipulations p rez et al tried inspired fruit fly experiments gave much encouraging results mammals fruit flies seems unlikely me results reported p rez et al kind fluke limited mice seems unlikely entirely different results would found humans altogether p rez et al tried different genetic manipulations one extended life mice me means put oxidative stress bogeyman bed go worry things whatever keeping living oxidative stress subject see recent post big think
