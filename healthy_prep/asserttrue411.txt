earlier i gave evidence surprising relationship amount guanine plus cytosine dna amount purine loading message strand coding regions fact message strands often purine rich new course called szybalski rule new unexpected amount genome lets predict amount purine loading also szybalski rule always right genome content versus message strand purine content bacterial genera chargaff second parity rule predicts horizontal line szybalski rule says points lie surprisingly approaches approaches golden ratio look coding regions many different bacterial species find species dna content tends purines pyrimidines message strand thus purine rich mrna hand organism extremely gc rich dna gene message strand tends pyrimidines purines means szybalski rule correct organisms genome content less chargaff second parity rule says even within single strand dna flat wrong time except point chargaff right chance since last time i wrote subject i chance look additional genomes i found relationship purine loading content applies bacteria archaea eukaryotes mitochondrial dna chloroplast dna virus genomes plant animal phage well accompanying graphs tell story i explain change way graphs prepared versus graphs earlier posts earlier i plotted along axis purine pyrmidine ratio axis i plot axis instead order convert inverse relationship direct relationship also i plot purines mole fraction axis thus axes expressed mole fractions hence normalized unit interval i values range graph shows relationship genome content purine content message strands genomes bacterial genera straight line regression fitted minimize sum squared absolute error software zunzun line conforms bx line predicts genome consist entirely guanine cytosine would guanine whereas mythical creature genome consist entirely adenine thymine adenine would comprise dna interestingly confidence interval permits value would mean guanine cytosine diminish zero approaches golden ratio primitive bacteria archaea also obey relationship yes preparing graph i analyzed codon usage archaeal genera obtain relative proportions coding regions genes see basic relationship exists purine content archaea eubacteria regression analysis yielded line slope vertical offset possible maybe strange coincidence approaches golden ratio approaches unity analysis coding regions archaea reveals relationship exists content purine mole fraction exists eubacteria graph i analyzed eukaryotic genomes everything fungi protists insects fish worms flowering non flowering plants mosses algae sundry warm cold blooded animals slope generated regression line vertical offset eukaryotic organisms mitochondria chloroplasts see two graphs show good bit scatter data regression analysis still comes back positive slopes respectively line least squared absolute error mitochondrial dna chloroplast dna see fundamental relationship might hold even viral genetic material i looked codon usage varieties bacteriophage plant animal viruses ranging size kb kilobases interestingly enough relationship message strand purine loading indeed apply viruses despite absence dedicated protein making machinery virion plant animal viruses bacteriophage plant animal viruses left regression line slope meets axis bacteriophage right line slope vertical offset inspecting graphs take note vertical axis scaling graph hence slopes deceptive intercept possible approaches golden ratio approaches fact viral nucleic acids follow purine trajectories hosts perhaps come surprise viral genetic material general highly adapted host machinery purine loading appropriate milieu another adaptation striking many genomes many diverse organisms eubacteria archaea eukaryotes viruses bacteriophages plus organelles follow basic law approximately law universal law biology i ever seen question call slope term clearly biological constant considerable significance physical interpretation clear rate purines accumulated mrna genome content increases says increase content decrease genome content worth increase purine content message strands maybe called purine rise rate purine amelioration rate biologists please feel free get touch discuss i interested hearing ideas reach me linkedin simply leave comment
