committed heinous crimes like violent sexual offenses sexual offenses minors one point large numbers persons state mental hospitals two historic movements resulted large numbers patients released first deinstitutionalization movement historian edward shorter attributes start deinstitutionalization psychopharmacology specifically invention chlorpromazine fda approved according shorter total number patients state county mental hospitals declined high low decrease reality many discharged patients take medication reliably developed side effects shorter credits antipsychiatry movement providing continued impetus state hospital discharges suggesting institutions could replaced therapeutic communities romanticized version welcoming friends neighbors clasping mentally ill bosoms also credits national institute mental health promoting view movement led large numbers mentally ill persons homeless cared medically physically dwindling resources outpatient medical care community mental health centers started focus providing psychotherapy people without severe mental illnesses treatment advocacy center looks available bed per population rate put minimum acceptable figure beds beds per number dwindled average range according report states less minimum recommended number copy shorter text published says nothing managed care era effect managed care state hospital systems community systems care supposed treat deinstitutionalized systems outset beginning larger community psychiatry movement experts began develop systems care support patients state hospitals community systems care far exceptions rather rule managed care took longer asylum containment function community hospitals people severe mental illnesses could longer go short term hospitals longer able function numerous problems difficult managed outpatient setting reason hospitalization managed care concept dangerousness suddenly longer mattered manic squandering resources ruining marriage losing job unless suicidality detected threats kill somebody person would discharged emergency department anything said emergency department taken face value patient could tearing home obviously paranoid threatening neighbor long person said intent harm anyone else would discharged even family bringing hospital horrified decision state managed care impact psychiatry even day reason quite clear several studies shown adequate community treatment persons mental illness may less expensive state hospital treatment providing rationed treatment state health care company saves money also referred cost effective care people rationing care interesting twist spin put deinstitutionalization i know one leading proponents process individual supervisor i still recall presentation became interested community psychiatry one leaders single black white photo large gymnasium sized room state hospital hundred men photo room enough cots arranged edge edge across floor never let said state hospitals luxurious places begin fact alone one main reasons psychiatrists interested getting patients shadow state hospital system first level administrative one administrative systems state hospital systems always fairly intensive point predictable scandal political reaction fact many hospitals mismanaged political system first place another case politicians reinventing reforming something mismanaged first place clear examples include following people psychiatric illnesses used pack state hospitals pack jails emergency departments one primary goals shadow state hospital give public impression humane effective treatment real state hospitals run psychiatrists also effectively removes large block people chronic mental illness active treatment relationships psychiatrists family advocates patients psychiatrists unite advocate patients neutralized system managed allow minute appointments psychiatrist per year rationing point absurd theme crops regular basis time true whether asylum psychiatrist seeing patients hospital serious injuries staff patients occurs another goal shadow state hospital give impression matter administrators somehow special knowledge run psychiatric services nothing could truth psychiatrists end jumping large number administrative hoops since caught endless stream bureaucracy less less time direct patient contact bureaucrats appreciation clinical medicine lack appreciation two critical factors psychiatry factors quality assessments patient problem depends time spent direct contact patient quality intervention including prescription medication also depends time spent patient together time relationship patient best predictor outcome administrative measures shadow state hospital seem designed negatively impact parameter including replacement psychiatrists prescribers shadow state hospital really need psychiatrists despite fact psychiatrists far training group physicians mental health professionals hospital care care patients serious mental illness administrative focus general elimination psychiatrists i think makes perfect sense administrative side administrator accountable politicians government bureaucrats eliminating psychiatrists accomplishes two goals first taking professional opposition measures decide implement perspective person little training treatment mental illness second group professional employees scapegoat better arrangement could hiring people overworked point little time left muster opposition plans overworking dangerous environment puts risk adverse events ultimately blamed events predictable outcome people working split environment collecting data citizens reasons psychiatric care address ongoing problem gun violence mentally ill many states adopted legislation allows bureaucrat collect data people committed purpose putting master list prevent acquiring firearms number people denied manner small compared domestic violence perpetrators felons prevent false solution problem gun violence cost collecting data many states way get existing mental health facilities civil commitment also process collecting financial data population purpose collecting money cost hospitalization ethically correct forcibly collect fees people resources court ordered get treatment i think apparently state county governments creating administrative burdens adequate treatment people previously treated state hospitals foster care settings minnesota recent ruling developmentally disabled patients state hospital secluded restrained excessively resulted long court ruling applied incident resulted financial reward members class action suit closing hospital several administrative procedures started affect providers adult foster care one case administration needed medication including sedatives sleep anti anxiety medications antipsychotic medications required foster care provider go online complete page report even extra doctor ordered doses medication per week results tremendous paper work burden burden created people stable foster care situations years receiving excellent medical psychiatric care prevention violence care violent aggressive patient community bothersome situation several years ago friend mine told me son involved staffing small group home specialized treatment support violent mentally ill patients adult foster care setting patient aggressive staff would use pads hold patient floor aggression passed i shocked hear arrangement onsite supervision training anyone specializing treatment containment physically aggressive person mental illness treating behavior hospital setting well trained staff clear support administration difficult enough seems mini facilities trying provide level containment aggression residential buildings staff site use limited state hospital resources political purposes continues best example commitment psychopathy sexual offenses disorders treatment considered psychiatric disorders cases legal authorities people committing sexual offenses hospitalized indefinitely people severe mental illnesses refused admission hospitals eventually incarcerated minor crimes shadow system large population mentally ill persons continuously cycling emergency department ed brief ineffective stays short term psychiatric units jail constant churning typically covered press reason overcrowding ed real travesty patients never get psychiatric social problems resolved keeps cycling discharging person severe mental illness short term psychiatric unit ed solve anything person nothing expensive time family hospital staff always prevalent since i recall violent aggressive patients cared home point entire home trashed family members patient question frequent severe injuries short scenario much common today family becomes default hospital staff cases person severe mental illness meet managed care dangerousness criteria admission means patient tell emergency room physician social worker going kill become aggressive family members recognize person needs supervision monitoring hours day days week i really never met family could couple days course never put position especially fees taxes every family pays health care country anybody requires supervision care professional staff offer appropriate therapy maintain neutral relationship affected person money war cry managed care systems government systems government systems managed like managed care systems cost effectiveness known since hay report psychiatric mental health systems took disproportionate hit relative areas medicine never really informed discussion reasonable budget provision mental health services cost services often impossible find bureaucratic recipe transferring money somewhere else even standard bureaucratic solutions like budgetary cut across board obviously hit marginally funded systems first hardest services psychiatric services shadow state hospital system function funding source projects cost providing treatment persons severe mental illness let pretend real state hospital system front end illusion usually starts person actually meets managed care dangerousness criteria hospital case managers discharge case court usually assists hospital getting patient example used system commit patients substance use problems treatment patients frequently released courts basis longer chemical dependency commitments case severely disabled patients mental illness court may ignore standard state commitment statutes release person imminently dangerous cases patient hospitalized days longer day managed care length stay instead committed system care appears though something occurred really shadow state hospital system allows state partners private business establish covert control mental health system care detriment professionals patients system exact number administrative measures facilities like ones i outlined unknown shadow systems thrive lack transparency least next scandal happens point seems level transparency always incomplete real story happened never seems surface real state hospitals systems far perfect time medical accountability replace government bureaucrats weak standard accountability
