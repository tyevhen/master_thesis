gold mine anti drugs pro therapy maybe pro seizure drugs depakote lamictal anti antipsychotics way around maybe mentor gets az money used pay salary university maybe nih stake getting expensive drugs like seroquel look bad catie journals worse think editors journal biases even direct pharma ones three peer reviewers ever wondered articles get accepted publication i say someone pretty high rate publication success journals publish public data cost yr ca accessed public first important step fixing medicine abandoning journal system articles including raw data generated photos scientific notebooks etc go online let world vet data i agree great majority said i find hard believe nih expensive medications since many nih folks ties drug companies course pushing newer expensive meds keep mind whole scientific peer review process includes lot bias let review studies go set numbers published manuscript may sound like dull process foundation called evidence base medicine actually important understand biased let me count ways step analyzing data writing paper researchers transform bunch numbers paper anyone guess whether researchers actually seen data upon base writings cases unlikely company could already made alterations data unclear often happens certainly possibility hopefully rare instances company analyze data way sees fit go aubrey blumsohn site excellent example problematic company statisticians cook books either overtly subtle manner like seroquel data company interpret numbers way wants example someone committed suicide taking drug drug could caused patient committed suicide placebo placebo caused even data favorable positive conclusions reached instances example company bury unfavorable data suppose depression measured five different ways couple

editors frequently huge ties industry google names many editors find received funding lot different sources also know sometimes peer reviewers make good comments yet editor chooses ignore note nearly journals profit entity make money advertising subscriptions reprints journal runs article favorable industry saying vagus nerve stimulation great depression example likely company buy thousands reprints dissemination physicians journal making good money reprint make tens thousands even million dollars reprints study study unfavorable irrelevant industry going generate revenue journal business standpoint makes sense print studies like written slant favoring product run something less industry friendly start making trial information publicly available last psychiatrist said richard
