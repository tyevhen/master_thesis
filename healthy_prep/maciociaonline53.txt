spaces membranes spaces abdominal cavity cavities called cou chinese medicine term cou usually used conjunction li meaning texture although term cou li often used indicate space skin muscles space one cavities body cavities body generally irrigated lubricated various fluids triple burner controls cavities also controls transformation transportation excretion fluids parts body moreover triple burner controls movement cavities movement entering exiting mechanism discussed last clinical tip entering exiting cavities extremely important proper circulation transformation transportation body fluids cavities abdominal cavity contains membranes huang include superficial deep fascia mesentery omentum stroma enveloping internal organs superficial deep fascia connective tissues envelope muscles mesentery double layer peritoneum attached abdominal wall enclosing fold abdominal viscera omentum fold peritoneum passing stomach another abdominal organ stroma framework usually connective tissue

controlling waterways governing movement controlling cavities inter related depend example transformation fluids depends ascending descending entering exiting body cavities clinical application regard triple burner governing body cavities i would single two areas clinical significance first space skin muscles generally referred cou li space although term encompasses spaces space wei circulates sweat interpret space skin muscles strict western anatomical sense literally space skin muscles anatomic sense energetic sense exterior body wei circulates luo channels course triple burner regulates entering exiting wei sweat space function normal sweating physiological much little wei circulates normally protects invasions external pathogenic factors entering prevails exiting cou li space said tight closed happens person sweat enough succumbs invasion wind sweat temperature exiting prevails entering space said lax open consolidated happens person suffer spontaneous sweating suffer invasion wind temperature also prone invasions wind regulate cou li space one needs regulate triple burner wei points lu lieque lu taiyuan l i hegu st zusanli bl feishu example consolidate cou li space one use
