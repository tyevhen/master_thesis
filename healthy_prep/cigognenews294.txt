stronger less anxious turns mothers licked groomed early lives experience could passed genes could modified methyl group also chemicals beneficent way good history mother good childhood children loving mother less methylation child less chronic stress hormone production far less chance serious diseases later alzheimer make sure changes rat pups resulted experience hereditary let normally stable rat pups raised neurotic negligent mothers result still unstressed babies babies mothers normal amounts methyl systems thus rats raised loving mothers could pass onto offspring even adopted mother loving genes stress hormone output minimal methylation words love passed genetic chain normal babies raised negligent inattentive mothers still low methyl levels hippocampus babies started life one leg good start life despite bad childhood i believe changes genes methylation acetylation must occur early whole neuronal system evolving state causes depression anxiety need observe early epigenetics work pups born unloving mothers handed loving mothers born bad mothers reared loving mothers still seemed normal relatively un methylated one reason research important found unloving mothers rodents causes methylation estrogen receptors female offspring offspring offspring deficient estrogen made less attentive loving babies yet know many key chemical processes affected lack early love idea many hormones changed neurotic mothers heavily methylated affects myriad adult behaviors depression inherited may precursors never manifested plenty love later childhood tendency methylation inherited epigenetically passed form basis depression seems research cited neurotic mothers methylated ineluctably forced unloving thus laying groundwork depression offspring later hormones depleted scenario born tendency anxiety possibly imprint methyl much acetyl case acetylation faults repressive system holes gating system acetylation recruiting acetyl pretty much produces opposite methylation tendency open rather close early trauma produced heavy methylation children grew orphanages process affected much terms brain neuronal development find mother loving need know may driven epigenes victim changes cortisol stress hormone level militates maternal instincts methylation shuts number natural behaviors neurosis natural appreciate nature disconnected alienated nature rely feelings guide effectively shut alienated literally feelings aliens found patients verge feelings sessions often run fever body treats feelings menace danger something avoided yet also liberate reverse undo methylation research informs rats damaged raised unloving mothers infused trichostatin show evident damage though trauma never occurred drug removes methyl system brief undo history i think may happening patients reliving must change methylation reverse history shall study future research projects seems me natural way provides far less possibility collateral damage system since already found chronically high cortisol levels reversed therapy would perhaps follow methylation could also reversed way levels methylation marker loved early loved could tell statements person claims loved childhood indeed loved much denial neurochemistry may better relied reason lie know even possible marker post traumatic stress much repression exists add much pain repression alzheimer disease already information regard autopsies depressive suicides found heavily methylated hippocampal area abuse child cases methylation produced add future research telomeres cortisol begin precise measures pain know drug dangerous particularly drugs like marijuana tend open feelings pain finally marker efficacy certain psychotherapies therapy undo past help relieve repression therefore depression great first line pain anxiety states seems case love obviates methylation produces normal souls
