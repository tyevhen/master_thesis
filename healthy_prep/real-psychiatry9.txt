arthur barsky wrote article week jama entitled iatrogenic potential physician words dr barsky one authors i reading past years psychiatrist expert psychosomatic medicine like number authors i see name i read article automatic article brief contains lot wisdom communication patients affect expected outcome medical treatment several points article jump experienced clinician followed many patients single important sentence article starts second paragraph somatic symptoms underlying disease fixed invariable one one equivalence physicians course trained see multitude presentations illness influenza good example majority people ill common cold significant number critically ill dying example cdc estimated million people got flu hospitalized died theoretically number people symptoms still spread virus significant number factors disease vector host determine wide array outcomes infectious diseases provide straightforward example variability symptoms underlying illnesses outcome chronic complex polygenic illnesses require ongoing medical care situation less clear case patient constantly updating assessment problems symptoms state illness make similar determinations medicine treatment physician wants take significant part determination based information obtain physician sources importantly presented psychiatric perspective presented neutral possible patients vary greatly reactions even fairly dry information example i typically provide patients medlineplus information medications i consider documents present essential unbiased information still common encounter people tell me give me doctor i know i read i get every side effect listed i honor request reassure call me problems dr barsky focuses informed consent aspect treatment information presented affect patients reaction treatment gives examples men warned sexual side effects beta blockers getting roughly twice much sexual dysfunction back pain patients undergoing spine imaging pain functional impairment physician visits psychiatry additional burden many vocal critics promoting side effect burden medications often point seems like conspiracy cover results patients office complaining read online even informed consent discussion begins discussion nocebo effect adverse effects placebo treatment receive enough discussion within medicine i early familiarity phenomenon work clinical trials pharmaceuticals antidepressants anxiolytics antipsychotics case active drug compared placebo patients followed closely days allowed break blind tell patients active drug placebo first time i encountered nocebo effect i treating young man experimental anxiety medication bitterly complained many side effects initially second third visit said could longer stand needed taken medication making extremely ill i broke blind told taking inert placebo somewhat embarrassed symptoms resolved time sitting office since i seen nocebo effect hundreds time clinical practice many predisposed claim high sensitivity allergy multiple medications warn me ahead time need start lowest possible dose medication even dicey years led me develop uniform informed consent decision designed minimize nocebo effect i think fairly straightforward provide relevant information manner transmits side effect also likelihood developing side effect patient worst case scenarios never avoided example i always warn people serotonergic medications risk serotonin syndrome fact lethal i also let know chances developing serotonin syndrome low i use approach tardive dyskinesia tardive syndromes diabetes mellitus cardiac arrhythmias metabolic syndrome seizures neutropenia agranulocytosis neuroleptic malignant syndrome also give estimate likely develop side effect often i seen side effect years practice approach seems expected effect false positive reports symptoms fact i much likely notice threshold symptoms hypophonia micrographia etc people i warn side effects second tier symptoms surrounds issues sexual side effects weight gain significant number people averse trying medication might result either side effect occur even want take medication situation useful comprehensive reference described entire range side effects clinical trials specific medications present facts facts generally illustrate side effect concern universal means addressed happens case sexual side effects proactively least cases case increased appetite weight gain given long list potential side effects reassurance assessed plan put place address best approach informed consent discussion people find reassuring i low threshold stopping medication causes side effect patient finds distressing residency i experience stopping antidepressant medication patient years complaining primarily flu like syndrome headaches medication stopped symptoms cleared entirely since incident i routinely advice patients i advise try get used medications i would prefer stop medication causing problems try different approach possible barsky invokes viscerosomatic amplification likely cause information affecting symptom perception provides interesting supplement outlining process whereby benign noticeable bodily sensations disease symptoms varying intensity biased information provided physician leading feedback loop increasing anxiety vigilance reactivity psychiatrists used treating anxiety disorders probably familiar mechanism i routinely ask patients cardiac awareness aware heart beating lay awake bed night waiting fall asleep intense like entire body pulsating theory happening concerned something wrong heart phenomenon suggests anxiety plays significant role selective attention hypervigilance internally focused also suggests major role temperament personality factors hypervigilance process since many patients experience anxiety level concrete steps minimize symptom amplification process discussed logically follow proposed mechanism meaning patient symptoms needs explored education provided nocebo effect amplification process i typically use research vignette nocebo discussion purported evolutionary aspects anxiety results theories including somatic theories good starting point article suggests contextualized informed consent useful method enumerating benign nonspecific symptoms patient consent often practical matter given length rare nonspecific symptoms included package inserts days patient present i consider rare side effect i look session give ballpark estimate common clinical trials discuss potential causes article also points side effects also point problems physician patient relationship psychiatrists training therapeutic neutrality often encounter difficulties dependent patients frequently present tolerating medication suggestion addition typical prescription scenarios dynamic applies important clinical scenarios treating acute chronic pain case point probably better example patient expectations based physician advice prescribing relationship opioids involved scenario complicated medication reinforces use physician discussing medication response bias patient direction dose escalation context perceived incomplete response pain chronic pain respond completely opioid analgesia many cases entire illnesses result problematic information supplied physicians cases chronic lyme disease extremes many patients go including application devices constitute medical quackery another example best approach cases discuss patient theory current symptoms anxiety amplifies symptoms point alternate plausible theory distress discussed often results significant improvement resolution symptoms i ca recommend brief article dr barsky enough read understood psychiatric trainees practicing psychiatrists concepts critical discussions patients treatment plan order
