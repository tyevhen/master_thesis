i first heard pattern matching importance medical diagnosis years ago friend mine medical school time told me one professors always interested augenblick diagnosis diagnosis could arrived blink eye gave me examples several diagnoses could either made immediately within minutes based set features would lead immediate associations mind clinician without extensive evaluation i many encounters medical training phenomenon i recall infectious disease consult team asked see patient ascites possible diagnosis treatment spontaneous bacterial peritonitis consultant expert streptococcal infections patiently listening resident presentation asked thought rash patient leg patient lower extremity edema slightly erythematous hue slight exudate areas diagnosis without skipping beat consultant said streptococcal cellulitis suggested sending sample lab confirmation subsequently confirmed treated attending physician able hone diagnose rash escaped detection two medicine residents two medical students infectious disease specialist may biased direction something else one ways physicians probably classes diagnosticians arrive augenblick diagnoses efficiently clump sort larger amounts information faster pattern matching pattern matching also reason clinical training necessary become adequate diagnostician happen rote learning alone one thing read heart sounds actually experience skill refined listening hundreds thousands normal hearts hearts varying degrees pathology rashes classic examples several studies documented speed accuracy dermatologists make accurate diagnosis rash much higher average physician pattern matching recognizable feature patient illness triggers immediate association physicians experiences past leading facilitated diagnosis probably best conceptualizations pattern matching comes fields philosophy cognitive science favorite author andy clarke book microcognition addresses issue biologically relevant cognitive science model parallel distributed processing simplified diagram drawn model shown case practical problem patient known bipolar disorder question whether stroke case respective clouds many represent collection features medical diagnoses may relevant case unlike textbook features represent lot varied information including actual events nonverbal information like clinicians past history diagnosing strokes caring people strokes cloud contain hundreds tens thousands features features unique aspects clinician conscious state way control variability clinicians assure physicians speciality similar exposure experiences training even ideal situation specialists identical exposure illness variability based different levels ability capacities example would medicine resident i worked whose examination heart stethoscope predicted echocardiogram results became kind joke team time hold stethoscope air patient room good ultrasound basic idea pattern matching clinician immediately recognizes one features know allows rapid diagnosis plan based feature looking works hypothetical case look features map purpose discussion consider patient year old woman year history known bipolar disorder known psychiatrist years one day husband calls concern patient seems developed problem communication seems talking usual voice ca comprehend saying appear manic depressed psychiatrist listens patient phone concludes fluent aphasia recommends take emergency department soon possible ongoing care requires psychiatrist talk emergency department physician hospitalist make sure acute stroke high differential diagnosis eventually go hospital examine patient confirm diagnosis practically cases psychiatric diagnosis require measure pattern matching process varying degrees medical acuity i would go far suggest important aspect diagnosis keep mind pattern matching also applies purely psychiatric part diagram despite recent criticism focus dsm elaboration pattern matching leads several important conclusions psychiatric diagnosis much dynamic process rote learning diagnostic manual average clinician many features diagnoses listed manual psychiatric diagnosis requires medical training way psychiatrist example could made diagnosis aphasia remain involved diagnostic process conclusion without medical training previous exposures scenarios training implications scenarios often made explicit every medical student resident practicing physician needs exposed diverse population patients problems area expertise order develop pattern matching capability also benefit asking attending clinicians made rapid diagnoses level training question obvious removing physicians capabilities diagnostic loop reduces capability loop best example i continue think primary care process diagnosis ongoing treatment depression anxiety depends results checklist patient completes less minutes assumes entity called depression based purely verbal description pattern matching required actually assumes population people affliction despite hype measurement based care i think single person like exists pattern matching blurs line objective subjective often much confusion line objective criteria written manual somewhere captures even basic essence diagnosing stroke patient bipolar disorder objective checklist somewhere capture problem obviously reason people tend equate subjective bad unscientific example given similar example subjective state experience diagnosing strokes probably best diagnostician subjective objective rating scale stand chance consider pattern matching important unspoken part diagnostic process obvious reasons important diagnostic criteria manual obvious reasons really practice medicine without george dawson md dfapa clark microcognition london bradford book
