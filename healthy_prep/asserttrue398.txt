i lot desktop science lately i happy report superb easy use online tools exist creating phylogenetic trees based gene similarities something non trivial implement day i speculated fruit fly ogg gene encodes enzyme designed repair oxidatively damaged guanine residues dna might derive archaea archaea case microbiologist comprise one three super kingdoms tree life basically life earth classified either archaeal eukaryotic eubacterial eubacteria true bacteria i think think bacteria think staphylococcus tetanus bacteria coli rest eukaryota higher life forms starting yeast fungi algae plankton progressing grass corn pine trees worms rabbits donkeys way highest life form stephen colbert little joke eukaryotes big complex cells distinct nucleus complex organelles like mitochondria chloroplasts huge amount dna packaged pairs chromosomes archaea look lot like bacteria tiny lack distinct nucleus organelles etc fact considered bacteria recently around turn st century carl woese george fox provided persuasive evidence members group organisms different genetic profile mention lifestyle deserved taxonomic domain thus recognize certain bacteria like creatures archaea technical considerations behind distinction bacteria archeons rather deep codon usage patterns ribosomal rna structure cell wall details lipid metabolism esoterica one distinguishing feature archeons easy understand willingness live harsh conditions archaeal species tend call extremophiles usually always take residence places incredibly salty incredibly hot incredibly alkaline acidic generally agreed eukaryotes arose archaea bacteria appeared means clear whether archaea bacteria branched independently common ancestor perhaps one arose popular theory right archaea arose gram positive bacteria sought refuge inhospitable habitats escape chemical warfare tactics gram positives complication makes studying sort thing harder fact horizontal gene transfer known happen surprising frequency actually across domains possible study phylogenetic relationships desktop course one way obtain dna sequences given gene produced variety organisms feed gene sequences tool like tree making tool phylogeny fr voila instant phylogeny ogg gene interesting case although dna repair enzyme encoded gene occurs wide variety higher life forms plus archaea widespread among bacteria aside couple spirochaetes one bacteroides species bacteria particular gene members class clostridia strict anaerobes question clostridia get gene anaerobic archaea using excellent online cogeblast tool i able build list organisms ogg obtain relevant gene sequences literally mouse clicks run search using cogeblast check checkboxes next organisms results list select phylogenetics dropdown menu bottom results list see screenshot click go button new fastaview window open containing gene sequences items whose checkboxes checked cogeblast bottom fastaview window small box looks like click phylogeny fr button red arrow immediately sequences sent french server converted phylogenetic tree matter one two minutes usually result tree looks something like i color coded tree make results easier interpret creating tree kind without potential pitfalls one thing dna sequences vastly unequal lengths groupings made phylogeny fr likely reflect gene lengths true phylogeny tree i various data checks make sure comparing apples apples even sanity check order groupings make sense actually top diagram color coded green find eukaryotes grouped together fruit fly drosophila yeast saccharomyces fungus aspergillus bottom diagram clostridium species purplish red fall subtree next tiny subtree methoanobrevibacter actually makes good deal sense two methanobrevibacter species shown inhabitants feces nearby clostridium bartletti diff fact salt loving archaea members group together organisms names starting 'h also indicative sound grouping overall tree looks sound wondering numbers scale bar bottom shows approximate percentage difference dna sequences associated particular length tree depth red numbers tree branches indicative probability immediately underlying nodes related probably important thing know evolutionary distance two leaves tree proportional sums branch lengths connecting branch lengths explicitly specified eyeball top diagram see branch lengths two drosophila instances short means closely related contrast branch lengths saccharomyces ancestor drosophila long meaning organisms distantly related give idea relatedness i checked botulinum ogg protein amino acid sequence tetani found identity amino acids i compared botulinum enzyme difficile identity drosophila identity even applies coverage area versus tetani diff bottom line blast wise relatedness appear correspond sound fashion tree wise relatedness two things stand one clostridium species group together small cluster clostridia near salt lovers main branch near methane producing archaea group clostridia near salt lovers happen chromosomal content makes quite different rest clositridia whose thing stands appear clostridial ogg could archaeal origin based relationship methanoplanus methanobrevibacter main group clostridia also leptum group ogg may share ancestor halophilic archaea one thing say sure ogg ancient tempting speculate eukaryotes obtained ogg early mitochondria early mitochondria actually archaeal endosymbionts first part easily true know early mitochondria quickly exported dna host nucleus today mitochondrial dna vestigial well mitochondrial genes actually host nucleus things like mitochondrial dna polymerase transcribed nucleus generated rna whether early mitochondria archaeal endosymbionts one knows anyway i hope shows easy generate phylogenetic trees comfort living room sofa using nothing laptop wireless internet connection try making phylo trees using cogeblast phylogeny fr let me know find
