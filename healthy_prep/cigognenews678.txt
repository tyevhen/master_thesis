know someone chronically cold feet hands extremities forever cold think nature nurture cold hands feet went certain kind personality got start months conception moreover suppose could change tendencies well tall order need explanation general philosophy normal born normal adapt normally deviation leading changed anatomy physiology early life means something went wrong normal serious illness emotional problems birth something go wrong time i shall address problem try explore go wrong produces radical deviations first years lives following information taken part work singer germany one constants i see practice reliving oxygen deprivation birth hypoxia depleted oxygen anoxia reduced turns literature filled studies indicate majority babies born limited oxygen often due painkillers anesthetics reduce oxygen input baby adapt situation many ways one revert animal diving reflex redistributes oxygen needed namely key vital organs lungs heart deprives extremities oxygen set tendency cold hands feet moment plus two days life plus years reshaping personality time also last eighty years reduced oxygen forget smoking mother one takes suppressive tranquilizers also happens mother takes serious pain killers tranquilizers pregnancy involved long terms adaptation syndrome body needs slow metabolism fast uses nutrients lifetime adaptation i called parasympathetic one structure brain called hypothalamus controls many hormone secretions also controls two different nervous systems sympathetic managing aggressive active tendencies parasympathetic managing reposeful healing ones trauma low oxygen birth produce dominant parasympathetic predilection encompasses many biologic parameters also psychological ones well short makings phlegmatic passive unassuming held back personality someone always reacting imprint low oxygen input thus everything becomes problem everything much tendency give easily prolonged continued aggressive assertive response shallow slow breathers cold extremities reluctant personality self starter think change individuals remember ensemble biologic psychological responses involved survival strategies things picked random simply convenient reconfiguring oxygen reduction response one key way prevent oxygen damage brain system sends oxygen heart lungs feet also means less possible damage heart trauma affects heart may show fifty years first heart attack course one way avoid provide sufficient oxygen birth failing fetus newborn reduce oxygen demands mean inadequate cerebral oxygen supplies lower cerebral metabolism rate later mean learning problems know say got cold feet true person reacting based fear terror fear accompanying oxygen lack early i written musings book unexpected may early oxygen deprivation involved later alzheimer disease brain constant adaptation imprinted reduced brain oxygen brain saying i lacking supplies originally adapted lack various ways including change amount strength certain synapses gaps nerve cells filled chemicals either enhance slow neuronal message one cell brief earlier adaptation becomes permanent almost immutable underlies much deep depression i seen constant hopelessness helplessness accompany personality see book janov solution elaborate discussion course drop core body temperature patients get close deep early feelings womb life birth temperature fall three degrees minutes relived patients deeply depressed come session degree reading parasympath generally one two degree lower reading sympath seems permanent dive state polar bear ready oxygen reduction point reduced oxygen needs whole personality seems shrivel constricting one rather expansive speaks takes much less space air words hardly move mouth air fatigue wonder less sexual whole system slows adapt reduced oxygen system best avoid mismatch supply demand see singer neonatal tolerance hypoxia comp biochem physiology part pages imprinted low oxygen might expect slower growth rate one way see neonates born smoking mothers often smaller stature assumes trauma somewhere womb life maturation foretell premature heart attack cancer later life i think likely lead cancer cardiac problems massive repression inhibition goes along kind personality repression womb life events nearly always life death matters repression engenders massive result may serious distortion cellular level thus scheme heart disease expression sympath cancer repression clearly hard fast rule something think many factors play role exclude whole childhood filled experiences many later effects womb life trauma namely diabetes hypertension high blood pressure shown pregnant woman given steroids stress hormones offspring tends suffer high blood pressure seckl meaney glucorticoid programming ptsd risk annals academy science particular babies born mothers show hypertension tendencies birth note strong link stress hormone intake mother animal baby long term hypertension sheep seems like later pregnancy occurs permanent adult high blood pressure sensory window stimulus apt create alterations functioning reason important anxious mother delivering stress hormones baby fetus baby said born tendency anxiety well one way know mothers anxious seem raise cortisol levels amniotic fluid surrounding fetus may seem like heredity getting known high levels stress hormones carrying mother implicated later diabetes immune disease allergies hypertension others much stronger correlation mother stress level later dementia important stress mother fetus compromises repressive system later difficult hold surging feelings importance low level imprints suppressed person difficulty concentrating focusing attention deficit disorder key element repressive system prefrontal cortex pressed service counteract feelings march awareness hence overt anxiety states begin understand bit later drug addiction always seems like mystery slowly becoming aware pain installed fetal system born still needs quelling generally high valence witness patients reliving early trauma logical one uses pain killers later direct focus earlier shall never solve human problems university california irvine important research gary lynch well known neurobiologist found early trauma later likelihood memory problems years years suppressing feelings seems caving externally oriented prefrontal area neurons constant pressure imprint begin die one reason early stress memory structure brain hippocampus tends diminish size mice hippocampus surgically tampered much excitable prone anxiety states adapt well short one personal history one neuro biologic memory significant factor happens one brain
