seen either directly window night perspective seeing room illuminated two three lighting sources night reading informational displays next art i learned may riding l train new york city late night peering offices people still working paintings natural night time occurrences like famous painting diner night called nighthawks paintings displayed exhibit annotated drawings clear attention light sources light paintings office night example notation light coming night window overhead office light lighted adjacent room nighthawks always interested me terms form attention lighting details interests me even reading kandel book art viewer brings viewing situation i suppose lot people seeing diner night insomniac night entirely different proposition many insomniacs dread night equate sleep many see exciting part day like different world perceptions much clearer i actually cataloged nighttime experiences remain vivid today decades ago example i remember one night i wide awake pm decided i probably going sleep night better time go chemistry lab i working time continue experiments i working degrees three mile walk two inches snow fallen crunched squeaked every time i took step i past old decrepit sandstone block hotel half way point snow started come across street large white marble bank building flashing time temperature least four lighting sources flashing time temperature street lights light coming shops rooms hotel light reflecting fresh snow i walked three miles unusual lighting circumstances hearing feeling crunching squeaking boots entire way thoroughly invigorating i reached lab experiments sun came i found couch building fell asleep may sound like much someone used sleeping night i bring viewing hopper painting diner night i find myself excited probably effect others i could easily walk diner night talk fellow insomniacs would fairly good mood also reminded me kandel recent book age insight focus beholder experience main idea viewer experience critical completion work art idea originated alois reigl art historian developed formal method analyzing works art corollary new generation artists implicit task educating public new ways view art kandel focus viennese modernist painters klimt kokoschba schiele role educating public unconscious instinctual urges paintings time psychoanalysis developed theory viewer experience also looked issues inner external coherence case inner coherence painting clear narrative require viewer complete story case less clear narratives viewer may respond physical emotional space painting social equality people painting emotional empathic equality people painting according kandel ambiguity image elicits conscious unconscious process recognition viewer responds emotionally empathically image terms life experiences struggles critical rarely recognized aspect art i college time point recall classes either specifically art classes liberal arts courses interpretation art discussed response viewer necessary complete art even though idea years considerations also highlight artistic aspects media like photography many common criticisms photography art many consider creative process truncated picture anybody consider predictable way elicit emotional response humane society save children commercials broadcast late night television photography lot example i posted sequence pictures sisters span years years facebook feed i found pictures especially sequence emotionally stunning i wanted see friends photographers thought surprise i got two responses wow cool friends seem particularly interested photography least based post facebook case narrative implicit partial sisters age body language facial expressions seem change time i think would difficult average viewer respond emotionally empathically construct theory mind interpretation going photography clearly compelling painting forms visual art neuroscientist kandel wealth information neurobiology beholder experience chapter focused issue talks unconscious determinants beauty attractiveness discusses activation reward system level ventral tegmental area orbitofrontal cortex ofc response attractive faces especially smiling faces beautiful images points one experiment showed beautiful pictures activate ofc motor cortex ugly pictures opposite suggesting seeing ugly fearful faces sets brain prepare fleeing response kandel approach discussion artist beholder necessary relationship complete art underlying neuroscience makes lot sense me compelling aspect story apart loving art idea look problem perspective neuroscience get carried away kandel comfortable discussing neuroscience qualitative subjective aspects creation perception art one necessarily explain point psychiatry subjective became dirty word illusion created extreme unique brains measured characterized simple collection symptoms student consciousness knows absurd think billion unique people unique brains broken relatively disorders personalities executive functions iqs however else might want approximate neurobiology art beholders experience great example i good idea i like hopper work theory mind fellow insomniac mind insomniac i speculation work especially people included i hold another thing i learned years people necessarily interested one anothers interpretations art favorite art art i collect pure abstract art
