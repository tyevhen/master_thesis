recently i wrote dangers hallucinogens one long lasting well known lsd lysergic acid diethylamide let go examine drugs i noted previously chemical brains serotonin fights pain blocking effects serotonin gets depleted internecine battle pain time imprinted begin suffer bolstering chemicals empty usually without great load pain internal pain blocking system manufacture feel better many compounded experiences agony carrying mother chronically anxious drinker become great deficit go doctor writes prescription know chemical depleted birth gestation know works level pain engendered trauma early life mediated part brainstem great takes powerful drugs shut enter serotonin makes dainty step neural armamentaria fight good fight sometimes enough double often add tranquilizers soon become addicted soon grow addicted soon grow smart enough know battle forever losing one fight right battle earth inside fight imprinted pain adversary pain blockers another name blockers oh yes prozac plus dozens others lsd attaches serotonin receptors soften mollify effects effect pushes activating part hallucinogen controls egress keeps feeling yes repression blocks feeling naturally great early suffering even birth see cemented faces portray lack feeling know pain way see faces hallucinogens block feelings i written blocking gates pain deficit blocking action produces i call leaky gates leaky gates help produce addiction allow ineffable lower level pain escape total capture imagine drugs blow gates wide open see indescribable agony sometimes see pain see pain te top ideational level producing bizarres ideas beliefs god way measure pain several theories exist drugs actually brain body attaching cells called receptors interacting cellular enzyme systems affecting chemical properties outer cell membranes goldenberg pages many drugs believed combine chemical groups within cell cell wall drugs combine specific agents known receptors theory receptors actually attract drug molecular shape fits drug sometimes known lock key theory think shape key fit certain lock correct shaped key lock matched lock opened receptor theory much certain shaped drug molecule attracted receptor site cell wall two shapes fit line together drug acts way natural body chemical set chain events key drugs mimic body done loved infants even let me repeat tranquilizers somehow mimic produce naturally example naturally occurring body chemical acetylcholine combines receptors membranes muscle nerve cells chemically specialized receive certain synthetic drug agents duplicate action acetylcholine combining cell wall drugs sometimes referred agonists boost action cell antagonist case atropine competes receptor site normally accepts acetylcholine says get way i take place moment block dislocate normal physiological function dislocate energy tendency still exist must diverted somewhere noses around finding another vulnerable place person acts overeating made calm drugs suffers

birth timetable needs form critical window must fulfilled past window needs fulfilled symbolically feeling unloved eradicated adulthood love primal pain blocks entry one way rid feeling anxious agitated slow stop transmission messages neurons nerve cells message pain stimulates reach higher levels feel calm even though grand tumult going lower brain centers never change pain appreciation take tranquilizers pain killers feel good damage still going matter think think feel unreal state cognitive insight therapy change way patients think feel way really feel change way really feel means pain pain addiction need drug calming aim therapy must establish fluid lines communication among levels consciousness communication given positive experiences conception noxious stimuli pain intrudes gating intercedes blocks information levels communication halted misdirected one level know going levels true meaning holistic levels speak common language contribute share single feeling make patient whole desired goal long know means brain grosso modo overall scheme goal efforts human means feeling inordinate noxious input early provokes repression blocks aspect feeling fully feeling beings blocked aspect massive gating sealed away major portions brain function access thus level consciousness able contribute share experience means able feel great joy well sadness means sympathize empathize depressive tells getting anything life interests joy know carrying load repression repression underpinning depression wrong taking tranquilizers pain killers primary job gate emotional pain keeps feelings unconscious result cortex signal emergency thus keeping reactivity within bounds key pain killers reactivity blunted order save system massive reactivity occasionally reactivity reactivity enormous threaten one life see therapy defenses dismantled vital signs mounting danger area feelings responding realistically unknown hidden force acknowledge force helpless measure lower brain activity understand immediately tumult going decks never dreamed existed ship sinking water decks carry nothing happening many called soft drugs ultimately killers quelling deeper centers drugs eases called thought disorders patients ease defenses session great pain begins march prefrontal areas thinking centers cortex ruminate danger actually lock feeling short anxiety attack system tries stave approaching pain great terror pressing cortical centers creates paroxysms obsessive thoughts space me i stuck one helping often birth statements actual feeling well buried person left vague anxiety manufacture things afraid rationale hierarchy nervous system comparative force imprints different levels diminishes move scale evolution thus something happens two months alter brain structure permanently whereas trauma lack touch happens age ten produce serious brain impairment clearly timetable imprints depending critical period characterizes critical period irreversibility cortex diminished going flower adulthood brain scans bear less activity prefrontal area certain impulse states attention deficit disorder research hyperactive patients seen elevated cortisol stress hormone levels research salivary cortisol st bartholomew hospital london reliving early trauma including birth trauma normalization cortisol levels dampening pain longer necessary pain gone shorn original power memory based research find explanation chronically high cortisol levels imprint also normalized brain system better balanced right left hemispheres one piece part organic whole thus isolate one factor serotonin another factor time drugs make definitive statements addiction attack one aspect lack serotonin level achieve goals need attack central organizing principle rest take care brain longer considered isolated organ encased cranium must considered part entire physiologic system thus body distress distress found brain hormones blood system hypothesis drug addiction made largely early pain i lack love pain sets motion countervailing forces namely repression repression place faulty failing serotonin endorphin systems inadequate task suffering need outside help form drugs dampen suffering often outside drugs utilized mimic exact biochemicals produce internally makes addicting drugs normalizing system need go lengths get even risking jail strength internal imprinted pain often measured opposing forces repressive system dialectic pain provokes opposite turns feelings numbness person feels like bubble reach real life grey dull price pay tranquilizers feeling pain equals life
