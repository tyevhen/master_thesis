post inspired post neuroskeptic impression i get blog average reader thinks psychiatrists bunch chuckleheads know little probably ignorant science neuroskeptic seems slighlty tolerant like bloggers stir pot focus post take look kappa statistics given article freedman dsm field trials graphic supplied boringoldman blog conclude dsm reliabilities good good dsm iv thankfully psychiatrists could ignore dsm wanted face seems like damning criticism defense neuroscientific opinion turns comes two sources first common experience people medical diagnosis lifetime ever misdiagnosed ever get second opinion find diagnoses doctors far apart difficult make plan address problem i give one many examples lifetime i second year medical student i several incidents ankle pain i assessed ended orthopedics clinic i ankle casted couple times even though i history trauma i finally woke one night excruciating left ankle pain went emergency department i saw orthopedics aspirated joint also asked wife leave asked me i possibly contracted gonorrhea somewhere i given acetaminophen codeine discharged hours couple weeks pain i finally got see one top experts rheumatology finally made diagnosis gout point i seen doctors none able correctly diagnose cause ankle pain calculating kappa statistic comparison expert previous physicians would resulted low number story end anyone gout knows varied presentations including inflammation often seems extend outside joint residency training years later i acute right wrist pain internist i saw decided needed aspirate wrist joint ended aspirating piece wrist joint syringe diagnosis despite procedure i demanded treatment gout course worked several recurrences wrist pain resulted misdiagnoses cellulitis keep mind i testing doctors i presenting telling i gout i think wrist pain acute gout attack saying well gout usually affect wrist i think cellulitis i walked clinics thrown prescription antibiotic away i walked door i finally got supply anti inflammatory medication i need treat episodes myself rather risk misdiagnosis physician know much gout could say anecdotal i anecdotes i personally misdiagnosed anecdotes additional thousand people time i heard ben stein say point anecdotal becomes statistical good example medicine literature say reliability diagnoses diagnostic criteria gout around longer dsm another frequent criticism psychiatric diagnosis confirmatory tests diagnosis numerous confirmatory tests gout prevent misdiagnosis case brings second line defense kappa values documented medical literature let me preface saying compared psychiatry
