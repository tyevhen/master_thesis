i feel press release nih important enough show entirety type activity fast track potential treatment make available public much quicker normal process let cross fingers folks nih researchers create comprehensive collection approved drugs identify new therapies rare neglected diseases researchers begun screening first definitive collection thousands approved drugs clinical use rare neglected diseases hunting additional uses drugs hoping find label therapies rare diseases afflict million americans effort coordinated national institutes health chemical genomics center ncgc critical step explore full potential drugs new applications said nih director francis collins ph hope process may identify potential new treatments rare neglected diseases researchers assembled collection approved drugs screening based information ncgc pharmaceutical collection browser tripod nih gov npc publicly available web based application described paper appearing april issue science translational medicine provides complete information nearly active pharmaceutical ingredients including small molecule drugs approved regulatory agencies united states canada europe japan well compounds registered human clinical trials order launch systematic repurposing effort using ncgc drug screening technologies needed access comprehensive collection clinically approved drugs said christopher p austin director ncgc currently administered national human genome research institute nhgri team took monumental task assembling collection making publicly available creating world class resource ncgc pharmaceutical collection npc browser provides users ability explore drugs name chemical structure approval status indication groups interested developing screening collections leverage supplier catalog information provided browser browser ongoing effort also includes entries investigational drugs ultimate goal collect compounds tested man present potential jump start development treatments rare neglected diseases current focus collaborating disease foundations industry academic investigators disease relevant assays screen approved drug collection acquired ncgc new therapeutic use approved drug would require additional studies including clinical trials disease approved food drug administration given cost limited quantities drugs collection partnership screen npc evaluated based quality disease related assay scientific merit creating new drug expensive recouping investment difficult rare diseases due small number patients disease case tropical neglected diseases limited ability patients pay treatments today therapies available less rare diseases drugs receive regulatory approval demonstrated reasonably safe effective treatment specific disease condition drugs used large populations new benefits adverse effects discovered subsequently use approved drugs expanded beyond drug originally approved treat health conditions thalidomide example repurposing drug serious adverse effects one condition treat another disease according authors used sedative treatment morning sickness pregnancy later withdrawn found cause severe birth defects thalidomide repurposed use leprosy infectious disease causing skin lesions multiple myeloma cancer plasma cells type white blood cell present bone marrow based drug new application food drug administration approved thalidomide treatment leprosy multiple myeloma patients recently team nhgri researchers used similar approach examining patient blood samples see gene protein networks active syndrome called periodic childhood fever associated aphthous stomatitis pharyngitis cervical adenitis pfapa pfapa causes monthly flare ups fever accompanied sore throat swollen glands mouth lesions researchers detected overactive genes patient immune response including interleukin molecule important triggering fever inflammation data researchers hypothesized anakinra drug prevents interleukin binding receptor could therapeutic injected anakinra five children second day pfapa fevers showed reduction fever inflammatory symptoms within hours another approach require complete knowledge disease drug mechanism uses high throughput drug screening technologies screen drugs biological activity cell based models disease drugs record activity known hits studied therapeutic potential researchers animal models disease eventually human clinical trials ncgc already screened approved drug collection cell based models disease every screen ncgc characterizes pharmacology compound wide range concentrations using signature quantitative high throughput screening approach data ncgc screens published made publicly available addition repurposing drugs ncgc plans screen collection part tox initiative better predict model adverse effects associated approved drugs drug toxicity one primary reasons approved drugs removed marketplace ability predict toxicity would dramatically improve efficiency drug development
