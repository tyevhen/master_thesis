corticosteroid cream went work night home rash seemed mildly improved still itched i decided get medical input point usual choices area emergency department urgent care recently health plan started offer online consultation combination limited diagnoses procedures algorithmic set questions ability upload images consultation nurse practitioner i looked list conditions set diagnose treat noted rash one logged health care still infancy nobody surprised took me much longer expected log appropriate interface first program suggested i could use existing login would also integrate previous test results conditions current evaluation needing call i established separate login password episode rather expected details front program started ask me usual questions rash screens including forced answer question think causing rash possible answers insect bite infection allergy exposure poison ivy etc nothing list seemed likely reason i calling i could proceed past point without giving answer i clicked insect bite completing screens text field i entered even though i answered insect bite question i i could proceed i provide answer next came expected demographic data i live town postal service never gets right i list zip code wrong town name pops software exception took me extra time enter reenter data already somewhere healthcare company database final screen billing financial data including credit card information data healthcare company know last five years point i minutes process time upload photos i photos ankle program accepted sign occurred minutes mark i waited return mail call i marvelled health care companies transferred clerical work physicians last years transferring patient i work intake person financial person clinic hospital minutes i got call nurse practitioner said although clear i rash rash could diagnose system i told i applying potent corticosteroid said keep go primary care clinic get checked primary care physician within minutes i got mail dear george thanks taking time talk phone health safety top priority based information shared think person visit best way handle specific condition please know charged visit today sorry could help time please keep mind next time feeling ill thanks choosing good know i guess diagnosis specific treatment plan i continued corticosteroid next night work i stopped urgent care clinic work i saw family medicine physician inspected palpated rash took pulses determined good area asked me clusters questions clearly designed rule various pathological processes conclusion well infection due trauma clearly inflammatory process like atopic dermatitis point i would keep applying corticosteroid asked me questions mind preoccupied tales devastating spider bites lately i blurted way look like brown recluse spider bite laughed said absolutely i learned lessons apply psychiatry first appears human diagnosticians safe keep mind system set diagnose treat restricted list conditions considered least complicated medicine second human diagnostician superior capabilities depend pattern matching turn depends experience reminded me course i taught years avoid diagnostic errors pattern matching big part two examples rashes diabetic retinopathy dermatologists much faster much accurate classifying rashes pictures family physicians ophthalmologists much accurate using indirect ophthalmoscopy family physicians using direct ophthalmoscopy diagnosing diabetic proliferative retinopathy fact family physicians slightly better chance lessons psychiatry two fold remember idea restricted list conditions considered complex turns depression anxiety list even though call center call complete paperwork like i would probably much stretch say many primary care clinic diagnoses depression anxiety keyed rating scale like studies dermatologists ophthalmologists expert pattern matchers looking patient result diagnosis essentially dialed second aspect design algorithm implications rash algorithm forced choice paradigm i could proceed end unless i picked answer clearly wrong way set problem called measurement based care appearance quantitative result joint commission called point pain scale quantitative year pain treatment initiative year i spent good deal adult life talking patients moods sleep appetite patterns symptoms important part job coming plausible scenario current distress i say without doubt half people i see describe discrete episodes mania depression usual description depression i get life long remissions certain personality characteristics predict descriptions symptom severity initial interview people completely minimize symptoms people flat tell me want discuss inner thoughts even experiencing thoughts may place danger map response patterns onto psychiatrist hopefully result diagnostic formulation plan deal nuances map response patterns onto phq suddenly number somebody believes meaning looking question thoughts would better dead hurting way suddenly people alarmed person personality disorder chronic suicidal thinking chronic obsessions involving suicidal thinking endorses nearly every day response falsely reassured patient significant personality change depression endorses forced make choice rather using information necessary make evaluation discipline moving direction using relevant information clinical situations less rash today example happen organ governed much less genetic metabolic signalling information human brain even situation diagnosis clear etiology diagnostic features present forcing choices reduces information flow rather facilitating primary care physicians find checklist approach diagnosing anxiety depression useful i would see problem might useful look medications used based phq kind impact approach medication utilization also might useful seminar two problem prescribing medications correlation overprescribing opioids use quantitative scale measure everyone pain undeniable question applies circumstances whether number subjective rating scale ever enough reason prescribe medication already know i say george dawson md dfapa
