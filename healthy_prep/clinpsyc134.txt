wake new england journal medicine study revealed sizable discrepancy raw data antidepressants data published medical journals people jumped defense drug companies post i examine arguments compare evidence extra feature drugwonks disconcerting love vioxx discussed toward end post nathan posts frequently excellent pharmalot blog made several comments one written scientific article publication i make aware things journals accept article written journal editors scrutinize submit reviewers scrutinize frequently rejecting articles conclusive poorly written scientists write scientific articles public relations representatives scientists generally waste weeks months time writing articles prove anything probably accepted journal negative result generally meaningless science think thomas edison wrote articles filaments failed light light bulb i ask surprise negative clinical trials written publications one example paxil trial may tried doses mg mg dose failed show effect mg dose show effect anyone waste time writing journal article explaining mg dose failed obvious drug levels high enough observe effect problems post well let face peer review exactly catch everything fact peer review often results publication poor studies like infamous paxil study actually appears nathan point studies conclusive poorly written get published saying positive studies ssris likely written better studies found negative results sure makes much sense perhaps implying negative study conclusive well neither positive study matter one considers small benefit antidepressants placebo even positive studies exactly yielded conclusive evidence anything particularly impressive nathan either naive point dishonest well known ghostwriters frequently used publication process problem helping poor writer piece together readable manuscript often huge problem one considers ghostwriters often huge conflict interest hired drug companies pen papers paint product favorable light negative result meaningless science amazing comment truly amazing trials conducted drug one turns positive i suppose everyone prescribe drug nine negative results meaningless yeah makes lot sense point dosing would make sense except irrelevant case hand remember nathan commenting specifically antidepressant studies get published hypothesizing authors study included doses approved effective perhaps missed page article states included data pertaining doses later approved safe effective data pertaining unapproved dosages excluded oh authors include data unapproved doses much critique reading study offering critiques good idea nathan another comment i understand appears smoking gun i state i believe let say i clinical trial paxil mg per day mg per day mg twice per day mg twice per day total trials mg dose works three trials counted negative evidence drug work course see critique holds water nathan bob pointed editors like accept articles make journal look good nejm probably going accept bunch articles clinical trials work mean editors sort table deal company simply means looking best interest journal public i think missing point course scientists like publish things work things fail point clinical trial data good bad ugly available public fda anyone else interested whether data makes journal irrelevant clinical trial data available public cue laugh track turn little little still ah go kidding absolutely thing repository clinical trial data part reason problem ghosted science exists first place clinical trial registries go ahead check clinicaltrials gov one outline study registry report results whatever manner one deems fit enter drugwonks would guessed dependable fair balanced drugwonks weighed well pieces robert goldberg post nejm medicine recycles old story many negative studies antidepressants published affect whether drugs work add distortion negative study negative time negative simply confirm hypothesis times poorly designed small studies little statistical power prove drugs fail difference taken together often help guide responds medicines need critical path suggest failure publish negative studies part coverup wrong leads fearmongering road journalists raising unfounded fears safety efficacy drugs leading people die stop taking medicines fearmongering media engaged regarding vaccines ssris avandia vioxx vytorin argument studies negative simply sample sizes small please read following article page difference sample sizes published studies median patients unpublished studies median patients neither large significant words goldberg analysis wrong i stated reading study offering critiques good idea time negative simply confirm hypothesis hell mean confirm hypothesis sort seemingly random statement i run across frequently drugwonks site negative studies poorly designed positive studies thus designed better seems wrong well studies particularly complex one group gets drug gets placebo participants assigned groups randomly theory participants unaware receiving drug placebo appears large differences studies designed case goldberg provides one single shred evidence support claims nathan mentioned also provided evidence support critiques nejm study bring vioxx love goldberg goes new level wrote part journalists raising unfounded fears safety efficacy drugs leading people die stop taking medicines fearmongering media engaged regarding vaccines ssris avandia vioxx vytorin let focus one medicines vioxx i mention i type i quaking rage goldberg either incredibly ignorant incredibly dishonest person claims expertise matters drugs know much better claiming people died stopped taking vioxx apparently serious lord jesus tell me man joking first many people died switched one minor painkiller another bob please provide data please rage coming bob since drug wonk would imply least firm understanding important highly publicized findings medical literature many people died take vioxx according study david graham colleagues published lancet using relative risks abovementioned randomised clinical trials background rates seen nsaid risk studies estimated excess cases serious coronary heart disease probably occurred usa market life rofecoxib even third people died well math taking drug market resulted people dying kidding me graham fearmonger one favorite epithets thrown around drugwonks site take word researchers found one meta analysis found increased risk heart attacks cox inhibitors relative placebo drugs another meta analysis also found elevated heart attack risk vioxx meta analysis found increased risk cardiovascular renal events vioxx another meta analysis found cardiovascular events related vioxx use bob evidence vioxx clear bob i differ number points i think reasonable people disagree many items vioxx one drug clearly repeatedly linked serious health problems bob defending calling criticize fearmongers nice game plan reasonable critique last psychiatrist offers reasonable analysis suggesting academic authors want publish negative studies publishing negative studies would make look incompetent mainstream culture medicine would ask runs trial finds negative results even studies submitted journal likely rejected peer reviewers editors may true extent i tend believe negative studies would published always journal editors ability think critically publish material runs counter mainstream medicine sure studies would rejected time two i think would published point i think analysis intelligent thankfully involve term fearmonger i think offers partial explanation missing boat i could certainly missed something i even seen lame attempt critique part study quite damning remember study found drug companies changed primary outcome measures statistical analyses submitting fda submitting journal publication resulted inflated effect sizes every antidepressant kind big deal medical literature ends suggesting drugs beneficial actually even drugwonks mentioned rather major point oh one thing bob goldberg engaging variety tactics border slander regarding roy poses health care renewal recent often nonsensical post i wo honor linking might want improve credibility missed
