inpatient units major difference primary diagnoses listed would likely admitted like somatoform disorder personality disorder primary diagnosis study says little admission criteria american inpatients psychiatric units pure substance use disorders actively discriminated insurers government agencies govern hospitalizations german sample constitute primary diagnoses authors statistical comparison locked ward open ward groups across outcome variables two logical flaws study researchers comment one first generalizability data authors seem recognize use oecd data rates psychiatric bed utilization germany per population versus uk per per suggesting greater acuity populations fewer beds greater proportion acutely ill patients parameter critical american inpatient psychiatry number aggressive
