thing i find odd psychology particularly psychotherapy little attention paid process crying despite fact homo sapiens animal possesses function part treated though important i disagree furthermore i believe crucial function sets apart animals essential truly complex rational thinking perhaps speech opens resonation affectively connecting similar feelings certainly responsible capacity metaphor speak metaphorically crying keeps computer brain crashing thing effectively reboot damn thing also probably responsible capacity lie anything function odd semi convulsive behavior accompanied runny nose profuse tearing makes sense me something elaborate complex temporarily disabling normal function could extremely important i know ongoing neurological studies crying little known far i know going brain cry one little book pp i know made modest effort direction crying mystery tears william frey book written several years affective neuroscience revolution limited chemistry tears i seen fmri studies crying tiny spark interest always focused babies crying adults warmonger society militated crying sees weakness today i received notice amazon book preeminent neuroscientist v ramachandran titled tell tale brain neuroscientist quest makes human i search book found one single reference crying i antonio damasio book self comes mind constructing conscious brain used word twice passing epitome repression work years primal therapy along perusal recent work dr arthur janov relationship methylation imprint permanent reaction trauma stored brain process methylation controls aspects person behavior even physiology art recent paper depression points gaggle studies confirm canadian studies meaney szyf offer plethora info one study included art references i recently read focusing oxytocin receptors brain derived neurotrophic factor dynamic changes dna methylation stress associated genes oxtr bdnf acute psychosocial stress unternaehrer et al transl psychiatry aug doi tp i concluded crying mechanism demethylation even face cbt headfreaks still trying hijack science books like genie genes dawson church implies change beliefs change epigenome little practice way mental health i think leave i also think great discovery arthur janov cry subsequently love foundation primal therapy janov demonstrated past half century old crying works primal therapy insane asylums full people cry constantly never get better crying occurs haphazardly many psychotherapies results come show consistent replicable effectiveness case primal therapy deep behavioral mental affective physiological changes regularly observed interestingly enough first question clinical director asks therapists sessions patient feel exception expressions anger usually defense crying question easily translatable patient cry patient starts cry session way course beginning therapist concerned helping patient maintain focus deepening level feeling way tell feeling deepening listen feel quality crying patient experiencing ideally patient starts call rd line crying present going adult life feeling resonate childhood trauma patient drop nd line many patients difficult frequently claim memories childhood accessible soon persist resonation eventually rule day memories bubble forth memories excruciating become fully manifest deepen roll back time character crying changes somehow match age patient time trauma crying ceases feelings become physical patient body takes starts writhe waves dolphin like patterns feelings usually crushing suffocating grinding terror apex felt seconds time patient body knows long last run course day juncture patient relax slowly come back present right back chain pain nd line rd along trail flood insights connections occur patient discusses therapist occur patient usually feel though whole life connected patient world whole new way attitudes likes dislikes goals begin change patient start becoming really without destructive defensive methylation patterns learned survival quite simply needed anymore course ideal happen patients subject another occasion said i say persistence eventually win defense system systematic consistent therapy mechanism causes change patients power awareness biological patient whole physiology affected drives changes experienced i say crying demethylation process begs questions cry therapy get well many babies cry lot end even neurotic part primal session st line crying occurs people asylums continually crying get well partly questions attempts answering led me hypothesis crying works body natural demethylation process first i think crying demethylating occurs permanent come world gestation birth damaging crying natural process keep permanent imprinting occurring usually undo pathological methylation imprints occurred child raised loving minimally traumatizing environment cry function interfered child natural demethylation process crying undo effects trauma preventing imprinting subsequently neurosis unfortunately virtually societies extant cry function drastically interfered point many totally lose capacity cry live perverted cry function inappropriate actual needs person words repression rules day preventing trauma properly integrated large part cry function repressed damaged men many societies crying anathema every effort used prevent stop crying i still shudder i remember john f kennedy funeral impressed widow remained strong shed tear funeral procession went later people lives may enter psychotherapy somehow else even personal tragedy regain capacity cry unfortunately patients idea use function years accumulated much trauma systems overloaded crying haphazard without focus pain intensity going way back womb directions person easily count defense system goes interrupt natural function tears renewed repression way body knows protect assault reacting undergoing new perhaps original trauma obviously demethylation might occur crying episode counteracted aborted i might add also natural process crises defenses kick suspend feeling example ever near car crash notice react though automatic crisis passed might pull side road shudder cry laugh settle pathology occurs pull side road stay defended primal therapy address problem course first job help patients gain access feelings let select particular feeling thing lot feeling repressed expressed help focus specifically usually first thing comes session almost always shown within first minutes becomes leitmotif session words initiating organized process demethylation occur orderly way along natural route methylation occurred certain types trauma likely initiate specific pattern methylation body aids resonation takes art calls chain pain precise therapy current trauma traced back prototypic origin found usually occurred capacity cry i think hits point another process occurs i know exactly i possess even meager training biochemistry affective neuroscience i pretty good idea something methlytransferase involved maintenance methylation allows dna replicate without losing methylation pattern words i think birth primal fixes holds place demethylation occurred occur chain pain followed precisely particular pattern eliminated i think natural process people always moved toward present psychologically chaotic society move towards symbolically see news time reference system justice usually called closure usually euphemism revenge need real need resolve trauma suffer get lives destructive effects thanks janov learning separates animals taught cry however i also think focus research i would like see truly profound investigation crying determine exactly going brains rest bodies process i think focus offers comprehensive approach investigation primal therapy naturally extends affects study connected i mentioned research done vulnerable misinterpretation hijack headfreaks even cortisol studies art england routinely attacked dismissed headfreaks i also think biggest defense real psychotherapy ingrained fear prejudice crying long place psychotherapists continually turn therapies without
