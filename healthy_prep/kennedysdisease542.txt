mda announced today awarded research grant dr la spada study happens process autophagy kennedy disease following two articles found mda website spinal bulbar muscular atrophy sbma two studies university california san diego examine important role protein recycling sbma cells rely process called autophagy awe tof uh gee break recycle large proteins subcellular structures autophagy critical cell health relatively little known process motor neurons muscle controlling nerve cells affected sbma diseases including als sma sbma proteins misfold accumulate motor neurons autophagy take care accumulated proteins cause problems process appears disrupted sbma goal projects learn regulators autophagy motor neurons regulation goes awry sbma insights studies likely benefit work als misfolded proteins also accumulate additional information found sbma albert la spada ph muscles atrophy sbma target treatments ultimately rescue motor neurons spinal bulbar muscular atrophy sbma albert la spada professor cellular molecular medicine neurosciences pediatrics university california san diego awarded mda research grant totaling period three years study causes neurodegeneration loss nerve cells spinal bulbar muscular atrophy sbma sbma also known kennedy disease adult onset neuromuscular disorder affecting men caused mutation gene androgen receptor protein leads death motor neurons needed control muscle contraction la spada created mouse model neuronal cell culture models sbma use models investigate sbma causing mutation leads death motor neurons focusing changes metabolism impaired degradation worn defective proteins la spada lab test drugs target proposed regulatory factor also see whether blocking erroneous androgen receptor gene instructions compounds known antisense oligonucleotides beneficial previous work funded mda la spada lab shown directing therapies muscle cells rather directly nerve cells die sbma prevent disease mice exciting unexpected finding represents important step toward successful therapy development treatments target muscle instead nerve cells straightforward create easier test patients less likely cause serious side effects la spada says key finding also suggests similar strategy worth considering related motor neuron diseases spinal muscular atrophy sma amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als funding mda grant began august
