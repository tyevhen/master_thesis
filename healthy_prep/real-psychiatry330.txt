details grant history previous grants given press release broad institute details include fact broad institute scientists working genetics severe mental illnesses focus includes detailing genetic basis disorders complete elaboration pathways involved developing molecules modify pathways foundation effective medical treatment focus group severe psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia bipolar disorder autism attention deficit hyperactivity disorder also single largest donation psychiatric research ever search research grants past decade produce thousands research articles funded stanley foundation press release details fact grants stanley foundation incremental obviously monitored progress grantees satisfied progress made stopped critics suggesting money basically either wasted could better used symptom control would useful research symptom control goal question arguments basic psychiatric research much way i question arguments usually attack psychiatric practice clinical research speculation underlying premises cases similar basic arguments whether good idea fund basic science research applies psychiatry range speculation whether might useful fact urgent needs funding clinical side many arguments come idea symptom management versus scientific approach patient areas medicine purely scientific approach patient time clearcut examples would locating lesion somewhere body performing biopsy making tissue diagnosis example highly regarded test prove illness seems popular idea scientific medicine case science run several levels diagnosis depends correctly sampling lesion come skill sampler depends agreement pathologists making tissue diagnosis tissue diagnosis may irrelevant health patient treatments diagnosed illness many cases medicine treatment depends symptom recognition monitoring cases tests basic anatomy function good example asthma i previously posted see myth majority asthmatics inadequate control asthma approach asthma generally symptom control current basic science asthma depends identifying genes gene products allow specific treatment underlying pathophysiology surprising similarities mental illnesses example single asthma gene genetics various aspects asthma pathophysiology including degree treated assumed polygenic manner genetics severe psychiatric disorders difference larger portion human genome dedicated brain proteins personal correspondence experts puts figure high genome wide association studies severe asthma much difficulty identifying candidate genes reach statistical significance thought experiment comparing reference pathway asthma number similar pathways operative brain plasticity human consciousness variants call mental illnesses show surprising specific interventions asthma signaling signaling occurring brain even complex reason impressive brain function structural complexity cellular structural biochemical pathway levels yet rhetoric critics usually considers asthma disease legitimate psychiatric disorders lungs apparently considered legitimate target research funding brain critics saying allen frances md dsm critic decided neuroscience research may complicated million dollar grant may drop bucket sorting basic science suggests cruel paradox comes mental disorders chase receding holy grail future basic science breakthrough shamefully neglecting needs patients suffering right probably average worse patient severe mental illness years ago certainly much worse patient severe mental illness compared european countries experience psychiatry clearly much different dr frances although i probably least decade younger i remember time treatment child i heard stories great aunt working county sanatorium full patients tuberculosis severe mental illnesses state art treatment era psychopharmacology large numbers institutionalized patients went many never left unless mood disorder suddenly remitted received electroconvulsive therapy leaving often ended county poor farms indigent contrary dr frances observations years ago going back earlier i consider shorter definitive text describes describes like psychotic disorder asylum era many countries world concludes world without psychiatry rather tolerated indulged mentally ill treated savage lack feeling advent therapeutic asylum golden era idyllic refuge supposedly deviant values capitalism maintain otherwise fantasy p even psychopharmacology became available people institutions took long time make main street small town people i grew i witnessed generation people autism schizophrenia post traumatic stress disorder wwii korean war bipolar disorder treated amitriptyline benzodiazepines primary care physicians may home state hospitals treatment outcomes much better cruel paradox i find quite offensive blatant discrimination governments levels business proxies anyone country addiction mental illness i understand bluster diagnostic manual clearly made whit difference since released endless debates conflict interest apply handful physicians massive injustice exists clinical psychiatrists deal every day many times day i know refers post i say without doubt technology know alleviate significant degree suffering people chronic severe psychiatric disorders right reasonable cost cost hundred dollars takes see someone minute med check clinic visits year provide generic medications one year care cost amount middle aged person presenting emergency department chest pain reason care people chronic severe mental illness better countries financial incentives countries corporations make money denying care treatment mental illness addiction cruel paradox country neuroscience research occurring expense clinical care billion dollars directed clinical care country guess half would end hands insurance industry rather providing medical care image receding holy grail future basic science breakthrough certainly admirable rhetoric spent much time rearranging deck chairs dsm technology informed person thinks makes sense keep rearranging diagnostic criteria clinicians basically focus handful disorders informed clinician see basic disorders heterogenous conditions mapped onto unique conscious states basic premises couple possible outcomes continue pretending like past two decades everyone heterogeneous disorders treated way specific medication type psychotherapy alternative look specific subtypes based clinical criteria produce better treatments fewer side effects better outcomes since basic science research done hopes clinical breakthrough basic science research hypothesis testing service science science process criticism initially critiques terminology based psychiatry suggests vehicle expansion pharmaceutical industry suggesting research funds directed symptom control based crude definitions research internally inconsistent defies logic i unequivocally applaud past current efforts stanley foundation time mental health research clinical services subjected intensive rationing efforts inspiring private foundation comes forward face biases makes statement important area science one thing talk stigma quite another come treat basic neuroscience associated disorders seriously major health problem hopefully inspire others provide grants funding research development clinical neuroscience programs applied
