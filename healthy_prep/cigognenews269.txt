early epigenetics work pups born unloving mothers handed loving mothers born bad mothers reared loving mothers still seemed normal relatively unmethylated let remember methyl exists throughout system general amount rather much found specific genes weaver et al another reason research important found unloving mothers rodents causes methylation estrogen receptors female offspring offspring offspring deficient estrogen made less attentive loving babies yet know many key chemical processes affected lack early love idea many hormones changed neurotic mothers heavily methylated affects myriad adult behaviors depression inherited may precursors never manifested plenty love later childhood tendency methylation inherited epigenetically passed form basis depression seems research cited neurotic mothers methylated ineluctably forced unloving thus laying groundwork depression offspring later weaver et al hormones depleted scenario born tendency anxiety possibly imprint methyl much acetyl case acetylation faults repressive system acetylation recruiting acetyl pretty much produces opposite methylation tendency open rather close toward expression rather repression role acetylation inexact
