pharmacoepidemiology opioids united states depends fragmented approach i recently posted cdc study used commercial pharmacy database look characteristics opioid prescribing across individual counties united states past week i came across data brief office inspector general oig department health human services database million beneficiaries medicare part stated goals protect beneficiaries community prescription drug abuse prevent diversion illegal sales protect program fraud unnecessary expense methodology unique look prescription drug events pde opioids prescribed paid medicare part

opioid use disorders i used brand names hydrocodone oxycodone preparations people commonly report me typically requires investigation example percocet percs commonly refers higher dose oxycodone without acetaminophen single mg tablet oxycodone mme authors brief need concerned data discrepancies able get specific claims data terms outcome data looked prescriptions cost variables well looked total exposure one three medicare part beneficiaries received least one opioid prescription amounts million people beneficiary base million people total million hydrocodone acetaminophen prescriptions

metbolism necessary create slow metabolizer less likely experience analgesic effect addiction risk beneficiaries received high dose opioids med mg day indication noncancer chronic noncancer pain hospice patients cancer patients excluded common opioid prescribed high dose group oxycodone mg study also defined extreme amounts opioids med mg patients received amount patients receiving high extreme amounts med mg entire year concern high levels whether prescriptions indicated whether might diverted authors also suggested fraud could issue due stolen medicare identification number give example patient got opioid prescriptions one year family physician average daily med mg brief also estimates degree doctor shopping seeking prescriptions one physician pharmacy criteria used report prescribers pharmacies total beneficiaries met criteria also average daily med mg period three months also identified beneficiaries got opioid prescriptions different prescribers different prescribers time period even larger number prescribers pharmacies noted extreme cases number represents total number beneficiaries using opioids order magnitude previous estimate large commercial prescription database using estimates high dose opioids degree doctor shopping allowed estimate serious risk opioid overuse overdose number estimate category entire group taking opioids brief also looks issue prescribing opioids estimated prescribers wrote least one prescriptions total prescribers determined far outside norm one hundred ninety eight ordered opioids patients getting extreme amounts opioids med mg ordered opioids patients appeared doctor shopping ordered opioids patients members groups total number prescriptions written prescribers group opioid prescriptions prescribers ordered opioids beneficiaries receiving extreme amounts med mg prescribers questionable prescribing nurse practitioners physicians assistants conclusions possible administrative look opioid prescribing subset medicare patients i think conclusions assume generalizations data possible opioids commonly prescribed medicare recipients vast number prescriptions appear appropriately managed small number prescribers appear responsible inappropriate prescriptions outliers practicing extremes terms prescribing patterns extreme prescribing described cases would appear function unnecessary use rather patients special needs require extremely high doses opioids med mg important point concentrations high dose opioid prescribing often attributed special needs patients referral patterns resulting concentrations patients need prescriber write prescriptions amounts case biological variability much larger fraction patients require extreme amounts opioids problem inappropriate prescriber appears easy follow cms data base standard political approach opioid epidemic blame doctors mandate various education programs opioid prescribing clear minority physicians case prescribers problem targeted approach minimum prescribers top prescribers group prescribing extreme amounts opioids people probably doctor shopping receiving active feedback cms counting opioids prescribed cancer hospice care important omission problem little research policy making patients undergoing end life care prescribed liberal amounts opioids pain relief question patients adequate pain relief whatever medication necessary question happens opioids prescriptions patient never uses one palliative care study noted hospice care agencies responding poll third noted substance use diversion problem agency diversion drugs known occur health care systems monitoring checks balances large amounts opioids home hospice care settings much less accountability similar study looking amounts opioids prescribed settings happens medication needed opioids prescribed isolation cms oig medical research organizations comprehensive approach problem would look medications patients receiving opioids isolation benzodiazepines frequently accompany opioid prescriptions cases sedative hypnotics sleep prescribing compounds lead serious cases fatal drug interactions would result additional category inappropriate prescribing opioids although administrative database illustrate data used pharmacosurveillance purposes emphasis cost opioid prescribing need prevent fraud cms perspective data could also used provide valuable
