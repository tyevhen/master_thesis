higher levels global functioning epa dha data amount used various studies vary great deal ala flax oil found useful dha alone mania seem affected depression general functioning symptoms effect sizes strong enough intervention studied enough take lieu regular pharmacologic treatment bipolar disorder however adjunct risks may low compared possible benefits inositol also studied several times small
