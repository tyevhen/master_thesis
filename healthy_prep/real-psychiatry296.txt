i drove back home town twin cities area yesterday age connectedness times get false sense information wife called friend driving north duluth hwy got message inches snow freeway numerous vehicles ditch i mind driving snow i used drive north winter notoriously unreliable vehicles rear wheel drive limited slip differential poor weight distribution added bonus worst engineered cars world people age still use brand name positraction rather generic limited slip differential evidence pharmaceutical companies differ much businesses terms branding inserting public consciousness like people get point safety affordable buy i driving modern four wheel drive sport utility vehicle wd suv i confidant inches snow would problem congestion large trucks snow removal vehicles i also confidant would happen close twin cities competency snow removal seems vary directly latitude northern latitudes best i thought i drove hwy across northern wisconsin road clean pavement hours white conditions turned corner duluth grey skies lifted turned bright sunny day degrees colder day bad road way back twin cities happened pulled neighborhood inches snow driveway neighbors driveways clear many cases pavement dry clear physical chemistry snow always interesting case bottom millimeters snow liquefied upper inches plus medium density snow kind good cross country skiing clear liquid evaporates direct sunlight even well freezing temperature cases sublimation occurs snow vaporizes directly solid state i focused additional theories people living northern climes think lot moving snow epic snowfalls fantasies coming season included getting enclosed tractor climate control ability move massive amount snow image i condensation couple images first cola commercial many years ago set combines cutting wheat operators climate controlled cabs drinking coke pepsi second show building ice castles norway small vehicle described airport runway snowblower could move tremendous amount snow chute directly operators cab grandiose commercial induced fantasies even small tractor cab set move snow ridiculously expensive needs lot ongoing maintenance i never able locate manufacturer norwegian snow blower reality i year old toro stage snow thrower square feet sidewalk square feet driveway clear snow thrower cuts inch path many ways strategy mathematical practical efficient way clear away snow going back forth turning chute snow blower every turn something else since moving house i decided right angled arc starting left hand side driveway turning back turning chute snowblower heading back direction moves blown snow eastern side lot away sidewalk areas ice might accumulate also results fewer change chute direction going back forth length driveway mathematics aside practical aspects first course weather snow expected really want concentrate effort going another foot cases wet heavy snow imperative layer allowed freeze difficult handle snow blower case i left inch translucent slush i scrape shovel froze colder temperatures second surface clearing web sites recommend snowblower sizes based whether driveway finished asphalt concrete gravel case i two different surfaces concrete driveway textured concrete sidewalk i ca use steel shovel textured concrete i use plastic shovel similar metal shovel father used shovel coal steam engine one earliest recollection placed cab steam locomotive father locomotive fireman time engine hand fired job keep coal burning keep steam pressure explained me time scoop shaped shovel designed slide large amounts coal furnace without wasting energy clear sidewalk i clear one edge cut across using motion father used shovel coal snow lot lighter coal takes me passes clear using motion every pass i careful extend stroke onto grass inches father first taught me shovel snow said critical event melting snow without inch margin water pooled sidewalk created ice margin water soaked grass ice formed i tried pass knowledge along sidewalk shovelers falls deaf ears either believe me theories shoveling addition theory clearing snow carrying i get another thought years ago i always insomniac one night back i waiting father come home work railroad engineer drove freight iron ore trains midnight snowing drifting depth feet street outside home told me day left might need plow snow tracks worst case scenario would hitting deep snow blowing diesel engine air intakes top locomotive would kill engines result long restarting process would slow i kept staring window wind intense i could hear trains even though blocks tracks i could finally see leaning wind snow always wore union style clothes none really made winter weather wore chromer cap ear flaps offered limited protection carrying leather satchel called grip contained important paperwork wading hip deep snow using exaggerated hurdler motion use travel deep snow without snowshoes i happy see even happier burst kitchen smelled like fresh air version diesel fuel lucky strikes leather i greater appreciation events i used early easy grasp psychodynamic significance especially came countertransferences toward mechanics anyone else might smell diesel fuel cigarettes office associated issues blue collar rage exploitation union workers stronger affiliation workers rather management days i think terms brain systems represented underlying mechanisms allow experience i still feel happy i image father pushing deep snow toward home probably accounts degree affiliation snow winter weather every month i give lecture talk time frame neuroscience structures probably responsible experience i remind students structures allow unique human experience i like say billion humans earth billion unique conscious states i suppose planning fantasizing clearing snow unique upper midwest i doubt two learned exact way george dawson md dfapa
