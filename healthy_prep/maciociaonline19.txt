i presenting chinese medicine view cancer patterns treatment principle herbs herbal formulae many patient cancer cancer reason i think extremely important understand cancer point view chinese medicine even actually treat moreover even treat cancer patients survived cancer great service develop treatment strategies prevent recurrence chinese books try prove concept cancer already nei jing later books truth ancient books fairly comprehensive theory tumours concept malignancy differentiation benign malignant tumours however passages clearly indicate treating tumours ancient doctors well aware condition indicated poor prognosis example text song dynasty says describing ru yan i hard breast lump broken patient saved broken treatment difficult palpation hard rock hence name ru yan breast rock treated late ulcerate spread zang organs fatal please note descriptions tumours ancient books one actually describe secondary infections cancer rather cancer pathology tongue shows one case seldom see infections women seek western treatment much earlier ancient chinese women would done moreover chinese medicine theory cancer refers masses therefore envisage cancer without masses blood tumours leukemia myeloma spite fact chinese medicine concept malignancy i believe lot offer four areas treat cancer without western treatment treat cancer integration western treatment treat side effects chemotherapy radiotherapy prevent recurrence western treatment chapter nan jing introduces term ji ju indicating masses distinguish ji ju ji masses yin ju masses yang yin deep hidden yang superficial moves accumulates gives rise ji masses gathers gives rise ju masses ji masses originate zang ju masses originate fu ji masses made yin fixed location pain boundaries edges right left i clearly defined borders ju masses made yang seem start nowhere without boundary moving pain abdominal masses called ji ju ji indicates actual abdominal masses immovable associated pain location fixed masses due stasis blood i call blood masses ju indicates abdominal masses come go fixed location movable associated pain comes goes changes location masses due stagnation i call masses actual abdominal lumps therefore pertain category abdominal masses specifically ji masses due blood stasis i call blood masses another name abdominal masses zheng jia zheng equivalent ji i actual fixed masses jia ju i non substantial masses stagnation zheng jia normally used referring abdominal masses generally occur women occur men well though rarely su wen chapter says diseases ren mai women masses waist context su wen uses term jia ju i non substantial masses stagnation prescriptions golden cabinet jin gui yao lue zhang zhong jing says ji masses arise yin organs moved ju masses arise yang organs come go pain fixed location easier treat general treatise aetiology symptoms diseases ad says abdominal masses due cold heat regulated i exposure extremes weather irregular diet stagnation yin organs move called zheng movable called jia jia implies meaning false masses come go actual masses terminology liu tumour zhong liu tumour cancer shi yong stone carbuncle condition described old books could correspond cancers ai modern word cancer yan rock description tumours hard could correspond cancer ji ju nan jing masses described chapter nan jing zheng jia gynaecological abdominal masses aetiology pathology cancer patterns main patterns appearing cancer blood stasis phlegm toxic heat blood stasis abdominal masses cancer colon carcinoma breast ovarian cancer phlegm brain tumour breast carcinoma lymphoma toxic heat cancers spread rapidly dampness skin cancer cancer characterized dampness note many types cancer blood stasis phlegm example breast colon lung prostate combination blood stasis phlegm particularly serious patient without cancer actively treated tongue important factor diagnose combination blood stasis phlegm blood stasis purple stiff phlegm swollen sticky coating purple swollen purple swollen sticky coating purple swollen purple swollen treatment strategies difference cancer diseases underlying xu identification patterns basis treatment enough different approach treatment integrate chinese diagnosis western diagnosis integrate chinese western treatment f cancers chinese disease underlying xu cancer seen differently disease always assume underlying xu i mean general sense zheng therefore including yang blood yin xu diseases never assume xu assume situation xu cancer develops long period time accumulation blood phlegm occur without underlying xu another important difference cancer disease consumes please note xu mean tonify zheng cases cancer identification patterns basis treatment enough treat cancer without pattern differentiation disease however pattern identification alone enough cancer one reason assume always zheng xu never make assumptions diseases another difference choice herbs guided pattern differentiation also modern research anti cancer effect another factor surgery cancer surgery cancer entirely diagnose chinese perspective example breast lumps benign malignant diagnose palpation phlegm blood stasis obviously longer possible surgery different approach treatment first difference cancer assume deficiency zheng therefore must use tonics every case second important difference choice herbs guided also modern research third important difference treatment principle according stage disease diseases generally beginning stage one expels pathogenic factors late stage one tonifies opposite cancer i beginning stage one primarily tonifies late stage one primarily expels pathogenic factors emphasis word primarily one always adopts approaches stage example another disease might ms beginning stages invasion dampness treatment principle therefore eliminate dampness disease progresses deficiency stomach spleen later deficiency yin liver kidneys late stages therefore one must tonify zheng cancer beginning stage characterized deficiency zheng without would cancer one therefore primarily tonify prevent cancer growing spreading late stages pathology cancer characterized strong pathogenic factors i blood stasis phlegm toxic heat i repeat stress word primarily always adopt treatments i tonify zheng expel pathogenic factors different proportions according stage beginning stage late stage diseases expel pathogenic factor tonify zheng cancer tonify zheng expel pathogenic factors integrate chinese diagnosis western diagnosis course obvious never rely palpation chinese diagnosis breast lumps example applies cancer another example would prostate cancer man urinary retention never treat without prostate biopsy ascertain whether carcinoma western diagnosis also presents new opportunities ancient chinese doctors would example cervical dysplasia diagnosed pap smear test treat usually successfully may turn cervical cancer integrate chinese western treatment cases need integrate treatment western treatment i chemotherapy radiotherapy surgery times i used chinese treatment patient strongly western treatment chemotherapy radiotherapy attention directed treating cancer supporting zheng treatments chemotherapy radiotherapy make clear diagnosis whether still strong pathogenic factors order decide whether primarily tonify primarily expel pathogenic factors f cancers chinese disease besides pattern identification bian zheng must also identify disease bian bing cancer manifests wide variety chinese diseases thus must familiar aetiology pathology chinese disease cancer manifests thus although must treat cancer differently diseases must also master aetiology pathology chinese disease corresponding particular type cancer treating give many indications treatment choice prescriptions

bone consumption bone cancer hou bi throat bi throat cancer ge zhong diaphragm swelling carcinoma oesophagus shi jia stone masses carcinoma uterus approach treatment western treatment important clear idea approach treatment patient western treatment chemotherapy radiotherapy surgery see many patients treatment approach depends type treatment basically one must decide whether primarily tonify zheng aim preventing recurrence cancer whether still primarily expel pathogenic factors spite western treatment received example woman breast cancer phlegm mastectomy make sense still resolve phlegm cases yes i choose treatment principle lot according tongue pulse tongue pulse show full condition i primarily expel pathogenic factors always addition herbs tonify zheng support immune system tongues indicating primarily full conditions swollen thick coating purple stiff tongues indicating primarily empty condition purple swollen thin coating coating purple thick coating purple swollen red thick dry coating pulse indicating full condition full slippery wiry possibly rapid pulse indicating empty condition weak fine choppy thus tongue pulse indicate primarily full condition i treat patient still cancer choose herbal formula first i refer chinese disease corresponding type cancer order see chinese formula adapted patient apart chinese disease formula must also based pattern therefore good pattern identification essential i modify formula three ways make additions subtractions according patient condition way i would disease add herbs proven anti cancer effect according modern research herbs also treat presenting pattern even better example huang yao zi anti cancer effect resolves phlegm would therefore choose herb phlegm add herbs tonify zheng stimulate immune system also anti cancer effect better approach treatment chemotherapy radiotherapy treatment treatment chemotherapy radiotherapy i treat patterns tonify zheng order support organism treatment chemotherapy i use three treasures remedy chemo support radiotherapy radio support treatment principle chemo support tonify zheng resolve dampness clear heat radiotherapy i use three treasures remedy radio support treatment principle radio support nourish cool invigorate blood information chemo support found three treasures newsletters summer information radio support found three treasures newsletters winter information chemotherapy antioxidants found three treasures newsletters spring please note effects radiotherapy long lasting i therefore advocate using radio support least months end treatment
