science often happens finding answer particular mystery leads questions certainly case non heme manganese based catalases bacteria i talked previous post regardless origin catalases faclitate breakdown hydrogen peroxide water oxygen nearly universal heme based catalase found almost every living thing comes large subunit small subunit varieties always fairly big amino acids coli manganese catalases contrast always fairly small around amino acids one group manganese catalases comes amino acids larger typical manganese catalase i wanted know catalases bigger finding answer hard i got lucky answer leads questions turns organisms manufacture big manganese catalase organisms question belong genera rhizobium bradyrhizobium rhodopseudomonas closely related mesorhizobium mn catalase normal size mn catalase meanwhile cousin sinorhizobium mn catalase first amino acids mn catalases made rhizobium bradyrhizobium rhodopseudomonas align quite well normal size mn catalases made organisms difference amino acid trailer end long versions i used alignment editor mega tantamount notepad cut trailer portion one sequences paste blast search field uniprot org search protein database revealed something quite interesting trailer portion bradyrhizobium mn catalase identity match enteric bacteria ycif gene quite good match considering phylogenetic distance coli bradyrhizobium coli ycif gene top match bradyrhizobium ycif gene middle turn match trailer portion katn manganese catalase gene bradyrhizobium bottom investigation left little doubt big mn catalases indeed fusion proteins ycif fused terminal end mn catalase world ycif turns widely distributed highly conserved protein uncertain function protein purified crystal structure determined resolution function still uncertain know stress inducible along yci series genes seems bind metal ligand probably iron shares structural features rubrerythrin non heme iron protein implicated oxidative stress protection anaerobic bacteria archaea coli strains mn catalase ycif gene occurs two genes upstream side catalase katn gene ycif widely distributed highly conserved manganese catalase mn catalase producers including fusion enzyme additional separate copy ycif seems likely me anyway fusion protein created chance common ancestor rhizobiales original katn gene laid phage mobile genetic element coli katn often occurs near phage genes sinorhizobium lost combo gene entirely mesorhizobium makes small mn catalase either obtained katn lost trailer fusion protein time since bradyrhizobium others already separate ycif gene mystery trailer portion fusion gene continues exist might well provide favorable enhancement katn function somehow maybe exploiting iron auxiliary catalytic center trailer nothing useful disappeared time maybe disappear rhizobiales members disappeared yet three genera still make big enzyme i feeling trailer piece something useful unfortunately one characterized braydrhizobium mn catalase yet experimentally probably wait happens find big enzyme capable
