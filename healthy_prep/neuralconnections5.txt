i put working new post relating hippocampal connectivity write occurred me tomorrow would make nice post memory i tried get i failed hours i realized around pm i naturally started thinking flashbulb memories led writing post hopefully somewhat informative flashbulb memories contain vivid details regular memories also accompanied enhanced confidence reporting details flashbulb memories reported 'occur striking events highly dramatic either good bad individuals recall enhanced detail time heard specific location heard wearing etc although flawlessly often reported large stories like presidential assassinations space shuttle challenger explosion jump emotional memories different flashbulb memories episodic memories also video clip flashbulb memories psychologists neuroscientists consensus whether flashbulb memories distinct neural mechanism encoding recall case increased attention given event flashbulb memories started researched heavily president kennedy assassination brown kulik first termed phrase findings enhancement details recalled asking assassination jfk suspected memories distinct neural mechanisms encoding event 'triggered surprise perceived emotional valence distinctness others picture however mccloskey et al state flashbulb memories special like 'ordinary memories terms neural machinery involved memories decay rate regular memories susceptible forgetting details accurate ordinary control memories strikingly different confidence reported recall flashbulb memories ordinary memories even details shown wrong people flashbulb memories still claim completely accurate whereas memories proclaimed flashbulbs confidence reported recall lower appears person thinks remember based distinctiveness event boosts confidence ratings increase accuracy upon recall logically flashbulb memories special stance easily argued memories remember events national media coverage generated much talk amongst others discussing event hence given attention water cooler effect even flashbulb memory covered media often find rehearsing head talking others writing interacting memory normally 'normal memories finkenauer et al neurally identify whether memories caused attention frequent rehearsal mechanisms carry specific encoding mechanisms create perma memories permanent storage memory whole heck lot known due ethical restrictions induce highly emotional memories would likely constitute flashbulb memory therefore study encoding memories untenable however study emotional encoding memories closest trying induce fbm encoding emotional memories humans largely followed foot steps rodent research higher cognitive degree learned amygdala primary mover encoding emotional memories amygdala also affects explicit memory recall enhancing activation cortical subcortical areas involved stress hormones also release response emotional stimuli interacts hippocampus indirectly amygdala modulatory mechanisms amygdala directly consolidation process memory storage left emotions modulatory effect encoding consolidation right fmri activity correlation map positive stimuli correlation map negative stimuli correlated activity yellow imaging studies provided window encoding process emotional memories hamann et al shown amount bilateral amygdalar activity time encoding predictive accuracy time recognition one month later right picture recall right scanning case non arousing stimuli sharot et al scanned brains people either downtown nyc closer scene world trade center crashes midtown nyc found stronger amygdalar activity upon recalling details day downtown group group finding suggests personal experience closer scene may reflect psychological mechanism amygdala modulates memory check memory one researchers involved consortium researchers check brain apparatus think think jon simons cambridge however fact still remains whether special neural circuitry dedicated encoding recall flashbulb memories opposed regular emotional memories lack details terms psychology memory may make sense term enhancement recall recognition terms neuroscience memory neural activity connectivity thereof may non sequitur trying assign special circuitry types memories memory encoded always going engage different regions event highly emotional makes sense would engage areas tell me think fbm psychologically neurally special happy birthday blog one month old today survived another day references brown r kulik flashbulb memories cognition mccloskey wible cohen special flashbulb memory mechanism journal experimental psychology general finkenauer et al flashbulb memories underlying mechanisms formation toward emotional integrative model memory cognition hamann et al amygdala activity related enhanced memory pleasant aversive stimuli nat neurosci sharot martorella delgado r phelps personal experience modulates neural circuitry memories september pnas
