storm rolls minneapolis photo eduardo col md like psychiatrists i spent lot time listening anxieties hypotheticals people judging me i public i fail examination i end penniless homeless i really dying something doctors ca diagnose i going lose control drive bridge way work relationship i ever find another person love me human mind set obsess improbable predisposition create hypervigilant approach anxious stream consciousness lead much less sleep number physical symptoms many people patterns thoughts years decades decide see psychiatrist psychotherapist kind anxiety disabling even without panic attacks significant physical manifestations outstanding example emotion impacts decisions case decision worry something recognized illogical one standard questions anxious person involves catastrophizing jumping worst possible conclusion also universal human experience best example assuming worst family member late driving place ditch emergency room accident dead common thoughts various people get situation comes real catastrophes thought patterns change significantly i always interested catastrophes ever since i read book kid meteor hitting earth days used go bookmobile stop get large recreational vehicle functioned mobile library borrow books read every week book caught eye picture collision cover detailed description events inside time real risk massive destruction standoff ussr cuban missile blockade decision soviet submarine commander taxpayers always last know worried plenty real crisis time i reading first page novel meteor hitting earth destruction would involve years lead focus survive unsurvivable i referred myself survivalist times realize i half joking real survivalists tend see catastrophic events impacting food supply i heard credo meals away chaos associated strategies food hoarding secure locations plenty firearms necessary i think logical think food supply may constrained quantity volume i think also logical take approach involves maximizes survival human race anything short destruction planet personal involvement disaster planning peaked years ago time i involved avian influenza task forces one localized hospital i working metro statewide influenza pandemic lethal event result tens millions deaths last time world population subjected highly lethal strain people going work morning dropping dead streets way home evening participation task forces highly instructive number issues i involved teaching psychological first aid pfa theory fairly simple people suffer psychological trauma mass event like epidemic recover psychologically focus reassurance providing information preventing surges activity hospitals emergency departments would overwhelm resources theory based happened concern anthrax sent capitol building occurred event emergency department ed services immediately overwhelmed people thought exposed anthrax prevent trained pfa staff would ed areas assist keeping people moving unfortunate reality real infrastructure ventilators isolation rooms would almost immediately overwhelmed even appropriate surge protection nobody adequate infrastructure treat high numbers people respiratory failure infected highly virulent strains influenza virus nobody interested building infrastructure nobody interested hvac heating ventilating air conditioning systems isolate infected people interest getting oseltamivir phosphate tamiflu whoever needed i saw slide several times large pallets boxed oseltamivir sitting large government hangar somewhere told ready shipped whoever might need also interest large numbers dead bodies fairly specific plans detail end logical conclusion planners event fairly hopeless outcome trying quell either expected mass hysteria inability marshall realistic resources i seen i would expect better outcome unless effective vaccines immediately available non biological catastrophes broader scope potentially devastating recent overview julia rosen science illustrates possibilities interesting aspect non biological catastrophes necessary need kind hard fix needs basic shelter someone figure go space either destroy displace asteroid hurtling toward earth imaginary hospital bed capacity like biological epidemic real shelter real intercept device part human race perishes according rosen even scientists subjected pervasive giggle factor many see study prevention catastrophes mainstream science body rosen article discusses natural events decimate infrastructure could lead extinction humans example event probably directly harmful humans coronal mass ejection

significant environmental impact direct blast toxic gases like sulfur dioxide whenever i discuss issues friends coworkers i get nervous laughter mentioned science article people ca seem believe anyone thinking things endpoints spectrum include nuts one end i going run outside stand mushroom cloud i would rather dead living basement year sentiments captured cormac mccarthy post apocalyptic novel road novel boy father wander dangerous post catastrophe countryside actual event never specified widespread famine climate change primitive behaviors including constant confrontations food cannibalism flashbacks wife mother dyad learn able cope new reality committed suicide one point encounter old man along road wants food tension father son father wants move son still altruistic wants help old man point conversation old man sums situation asked tried get ready would even knew would know would know wanted suppose last one left suppose p mccarthy masterful job capturing attitudes resilient hopeless altruistic catastrophe also illustrates truly catastrophic conditions nihilism may logical conclusion hope still lives minds others i encountered attitudes discussing prospects survival anecdotal experience people planning survive seem planning confrontations shoot outs directly road i think outcome much positive survival enhancing optimal comes survival human race take enlightened approach food shelter requires generations planning requires multidisciplinary planning gradually change infrastructure i able get critical reference complete post listed rosen article book widely reviewed possible solution food storage possible suggested food sources would useful sun blocking catastrophe like supervolcano nuclear winter high speed impact neo vegetation could grown gradual large scale changes infrastructure could also result permanent dwellings designed provide fresh food water occupants well waste disposal hvac systems would function highly adverse environment supply clean air absence major power disruptions encouraging gradual change goals mind much better position take preventing post catastrophe panic psychiatrist involved disaster planning real solution always
