well many contributing factors let me add one report recent meeting society neuroscience found patients alzheimers mention changes sleep patterns months diagnosed nap longer fitful high sleep disturbance index offers correlation index help make diagnosis generating causes another piece sleep apnea also associated disease chronic apnea twice likely develop alzheimers later high levels beta amyloid clump around nerve cells affect proper nerve transmission hyperactive brains combined long daily naps sleep apnea produce alzheimers disease contribution i seen apnea patients relive birth consistently lose breath seem dead minute attempt breathing put mirror mouths nothing happens right reliving drugged birth seems part birth process due massive input anesthesia birth process breathing shut minute two seem relive sudden jerk come begin i term locomotive breathing raspy hoarse lasts many minutes system tries recuperate oxygen deprived trauma apnea seems become chronic imprint follows person throughout life seems stop patients relive birth process anoxia short longer driven imprinted memory oxygen deprivation create early trauma something else early traumas produce hyperactive brain tries overcome imprint death threatening events imprint must combatted system attack oxygen deprivation memory deprivation way brain remembers deprivation love course brain driven constantly bound dementia eventually working overtime long time top level brain cells recruited battle many times due imprint feeling therapy reliving essential stopping onset disease need slow sleep disturbance marker alzheimers signifies overactive brain brain driven lower level imprints keep top level busy allow drop deep sleep levels imprinted pain use sleep aids suppress pain allow descent unconscious since sleep apnea highly correlated later alzheimers need ask question need know apnea comes guess traumatic birth major factor simple speculation i seen relivings patients heavily drugged birth becomes key marker appearance disease let neglect
