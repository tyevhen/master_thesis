like me probably thrilled see javascript support come bundled jdk jre using implementation straight box far better execution speed trick get rhino jar js jar directly mozilla include classpath use built rhino support jdk jre slow i first noticed speed difference regular rhino jdk rhino back february i testing script manipulates images see blog post voronoi tessellation linear time one situation i found running script using jre interpreter took two full minutes whereas script finished six seconds i used js jar i decided follow running couple highly unscientific tests one case i came script designed test interpreter speed handling numeric operations another case i wrote script designed test string handling memory management results revealing test numerical efficiency i implemented one euler remarkable expansion series calculating pi euler famously found summed squares reciprocals positive integers result asymptotically approaches pi squared javascript implementation looks like function piterms sum whileterms sum return math sqrt sum i ran number trials interpreter using values terms graph shows results execution time plotted vertically scale ranges zero milliseconds numerical efficiency test vertical axis represents execution time notice jre starts slower execution time rises faster rhino red line steeper slope incidentally million terms function produces value pi bad parts per hundred million series converge quickly enough practical use modern computers second test designed test string handling memory management kludgy combined fashion folks meant highly scientific swag code looks like function strings iterations str abc whilea iterations str str whilea str split join bit silliness grows string concatenating repeatedly splits string array characters rejoins array form string pass iterations value make string double size times crashing known version rhino oome thus i tested values execution time topped millisec jre ms rhino notice red curve starts higher rises steeper slope btw want see raw data graphs inspect urls images google chart dynamic images raw numbers urls i say intended highly scientific set tests i believe representative reality though reality bare naked rhino significantly faster embedded jre rhino whatever want i seen enough data i made decision bare naked way go
