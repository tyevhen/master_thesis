big data data science buzzwords science industry decade medline search shows thousand current references big data healthcare good starting point consider meant big data discuss implications quick scan references shows vary greatly technical complexity standard definition google extremely large data sets may analyzed computationally reveal patterns trends associations especially relating human behavior interactions techniques developed widespread availability digitized data ease sets behavioral choices form mouse clicks collected web sites many cases specific data collection paradigms used elicit information also wealth static data well health care electronic health record massive source static data financial real estate educational records records transactions also significant source americans logging set social security account online ssa gov past couple years would surprised takes complete job preliminary information set security questions four questions detailed personal credit history home mortgage information credit card history social security initially set widespread concern social security numbers would become national identifiers one point congress assure electorate number would used purpose since ssn used multiple identification purposes including credit reporting point seems come full circle congress invented ssn told people would identifier mandated use identifier congress authorized basically invented credit reporting system united states federal government currently uses credit reporting system quiz taxpayers wanting set social security account online meantime large amounts financial legal health care data collected ssn data systems everywhere point full amount data reasons collected person unknown collected without knowledge consent impossible opt data collection federal government initiative remove ssns health records many identifiers right effort little late additional sources data include online foot print including sites may

revenue source based scale personalization ads effective big data seems good business downside brings me current resource nefarious uses big data written expert field cathy o'neil phd mathematics phd work algebraic number theory started work academician subsequently worked hedge fund work data scientist several firms currently heads lede program data journalism columbia university i familiar work blog mathbabe newly released book weapons math destruction takes look dark side big data specifically data collection biased algorithms good administrators politicians business bad anyone falls influence agencies work introduction leads example teacher assessments i familiar scattergram posted web site showing year year teacher assessment scores essentially uncorrelated random book describes human toll case teacher fired defective algorithm another example later book experienced teacher scored value added teacher evaluation tenure kept getting fired scoring algorithm opaque nobody could tell happened next year scored algorithm flawed knew score legitimate last one politicized environment surrounding teaching proponents teacher accountability like variation since fits ideas system retaining incompetent teachers need weeded fact algorithm defective like many based erroneous assumptions i personally know physicians subjected processes teachers far less technologically advanced o'neill points nothing magical algorithms frequently incorporate biases people design contract opacity lack correction feedback another feature i worked employer number years physician accountability measures put place algorithm salary went something like rvu productivity outside billing citizenship pay rvus total number patients seen according biased government managed care billing schemes outside billing consulting work done outside clinical work billed department citizenship included teaching administrative duties well grand rounds cme lectures done words apart subjectively based billing scheme inputs almost totally subjective influenced kinds pseudoaccountability measures along way example parallel teacher ranked algorithm i told one year i achieved top rank terms documentation group physicians next year making changes terms documentation i dead last conclusion like teacher example rating scheme completely bogus kind scheme cares results number based algorithms applied physicians eerie parallels mentioned wmd i picked first read algorithm based faulty data teacher evaluation algorithms based faulty interpretation data nation risk report report concluded teachers responsible declining sat scores sandia labs reanalyzed data years later found great expansion number people taking test responsible decreased average score subgroup analysis income group showed improved scores group p reason teachers still blamed political convention i posted several years ago top ranked students world finland taught teachers assumed professionals critiqued test results parallel medicine entire reason medicine currently managed government healthcare industry based criticism doctors lining pockets performing unnecessary procedures work quality poor sound familiar criticism carried forward despite major study showed completely wrong massive peer review standards organizations prso state conducted rigorous reviews medicare hospitalizations concluded little overutilization quality problems would pay continue program reason managed care companies exist today political convention effective teacher like effective doctor complex model happens indirect measures crude proxies p used estimate effectiveness medicine like teaching proxy measures incredibly crude generally depend diagnosis poorly account comorbid illness outcome measures heavily influenced business rather medical decision making best examples length stay parameter readmission parameters every physician knows set payment schedules based supposed ideal length stay particular illness business influence discharge decision malignant days non physician case managers present pressure physicians discharging patients discharge beats length stay parameter hospital makes money i sat meeting one point asked obvious question ok completed discharge checklist know outcomes patients discharged process many die dead silence followed people would shocked hear passes evidence based medicine often checklist meaning real world making points checklist good advertising though lack transparency overall process teachers wmd blindsided algorithm never told conclusion reached i encountered problem managed care organization clear me administrators knowledge psychiatry telling cases consultants brought write reports confirm recent administrative edicts i asked boss i could talk people sending edicts i informed firewall clinicians upper management lack feedback another critical dimension algorithms gone astray writing algorithm biased toward business goal would want feedback clinicians would want humanity clinical judgment added especially case psychiatric care let dangerousness algorithm leave people get acute treatment even though patently unfair relative rest medicine works big data good science ca elementary particle physics genomic analysis well without big data also good business much different ways clearly people resist buying items online amazon algorithm shows enough times across number web pages big data business also come billing algorithms less reality making profit similar programs found employee scheduling performance analysis downsizing problems happens business biases big data introduced science medicine techniques responsible array pseudoquality pseudoaccountability measures physicians hospitals clinics unfortunately physicians seem given political conventions put upon administrator somewhere suggests quality care depends patient portal electronic health record certain number emails sent patient physician every month across country result hundreds millions emails physicians already burned creating highly stylized documentation used billing purposes terabytes useless information nobody ever read product totally subjective billing coding process started two decades ago data email communication tied effectiveness technical expertise physician i doubt i worked great physicians long email existed time somebody pointed manipulations provide plenty leverage management class country expense everyone else well past time doctors confronting charade george dawson md dfapa references cathy o'neill weapons math destruction big data increases inequality threatens democracy crown publishing group new york ny i highly recommend book look side big data written non technical language readable attribution
