everyone tweeting new paper i say doozy i recommend many papers fairly painful read though many papers full interesting facts teach scientists write get hands one please intestinal microbiota affect central levels brain derived neurotropic factor behavior mice let dive ooh i like first part intestinal microbiota vast ecosystem shapes wide variety host functions within outside gastrointestinal tract y'all may recall previous article evidence commensal beasties make cells also control mouse brain possibly something like paper experimental design excite me endocannabinoid rat paper i wrote yesterday i doubt probably endocannabinoid receptors corn oil may activated kinds fats guts ones sweets mouths i sure means isolated way via sham feeding creepy rat chow liquid diets immediately drain dribble onto rat cage gross gut slurry however keep mind rodents diverged family tree many many many millions years ago back beasties found colonization germ free mice bacteroides species affect expression messenger rna encode immune smooth muscle function gut permeability gut nervous system regulation body weight pain perception skin also shown affected changes microbiota healthy folks intestinal microbiota diverse species relatively stable conditions inflammatory bowel disease crohn ulcerative colitis ibd irritable bowel syndrome ibs beastie species less diverse tend unstable time ibd ibs depression anxiety common associated worse gastrointestinal disease ibs studies shown people affected also psychiatric symptoms psychiatric symptoms caused discomfort stress living irritable inflammatory bowel conditions symptoms caused pathology causes gut issues includes alteration intestinal microbiota previous experimental evidence gut bacteria affect brain includes mice microbiota shown affect hypothalamic pituitary response stress oral antibiotics seem help people suffering neurological complications end stage liver disease pathogenic bacteria introduced gut causes anxiety like behavior mice experiment researchers obtained regular germ free mice lived thereafter level ii biocontainment germ free mice remained germ free others got fecal transplants mice known bacterial species board mice got whopping dose antibiotics nonabsorbable presumably affected gut microbiota separate experiment small amount antibiotics injected systemically mice acted back control affect gut microbiota control mice lapped sterile water instead mice gut contents extracted cultured bacterial dna rna characterized via polymerase chain reaction gel electrophoresis could see kind beasties survived various treatments experimental control group mice mice also underwent behavioral testing open exploration quick step raised platform etc addition researchers pretty darn thorough gut linings examined signs inflammation cytokines neurotransmitter levels small intestine colon measured brains specifically sections hippocampus amygdala extracted measured levels brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf bdnf brain fertilizer whose levels hippocampus amygdala correlate depression anxiety symptoms low bdnf hippocampus generally bad news associated depression anxiety symptoms antidepressants thought work increasing levels bdnf amygdala fear center brain lower levels bdnf seem correlate less fear still me song strokes taken fool right click open new tab window want shipped away page results well whopping antibiotic administration affect beastie species guts mice lactobacilli actinobacteria populations increased treatment bacteroides gamma proteobacteria decreased including shigella klebsiella mice exposed antibiotics exploratory less apprehensive control mice two weeks however behavioral testing control antibiotic treated mice back measures beastie populations showed went back normal germ free mice antibiotic administration nothing affect behavior showing likely alterations beastie population caused behavioral change experimental group finally germ free mice got fecal transplants showed changes behavior colonized compared germ free controls see researchers went backwards forwards sideways prove findings pretty cool really results mice got whopping dose antibiotics higher levels bdnf hippocampus lower amounts bdnf amygdala compared control mice bdnf levels would expect less anxious fearful mice open exploring controls antibiotic treated mice changes cytokines guts suggest increased inflammation increased pathologic inflammatory markers microscope changes gut neurotransmitters behavior bdnf changes nothing gut inflammation enteric nervous system least involving neurotransmitters tested included biggies results study provide strong evidence microbiota gut brain axis influences brain biochemistry modulates behavior adult mice another paper researchers showed mice lacking gut sympathetic nervous system via severing vagus nerve using chemical neurotoxins kill sympathetic nervous system affected addition campylobacter gut pathogen gut induced anxiety normal mice thus anxiety behavior seemed mediated via communication gut brain via vagus nerve current paper group mice severed vagus nerve another group exposed neurotoxin results mice untouched nervous systems thus change behavior changes bdnf brain brought antibiotic treatment gut occurred another mechanism researchers thought substances produced gut bacteria likely acted directly indirectly central nervous system somehow another recent paper showed mice fed beef enriched diet three months early childhood mouse puppyhood improved memory compared rats fed standard rat chow i sure exactly linked entirely gut bacteria mentioned paper i thought cool fact researchers already shown administration probiotics could normalize behavior mice showed alterations behavior mild moderate gut inflammation told i think scientists beginning elucidate pretty fascinating area interest psychiatrists gastroenterologists mouse enthusiasts everywhere
