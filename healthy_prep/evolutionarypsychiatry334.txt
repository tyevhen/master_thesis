ketogenic diets prescribed seizures long time actual research diets used past pretty dismal seemed involve drinking lot cream eating lot mayonnaise johns hopkins pediatric patients admitted hospital hour fast given eggnog minus rum sugar i guessing ketosis achieved usually took days addition ketogenic diets calorie restricted would considered child usual calorie intake often fluid restricted talking soybean oil mayonnaise could see someone could get trouble mineral deficiencies liver problems pretty quickly understand dismal latest research showed modified atkins protocol good classic ketogenic diet much liberating patients allowed grams carbohydrates daily begin fast calorie restricted classic ketogenic diet fat carbs protein use mct oil calories add slowly though prevent vomiting diarrhea cramping could increase carbohydrates proteins fat carb protein still get numbers magical ketones circulating mct oil sounds nice yummy gorgeous coconut milk mct oil pure fl oz look quite appetizing especially going half eat foreseeable future see researchers consider ketogenic diets especially original versions extremely difficult unappetizing whereas seasoned low carbers bit different idea ketogenic diet find attitude ridiculous especially compare ketogenic diet side effects anti epileptic medications looks like modified atkins low carb zero carb preponderance mct ketone wise brain classic cream heavy ketogenic diet mean ketogenic brain talked protons i going examine neurotransmitters brain energy closely specifically glutamate gaba recall gaba major inhibitory neurotransmitter mammalian nervous system turns gaba made glutamate happens major excitatory neurotransmitter need seem get trouble much glutamate much excitement brain means neurotoxicity extreme manifestation seizures neurological diseases varied depression bipolar disorder migraines als dementia linked way neurotoxicity glutamate several fates rather like old buddy tryptophan become gaba inhibitory aspartate excitatory excess neurotoxic ketogenic diets seem favor glutamate becoming gaba rather aspartate one knows exactly part reason ketones metabolized ketosis favors using acetate acetoacetate one ketone bodies fuel acetate becomes glutamine essential precursor gaba confusing part classic ketogenic diet three major components thought contribute anti seizure effect one calorie restricted calorie restricting epileptic monkeys matter macronutrient ratios reduces seizure frequency increases longevity secondly acidic extra protons could block proton sensitive ion channels ketone bodies fats could affect neuron membranes making harder excite biochem geeks ketones fats seem affect atp sensitive k ion channels making hyperpolarization easier maintain thirdly lowered glucose levels lower glucose associated higher seizure threshold good want easily seizure less neuronal excitability gads sound me like glucose really preferred fuel brain let really get mitochondrial level mitochondria power plants cells energy produced atp i taught biochemical fuel burning i taught glucose clean ketones smokey glucose clearly preferred fuel muscles exercise definitely key fuel brain except dirty little secret glucose look amount garbage leftover mitochondria actually less efficient make atp glucose make atp ketone bodies efficient energy supply makes easier restore membranes brain normal states depolarizing electrical energy spike occurs means energy produced fewer destructive free radicals leftover umph mean well brain energy everything brain needs crapload energy keep membrane potentials maintained keep pushing sodium cells pulling potassium cells fact brain body weight uses oxygen glucose stores keep running cells brain actually small tendrils small accommodate mitochondria power plants places must use glucose via glycolysis create atp change main fuel brain glucose ketones change amino acid handling means change ratios glutamate gaba best responders ketogenic diet epilepsy end highest amount gaba central nervous system one things brain keep tight rein amount glutamate hanging synapse lots glutamate synapse means brain injury seizures low level ongoing damaging excitotoxicity might see depression brain humming along using energy like madman even little bit efficient use energy makes easier brain pull glutamate back cells friends good thing let me put way breastmilk high fat newborns spend lot time ketosis therefore ketoadapted ketoadapted means babies easily turn ketone bodies acetyl coa myelin ketosis helps babies construct grow brains update looked specifically seems babies mild ketosis young babies seem utilize lactate fuel lieu glucose also rat studies though utilization lactate also promotes use acetyl coa gives neonates advantages ketoadaptation without heavy ketosis know less means epilepsy babies precisely know means everyone else least brain wise ketosis occurs carbohydrate restriction mct oil use fasting people believe ketoadapted ideal others suggest relaxed eat mostly low sugar diet bit intermittent fasting thrown give periods ketosis though general i recommend intermittent fasting anyone eating disorder ketosis body means fat burning hip hip hooray brain means lower seizure risk better environment neuronal recovery repair
