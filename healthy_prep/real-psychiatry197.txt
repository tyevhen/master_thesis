morbidity mortality weekly report mmwr october i advocate real pharmacosurveillance anyone prescribing medications united states might seem like controversial statement needs argued couple levels privacy advocates suggest medication information protected information sensitive medical information extrapolated prescriptions medical diagnoses seen equal eyes employers average citizens era knowledge person significant amount specific medication possession may also put risk theft exploitation good reasons making sure information leaked general public overriding argument public safety defined making sure person seeking medical help going see competent physicians era competent prescribers many reasons prescriber may competent may put patients risk one significant reasons developed practice prescribing makes outlier prescribing medications combinations medications manner like majority practitioners prescribing pattern may frivolous unsafe case unsafe patterns practitioner receive immediate feedback necessary intervention reviews currently happen level hospitals care systems routine review physicians cases reviewed prescribing patterns observed given feedback process limited lack standardization objectivity cases may reviewed today information technology capability allow reviewing physician caseload time review often part larger process like annual review may conflicting agendas like spinning review make person look good bad administrator wants look physicians also contacted managed care organization mcos pharmaceutical benefit managers pbms letters expressing various concerns examples might patients filled one prescription antidepressants patients seeing multiple prescribers polypharmacy letters often poorly thought probably apply physician patient time letter sent seem heavier public relations technical details prescribing medications cases reviews totally inappropriate cite example reviewer notifies nursing staff patient lithium needs follow immediate blood tests upon discharge inpatient physician ordered appropriate tests recent records spoken physician know testing done another relevant question pharmacosurveillance owns data managed care company i aware treats patient data proprietary data whether know i gave previous example blog asking managed care executive permission use deidentified brain images teaching purposes told would want use data despite defined teaching purpose institution long history medicine teaching available abnormal findings purpose developing better diagnosticians prescription pharmacy data even clandestine history physicians aware recently prescription data collected pharmacies everywhere company called ims america information used primarily pharmaceutical company sales forces monitor products prescribed whether detailing people impact prescriptions individual physician able see records look trends prescribing data time data collection centralized purpose selling collected data pharmaceutical companies past years buried clinic hospital electronic health records best physician could would request prescribing data particular patient pharmacy might result faxed pages lines lines prescriptions usually encompassing recent years state may claim data set place mandatory rules practitioners collect data transmit state minnesota practitioners treating depression mandated patient complete phq rating scales depression results sent state state also monitors prescribing data stimulant prescriptions children mandates person taking antipsychotic medication needs sign written consent form currently states participate prescription drug monitoring programs pdmps track drugs classified controlled substances schedules ii iv pdmp programs originally set help law enforcement identify illegal activities controlled substances developed resource physicians wanted know patient getting multiple prescriptions prescriptions increased risk medications might prescribing pre existing systems led cdc fda develop prescription behavior surveillance system pbss look trends prescriptions controlled substances typically pharmacies within state submit data controlled substances within week prescription filled pbss categorizes data three categories benzodiazepines stimulants opioid analgesics buprenorphine classified opioid analgesic category even though primary use treating opioid dependent patients tramadol included database reclassified also miscellaneous category includes zolpidem carisoprodol i think probably makes sense include gaba enhancing sedative hypnotics like zolpidem zaleplon eszopiclone benzodiazepine category preliminary data pbss system released october interesting terms representative sample eight states reported cover population represent census bureau regions prescription rates calculated prescription rate per residents given recent census data perhaps surprising rate opioid prescribing approaches nearly one prescription every state resident states states rate opioid prescribing twice high rate benzodiazepine stimulant prescribing two four fold differences state state prescribing controlled substances across board top opioid prescribers delaware wrote one four opioid prescriptions state top decile prescribers account opioid prescribing decile solely account state state differences specialists pain clinics pain medicine surgery physical medicine likely write prescriptions per day thought account opioid prescriptions per day authors suggest prescriptions category written general practitioners family medicine internal medicine midlevel practitioners overlapping prescriptions benzodiazepines opioids long acting short acting opioids common multiple provider episodes mpes defined resident filling controlled substance prescription prescribers pharmacies month period varied significantly state age number controlled substance schedules added totals ranged low residents louisiana ohio overall first impression system limitation clearly provides valuable information prescribing behavior relevant controlled substances current epidemic accidental overdose deaths driving force pbss system shows pharmacosurveillance system possible limitations data quality inputted pharmacies needs quality control measures assure consistency ideal system would also include diagnosis indication physician speciality would also useful marker i think best use system like would allow physicians mine prescription data see compare physicians general within speciality specific strategies could developed self correction earliest possible stages i wrote pharmacosurveillance system used wales previous post top drugs causing complications system opioids antibiotics warfarin heparin insulin order sophisticated system would possible pick significant adverse drug events monitor events well talk patient safety days really patient safety practiced silos health care businesses hospitals clinics places individual health care data considered proprietary least complication big enough state authorities mandate reported investigation businesses inherent conflict interest reporting adverse drugs events severe complications pharmacosurveillance across entire health care landscape depend reports complications made businesses effect protected patient privacy complications actively sought investigated time prescription suddenly stops changes data also needs freely available physicians look prescribing data relative peers make changes necessary time view process way learn provide safest
