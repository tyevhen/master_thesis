order bring clarity discussion neuroscience important psychiatrists i thought i would get back basics i three models graphic i think represent basic conceptualizations brain lifetime basic models i think reasonable jumping points discussion also serve make point importance neuroscience i realize natural human tendency argumentative i mention neuroscience even science seems many psychiatrists interestingly detractors get irritated i understand detractors irritated since many level black box thinking diagram i elaborate many seem consider brain amalgam various qualities either defy understanding unnecessary understand brain may involved periphery human behavior i understand attitude part brain professionals like psychiatrists doubt importance neuroscience let me proceed three levels thought brain diagram black box embodies people thought brain since beginning time brain mystery one hand immutable reality situation could denied long obvious people clear brain damage survived initial insult could number changes cognition personality social behavior black box view eventually gave way mind body dualism held number mental phenomenon could explained physical properties alone really last refuge black box conscious human state explained terms arises neural correlates consciousness active area research clear box area today always interesting terms adheres black box thinking days i ca think legitimate science occurs using model pre modern modern neuroscience anything clearly dispelled black box mind body duality philosophers antipsychiatrists level grey box box things got clearer transition black grey clear well defined boundary best example i think german neuropsychiatry beginning th century much movement focused asylums famous picture giants field like kraepelin alzheimer nissl binswanger others active time psychiatrists made good phenomenological observations also focused gross neuroanatomy case illnesses like alzheimer disease observations could made autopsy case schizophrenia bipolar disorder gross anatomical changes evident although negative finding finding propelled century sophisticated neuroanatomy neurophysiology beginnings much sophisticated molecular biological approach functional mental illnesses illnesses gross anatomical physiological markers neuroscience moving forward slow pace slight progress fronts diagnosis treatment dsm always controversial document largely never shortage self proclaimed experts psychiatry psychiatrists know limitations tested physical illnesses important rule states cause drug alcohol intoxication chronic use withdrawal medical intoxicant induced states clear medical illnesses definition well associated syndromes disclaimer dsm using training required conduct appropriate evaluations make appropriate diagnosis training required assure patients safely treated associated medical conditions need recognized diagnosed came result medical focus reemphasized advent dsm prior overemphasis psychoanalysis psychodynamic psychotherapy darker grey box consisted brain full psychoanalytic constructs diagnosis treatment overly dependent model dsm technology required step refocusing psychiatry medicine brain organ occurred years ago time psychiatrists diagnoses treat people based clinical experience general patterns recognize course training practice cases dsm clear criteria helpful like definition manic episode cases like difference anxiety depression problems patients endorse predominately anxious symptoms one week predominately depressive symptoms next severity illness typically lead clearer diagnosis likely due fact boundary clinical case normal arbitrarily defined impairment functioning impairment lead clearer diagnosis better markers classify illness hopefully predict treatment response needed search markers active area investigation psychiatry remain grey box without markers clear cut treatments address underlying biological changes lot pharmacological research done dsm era lot discussion neurotransmitter receptor pharmacology implications scientific treatment like science receptor pharmacology post synaptic cell signalling mechanisms stand still many theories receptor drug pharmacology stood test time focus pathological nobody could hope drugs often accidentally discovered would lead highly effective treatments comprehensive theory mental illness normal brain function clinical trials psychiatric drugs studies pharmacology physiology also limited research subject heterogeneity problem research complex polygenic illness case pure mental illness medical cause ruled dsm criteria alone poor filter selecting homogeneous populations research drug psychotherapy research grey box suffered treatments applied heterogeneous populations researcher i know thinks two people dsm diagnosis similar point drug medication response would high necessarily reproducible apart diagnostic problem dsm suggests homogeneity context seasoned clinician knows differently clear box goal knowledge needed get box much comprehensive recognizes brain complexity importance conscious state rather collection dsm descriptors despite fact many basic mechanisms elucidated years ago neuroscience detractors like psychiatry common strategy neuroscience detractors take either research finding media quote debunk fanfare popular media ulterior motives often suggested connecting neuroscience primarily psychiatric disorders many detractors depend characterization original research cultural phenomenon piling negative criticism score appears victory vocal like minded use strategy claiming mental illness addictions diseases like real diseases despite fact general population considers equivalent i find nothing compelling critiques ongoing science medicine unqualified main problem people truly qualified produce criticism ignored favor amounts unscientific criticism secondary problem proliferation journals especially opinion pieces rather scientific papers another interesting thought i clear box many people difficulty recognizing machine intelligence improving point might exceed human intelligence seem problem figuring whether computer may negotiated turing test seem indistinguishable another human many people seem difficulty recognizing computational capacity human brain result complexity despite philosophical arguments possible reason seeing clear box preferred state brain knowledge i tried point many times one key element mischaracterization neuroscience psychiatry basic lack understanding science science process dialogue medical science process dialogue physical science processes involved complicated experiments involve proportionally fewer relevant variables differential equations based variables explain brain works entire blocks research end partially true dead end mean grand conspiracy means time move new paradigm george dawson md dfapa quotation credit
