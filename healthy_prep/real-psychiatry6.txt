clozapine sulpride aripiprazole quetiapine showed efficacy preventing hosptializations benzodiazepines incident cohort survival bias eliminated lithium effect decreased rehospitalizations robust suggesting effect size valid total cohort also secondary mortality assessment showed lithium antidepressants associated decreased overall mortality difference observed antipsychotics authors recognize significant adverse effects limitations use lithium point also possible advantages outside treatment mood disorders significant burden associated taking recommend considered maintenance broader group patients unipolar depression antidepressant centric society i agree conclusion effects study really ignored lithium augmentation antidepressants around years surfaced star protocol i see patients exclusively treated physicians prescribers past years i seen exactly patient unipolar depression treated lithium augmentation far common see patient taking antidepressants typically ssri bupropion trazodone mirtazapine antidepressant plus lamotrigine augmentation strategy similar study cohort american patients would useful look questions efficacy lithium versus antidepressant polypharmacy lamotrigine concern would would large enough sample patients taking lithium may clinicians used lithium therapy application unipolar depression reintroduce practice collect data outcomes relative standard antidepressant augmentation strategies overall study group pharmacoepidemiologists provides compelling data take second look old strategy instead adding antidepressants data looks good lithium inexpensive usa absolute vacuum lithium non use unipolar depression inpatient treatment depression become atrocious never important help people stay hospital i considered important paper
