stuff sets me fire i think herein lies secrets imprinting therapy take probably little different direction anybody else i really need get seen critical eyes first i think imprinting epigenetic process involves methylation histone modifications process responsible variety diseases cancer fragile syndrome mental retardation angelman syndrome mental illness say causes process begin least i found article sent also states methylation process plays role gene expression could include hormone set points cortisol production like i think research pretty well supported fact almost emotional illness traced imprint indicating trauma selectively initiate methylation process also demonstrated dysregulated systems reregulate also phillips article states cases methylation dna fairly long term stable conversion cases germ cells silencing imprinted genes must reversed demethylation take place allow epigenetic reprogramming perhaps germ cells exclusive interests me i think primal therapy also i long felt enough attention given physiology crying even frye work meager powerful apparatus humans animal i think crying demethylation system something close i use metaphor water hose say crying demethylation tool dirty car way methylation wrought trauma stand swing hose around want car get clean happens mock primal therapies help clear way hose address every aspect car order wash properly primal therapy start feeling help patient stay track st line i know nothing therapeutic happens without crying least me even tho crying involved st line takes me also explains must relive entire experience activate every aspect system involved trauma thorough demethylation entire imprint gives rise defense epigenetic reprogramming normalize system also little article i found linking adrenal fatigue dna methylation cortisol plays big role neurosis i thought might trigger worthwhile thoughts me confirms notion connection methylation stress trauma even tho i sure works link adrenal fatigue dna methylation link adrenal fatigue dna methylation published townsend letter doctors patients may editor adrenal function vital life without cortisol die fact known since described banting best glucocorticords essential maintaining carbohydrate protein fat metabolism also permissive effect allows glucagon catecholamines work important glucocorticoid effects include normal functioning nervous system water metabolism vascular reactivity regulation circulating lymphocytes immune system resistance stress complete lack ofadrenal function disease state known addison disease autoimmune disease usually caused antibodies attack adrenal gland conventional medicine recognizes two states either make cortisol allopathic physicians unaware decline adrenal function illness becomes chronic etiology adrenal fatigue begins stressor functional medicine terms trigger triggers fall several categories psychosocial stress environmental toxins radon mercury mold infectious organisms fungal bacterial parasitic food allergies wheat corn sugar milk toxins alcohol drugs prescription medications name addition stressful events surgery car accidents place huge usually unrecognized load adrenal glands initial response events elevate cortisol levels help cope stress however time adrenals become weakened lose circadian rhythm due large part poor nutrition stressful events require increased amounts several nutrients vitamin pantothenic acid pyridoxine bmethylcobalamin folate interestingly adrenal glands catheterized stressor introduced first chemical leave adrenals cortisol one would suspect large amounts vitamin nutrients severely lacking typical american diet found high enough amounts often orthomolecular dosing necessary correct deficits initial response stress hypersecretion cortisol time approximately one year develops negative feedback genuine fatigue causing reduced levels dhea cortisol end result organism reduced immunity increased likelihood autoimmune disease heart attacks elevated cholesterol triglycerides skin disorders carbohydrate cravings protein wasting fatigue depression name physicians normally view separate events given organ see symptoms represent disease process inflammation may occur one organs simultaneously therefore everyone chronic disease cardiovascular disease screened using dhea homocysteine level dhea decreases level homocysteine rises concomitant decrease vitamins especially folate currently accepted norms parameters permissive reminiscent glucose control years gone organs linked nothing happens random result genetic interaction environment establishment disease another pivotal biochemical event happens abnornal methyl groups nosedives well patients may present symptoms depression inability synthesize adenosylmethionine joint pain inability make methylsulfonylmethionine name teh abiltiy convert methylated product also compromised example chronically ill individuals sue either cyanocobalamin hydroxocobalamin form seems little improve fatigue mental functioning ideal compound replenish methylcobalamin active form case oral supplementation missing methyl containing substrate ameliorates symptoms scenarios listed severity illness correlates level reduced deficient dhea concomitant elevated homocysteine level elevated homocysteine level marker inflammation marker deficient vitamins well stage set abnormal dna methylation induction cancer efforts repair adrenal fatigure include nutrients active form glandular preparations dhea severe cases cortisol lifestyle modifications removal triggers even measures
