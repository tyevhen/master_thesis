blog post i would like discuss clinical use five elements particular cosmological sequence cosmological sequence term chinese one i mean arrangement five elements cross like fashion rather circular arrangement sheng ke cycles familiar every practitoner student chinese medicine cosmological sequence water bottom fire top wood left metal right earth centre associated compass directions south fire top north water bottom east wood left west metal right direction earth centre earth compass direction centre point reference translation although translation wu xing phases gained acceptance without problems many sinologists reject wu xing could translated goings conducts movements forces agents entities activities stages john major argues phases friedrich lackner suggest restoring elements bodde favours elements phases graham uses processes indeed elements different names chinese times various times various texts names used wu cai ability talent aptitude wu de power potency wu wei place location status condition first origin theory elements dates back warring states period bc even much earlier think even shang dynasty take directions si fang plus centre precursor theory elements i personally think ancient four directions shang dynasty precursors five elements please note diagram south top plan ritual complex built emperor wang mang ad reconstruction ming tang antiquity shang dynasty theory directions plus centre prevailed obviously similar scheme elements correspondence seasons directions important feature elements introduced necessary centre earth element connection directions early elements confirms earliest arrangement elements cross form circular one sheng cycle centre theory elements greatly developed zou yan bc school philosophy called yin yang school yin yang jia included elements needham calls school naturalist school considers proto science opposed pseudo science confucianists ancient times elements wu xing called wu cai i materials could also abilities talents zou yan introduced term wu xing cycles among generating sheng controlling ke one earliest references elements describes terms movements note order therefore numbers water soaks descends fire blazes ascends wood bent straightened metal moulded changed earth allows sowing harvesting take notice order elements listed get numbers add number number change get element numbers part system correspondences confucian philosopher dong zhong shu bc elaborated elements mentions sheng cycle notice numbers would different cross like arrangement heaven elements first wood second fire third earth fourth metal fifth water wood comes first water comes last earth middle order heaven made wood produces fire fire produces earth earth produces metal metal produces water water produces wood father son relationship wood dwells left metal right fire front water behind earth centre transmitters fathers receivers sons unvarying dependence son fathers direction fathers sons dao heaven course confucian ethical interpretation elements i would say alien medicine notice reference dao dao confucian much daoist ideal theory directions elements cultural phenomena also political overtones introduction centre directions even elements chance coincides political development strong central ruler called huang di theory directions prevailed shang zhou dynasty bc characterized centre reflected political structure shang zhou states characterized strong ruler mandate heaven tian ming central authority collapsed fifth century rise several states fighting without strong central ruler chance shifting flowing cycles elements appeared warring states period theory dynastic transmission based elements elaborated zou yan envisaged dynasty transmission linked reverse ke i insulting cycle elements words dynasty followed one pertaining element controlling element previous dynasty example dynasty pertaining fire would succeeded one pertaining water overcomes fire put differently dynasty pertaining fire succeeded one pertaining element fire could conquer insulting cycle i water onset dynasty would preceded omens heralding ascension particular dynasty following table lists opens

confucianists accordance number powers seen close interaction theoretical cosmology political power ancient china chance theory elements developed warring states periods onwards consolidated qin han dynasty emerging political forces transitional period mobilized correlative cosmologies wu xing particular destroy centrality old hegemonic state construct new power relations imperial era using wu xing cosmology transformed static cosmology si fang four directions replacing notion eternal centre surrounding four quarters five dynamically interacting cosmic phases conquering generating one another sequential order besides used destroy old cosmology political order wu xing cosmology functioned political discourse imperial era used diverse factions power contesting imperial sovereignty defining norms political behavior constructing emperorship power relations evolved around theory elements many facets also depend different ways arranged cosmological cycle generating cycle controlling cycle insulting cycle example one context theory elements used represent physical order conquering forces nature controlling cycle another context used depict moral order birth nurturing generating cycle first qin emperor theory elements cosmology conquest violence replaced moral intentionality heaven han confucian scholars theory elements moral cosmology manifesting intention heaven wang cosmology political culture early china cambridge university press cambridge warring states period marked disintegration authority central ruler authority political also religious ruler connection heaven earth god like status ruler power taken four social groups established philosophical schools simply social groups religious nature experts like modern scientists state bureaucracy military class established philosophical schools confucian mo zi daoists legalists class religious natural experts assortment diviners ritualists astrologers musicians physicians calendar experts etc theories yin yang elements developed group people professions experts started build various correlative classifications natural order human world based numerological sets etc applying correlative categories specialities serving patrons replaced king monopoly communication divine innovation direct correlation heaven earth person theory elements used experts curry favour various rulers use theory give legitimacy ruler reign dynasty example first chinese emperor defined pertaining water saying time water cycle five elements book poetry describes onset reason qin dynasty first emperor qin unified heaven proclaimed emperor someone advised saying huang di received power de earth yellow dragon earth worm appeared xia received power wood green dragon stopped city gates grass trees luxuriant shang received power metal silver flowed mountains zhou received power fire red birds appeared omen qin replaced zhou time power water come zou yan said whenever sovereign going rise heaven certainly show favourable omens people advance five elements nei jing elements mentioned many chapters su wen ling shu common correspondences elements following colours odors directions organs seasons flavours numbers orifices numerology used many instances classify things stagnations fullnesses deficiencies chapter su wen east direction greenish colour entered communicates liver orifice opens eye stores essence liver flavour sour class herbs trees animal chicken grain wheat tone jue number odor rancid chapter su wen east generates wind wind generates wood wood generates sour flavour sour flavour generates liver liver generates sinews sinews generates heart liver rules eyes among zang liver among colour greenish among tone jue among voices shouting among orifices eyes among flavours sour among emotions anger clinical application element cosmological cycle arrangement element cross important clinical applications vertical connection water fire three clinical applications kidneys heart oppose ke cycle also mutually nourish communicate three areas menstruation mental emotional sphere zhi shen sexual life earth centre manifestation importance stomach spleen make post natal blood wood left metal right manifestation balance liver lungs liver left ascends lungs right descends cosmological sequence menstruation cosmological sequence vertical connection water fire communicate

heart sexual life ren guanyuan ki qixue tongli ren jiuwei generating sheng controlling ke cycles elements nei jing contains many references cycles elements confirms arrangement away cross like arrangement earlier times according directions example controlling cycle mentioned frequently relation flavours excessive consumption example one consumes large amounts pungent foods sinews become tight nail wither metal pungent overcomes wood sinews nails chapter su wen describes controlling cycle directly wood meets metal felled fire meets water extinguished earth meets wood penetrated metal meets fire destroyed water meets earth interrupted generating controlling cycles elements also mentioned frequently describe progression disease chapter su wen says liver receives heart transmits spleen rests kidneys death occurs reaches lungs
