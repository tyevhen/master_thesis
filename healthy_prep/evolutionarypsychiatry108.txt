little bit information post get handle things open lines questions vein head i hold electric guest right click open new tab oh sure look initial post short thyroid primer ts ts tshs i little trouble nailing consistent reports literature seasonal hormonal variation papers old often studies awfully small i also trying get handle variations thyroid hormones within menstrual cycle might invalidate results women studies controlled stage menstrual cycle i sure important however i ca find consistent recommendations measure tsh particular time menstrual cycle estrogen increase amount thyroid binding globulin tend bind thyroid function especially newest studies use far accurate hormonal assays look results say keep eye new studies one better papers american journal clinical nutrition seasonal variation plasma glucose hormone levels adult men women according papers linking one results seem fairly consistent several different studies normal controls folks seasonal depression short fasting glucose levels lowest spring summer highest fall winter accordingly diagnoses new cases type ii diabetes fall winter fasting insulin also significantly lower spring fall among thyroid hormones people normal levels seasons significant differences levels season season levels also seemed differ sex measurements taken morning overnight fast total highest summer free highest summer fall lowest spring men higher levels women fall winter women higher levels men summer total highest winter negative correlation glucose free significant positive correlation amount carbohydrate sugar consumed major differences eating across seasons increase sugar intake among men spring lower fiber intake men fall women winter interesting thing study untreated men women depression differences thyroid hormones across seasons though measure people across seasons would pass irb merely follow depressed people year without trying treat somehow mean well let start going becomes made released thyroid though humans release times much thyroid addition enzymes called deiodinases change body mechanism major one active thyroid hormone made deiodinases little pocket selenium molecule transformations occur iron also required along way make thyroid hormone three types deiodinases live plasma outer membrane cells within endoplasmic reticulum within cell therefore creates active thyroid hormone much closer nucleus cell thyroid hormones exert effects important deiodinase nerves brain short half life minutes expression tightly controlled high levels reverse downregulate also important go levels regulate amount tsh secretion anterior pituitary i know endocrinology like understanding bit like card counter vegas hand longer half lives seem responsible serum blood circulating levels thyroid hormones makes though also inactivate preferentially inactivates making reverse times iodine shortage hypothyroidism brain decrease activity increasing activity leaves around lot longer protect brain iodine deficiency pretty cool rats made iodine deficient serum tissue become almost unmeasureable brain levels decreased quick recap solidify facts brain make active makes inactive reverse found within cell near nuclear action surface cells systemically levels remain pretty stable throughout body intracellularly depending actions much higher liver kidneys without much normal physiologic levels occupies nuclear thyroid hormone receptors trs central nervous system lot nuclear thyroid hormone receptor occupancy close also found brown fat helps regulate body temperature room temperature around trs occupied thyroid hormone cold trs occupied heat generated brown fat part uncoupling protein ucp made response also seems increase activity fat burning enzymes response cold important however know animal studies serum levels relatively unchanged whether cold room temperature action seemed happening intracellularly tissue specific metabolic effects affecting levels within cells changes within cells may also explain changes basal metabolic rate response different diets high carbohydrate diets context eating much example may increase activity humans may brown fat previously thought also might activity skeletal muscle previously thought thyroid hormone one truly potent stimulators metabolic rate findings elucidate elegant system wherein individual cells tissues respond relatively wide variations normal serum levels also shows preserve thyroid hormone function times iodine shortage hand hard interpret small variations thyroid hormone function serum levels may little going within cell action certainly cases severe iodine deficiency thyroid disease pituitary disease see large predictable changes hormone levels decipher meaning see affect physiology body much smaller seasonal nonthyroidal euthyroid sick syndrome changes much trickier make significant seasonal differences serum thyroid hormone levels folks seasonal depression normal mild variation healthy people difference higher perhaps makes survive winter smile i know know critically ill patients tissue expression increased thus reducing increasing reverse fasting continuous administration trh reverse dropping levels suggesting perhaps central hypothalamic mechanism reduced trh response fasting reversed leptin feeding may important peripheral mechanism got heh consistent changes summer winter thyroid hormone activity disease state seasonal depression changes dependent carbohydrate intake though increasing carbohydrate increase active thyroid hormone fasting decrease one thinks abundant summer lean winter perhaps increases winter meant compensate would compensate diet presumably lower carbohydrate plant matter winter would matter humans evolved time near equator much study thyroid hormone done reptiles thyroid hormone important stages metamorphasis reptilian development seasonal changes remnants even earlier evolutionary signals i think i breadth knowledge properly contemplate questions i keep looking
