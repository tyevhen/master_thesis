i found short article today thought readers might also find interesting good job explaining kennedy disease well research currently underway determine igf viable treatment click title go article delaying motor neurone disease blocking production faulty protein mice researchers delayed onset motor neurone disease improved mobility extended life span motor neurone diseases affect cells control movement types 'sporadic genetic spinal bulbar muscular atrophy sbma also known kennedy disease genetic caused mutation chromosome disease fully affects males previous research showed sbma caused mutation androgen receptor mutation produces faulty protein accumulates body causing damage motor neurons leading muscle weakness wasting past team proved akt cell signalling protein able increase clearance faulty protein study found insulin like growth factor igf activates protein test tube see true animals bred sbma mice expressed high levels growth factor skeletal muscles mice showed increased clearance faulty protein therefore reduced accumulation tissue importantly mice also better mobility put weight lived longer disease currently untreatable step forward understanding affects body molecular level may treated
