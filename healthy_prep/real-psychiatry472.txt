i received mail two weeks ago asked suggestions immediately reforming residency programs psychiatry i experience completing residency two different university based programs residency occurred height controversy self described biological psychiatrists psychotherapists psychoanalysts although i never seen written open animosity groups times biological psychiatrist back day might make statement like i talk therapy psychotherapy oriented psychiatrist might refer biological types dial twisters referring approach suggested excessive biological reductionism apparently neither group read kandel seminal article new england journal medicine four years earlier plasticity affected talking medications course experiences several years ago i attended anniversary university wisconsin department psychiatry program i eventually completed residency thomas insel md one invited speakers outlined revolutionary approach educating psychiatry residents involved joint year neuroscience internship residents neurology neurosurgery provide details i sent follow mail two years later said would probably happen watch i easily build theme i think two year program focused basic clinical neuroscience remains good approach current approach getting relevant information haphazard best depends lectures neuroscience interspersed clinical rotations varying quality large extent depends faculty many faculty many expected produce managed care style billings productivity rather high quality teaching comprehensive integrated approach teach state art neuroscience provide relevant training neurology medicine possible many obvious areas improvement residents often spend time clinical rotations minimal relevance psychiatrists i recall learning icu medicine needing familiarize myself various tasks swan ganz catheters central lines ventilator settings dopamine drips balloon pumps i would never use i needed seeing hundreds people heart disease arrhythmias hypertension diabetes endocrine disorders neurological disorders i saw many people hospitalized seeing folks ambulatory care settings designed enhance learning experience psychiatrist would provide better experience process probably start earlier fourth year medical school prospective psychiatrists focused electives neurology medicine neurosurgery rather psychiatry teaching psychiatry needs address practical concerns diagnosis treatment also philosophical concerns residents need familiar antipsychiatry philosophy existing literature refutes residents need know issue validity reliability psychiatric diagnoses established actually rich history came could easily summarized one seminar one features i interested i interviewing residency positions whether program supplied reading list surprisingly subject area would good example required reading necessary bring prospective resident speed good model illustrate difference neuroscience based approach opposed symptoms based approach american society addiction medicine asam definition addiction web site unlike dsm collection symptoms designed pick group statistical outliers asam definition correlates known addictive behaviors brain substrates systems standard texts field lowinson ruiz asam text ries feillin miller saitz chock full neuroscience applies addiction i teach lectures i generally talking medications work addiction level also psychological social factors work level neurobiology i seen dsm time i think time move past defining every possible substance abuse associated syndrome incorporating neuroscience especially neuroscience case around years residency programs need teach level detail psychiatrists need maintain superior communication skills relative physicians means getting good basic experience interviewing psychotherapy techniques time psychiatrist future needs able order interpret tests including ecgs mri scans wide skill base taxes every faculty except largest academic departments internet age really reason every residency program access standardized powerpoints lectures didactic material ascp model psychopharmacology program excellent example possible i would go step beyond say culture within organized psychiatry every psychiatrist access material establishing culture everyone trainees practicing psychiatrists alike speed competent across broad array topics psychiatrists need familiar proven approach rarely used medical education psychiatry also needs focused old school quality kind quality depends customer satisfaction survey issues diagnostic assessment appropriate prescribing top list make sure every person consulting psychiatrist gets high quality evaluation treatment plan plan dictated managed care company university wisconsin paradigm networking physicians collaborative memory clinics program i see reason could extended different diagnostic groups across state focus would quality assessment prevent outliers terms treatment could open psychiatrist wanted join could additional benefits providing university resources like online access medical library clinicians field interested excited technically competent psychiatrist ultimate goal residency continue throughout career psychiatrist happen focus professionalism levels definition professionalism include managing costs managed care organization make money psychiatrists need forget cost effective get back defining providing best
