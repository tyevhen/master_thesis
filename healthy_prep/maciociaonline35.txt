obviously theory autoimmune diseases chinese medicine however analyzing nature autoimmunity chinese correspondent immune system i shall call defence system formulate certain theories opinion autoimmunity implies seven aspects chinese perspective set apart immunity problems allergy infection origin derangement defence system deeper diseases onset pathogenic factor autoimmune diseases insidious chinese word would often lurking defence system derangement rooted yin aspect jing marrow kidneys kidney deficiency root autoimmunity autoimmune diseases complex pathology equate inflammation heat aetiology autoimmune diseases different ordinary chinese aetiology looking seven aspects i would like summarize possible types pathology immune system chinese interpretation premise stages levels seen patterns disharmony immune system proceeding i define zheng zheng translated correct upright i translate zheng upright note ethical apart medical implication term healthy correct upright term zheng reveals confucian influence chinese medicine upright correct implies application confucian quality yi i appropriateness conduct appropriate every situation course appropriate according confucian ethics thus zheng appropriate medical point view also ethical one practical terms zheng general term types play role defence pathogenic factors therefore immune response specific type gu example collective term indicate types play role immune response terms zheng often used opposition xie i pathogenic factor literally evil types immune system pathology chinese equivalent stages levels following interpretation dysfunctions immune system perspective stages levels invasion exterior pathogenic factor exterior level firstly acute bacterial viral infection course big part chinese medicine invasion exterior pathogenic factor causes acute symptoms described stages shang han lun levels ye tian shi wen bing school systems beginning stage i tai yang stage stages wei level levels definition acute symptoms stage especially fever indicate zheng reacting pathogenic factor good thing zheng reacting pathogenic factor biomedical perspective immune system fighting virus bacteria normal healthy reaction aim ideally expel pathogenic factor exterior stage possible definitely expel clear drain level exterior pathogenic factor penetrating interior exterior pathogenic factor penetrates interior changes heat stage interior heat either yang ming stage stages one level patterns stage fever higher still good indicates zheng immune system reacting pathogenic factor infection western sense two stages exterior one interior heat one normal developments pathology invasion pathogenic factor yin stage immune deficiency another pathology immune system immune deficiency seen hiv chinese perspective serious total deficiency zheng aspects i would add also immune deficiency leads cancer chinese theory cancer focuses solid tumours cancers due accumulation blood accumulation occur without underlying deficiency zheng zheng healthy circulates well blood accumulate stagnate cancer develop borne western biomedicine know cancers cells formed time healthy individuals neutralized immune system every day chinese perspective i assimilate three yin stages stages ying blood levels levels i saying describe pathological changes cancer seen paradigm pathology cancer context immune system relative immune deficiency new type immune deficiency recognized root chronic fatigue syndrome cfs cfs patient immune system reacting enough leads chronicity disease go years without patient getting better worse recognized pathology immune system recently previously thought either immune system working patient get better case hiv chinese perspective cfs patient improve simultaneous deficiency zheng pathogenic factor usually dampness reference stages levels cfs often presents shao yang pattern stages gall bladder heat pattern levels almost shao yang pattern patient getting better course disease chronic pathogenic factor stuck shao yang energetic layer bounces yang ming stage causing feeling heat tao yang stage causing feeling cold hence alternation feeling hot feeling cold hyper reactivity immune system allergy allergy immune system hyper reactive i reacts allergens normal immune system would react seen allergic asthma allergic rhinitis atopic eczema leaving eczema aside allergic hyper reaction assimilated tai yang stage stages wei level levels clear case allergic rhinitis symptoms mimic invasion wind sneezing runny nose headache thus could argue tai yang stage wei level describe symptoms acute invasion wind also respiratory allergy following table summarizes types immune system dysfunction last one autoimmunity discussed immune reaction disease stages levels acute viral infection exterior invasion wind acute influenza tai yang wei level good reaction immune system external attack acute disease bronchitis yang ming level reacting hiv cancer tai yin jue yin shao yin ying blood level reacting enough chronic fatigue syndrome shao yang stage gb heat level hyper reactivity allergy allergic asthma allergic rhinitis atopic eczema tai yang stage wei level autoimmunity latent heat yin fire auto immunity finally autoimmunity another possible pathology immune system western medicine let look seven aspects autoimmunity chinese perspective detail know autoimmune diseases total breakdown body immune system fails recognize body self normal immune system attacks foreign body origin derangement defence system deeper diseases autoimmune diseases stem derangement immune system none starts symptoms exterior invasion onset clearly defined pathology complex thus zheng reacts external pathogenic factor different zheng leads autoimmune disease former healthy fights pathogenic factors latter dysfunctional type attacks body onset pathogenic factor autoimmune diseases insidious onset autoimmune diseases never like external invasion insidious chinese word used often lurking chinese term latent heat often pathology autoimmune diseases fu means hidden shall see often due development latent heat yin fire insidious character implies root often difficult see treatment difficult example external invasion wind nature pathogenic factor clear treatment relatively easy contrast autoimmune disease pathogenic factor less visible one gives often rise contradicting hot cold symptoms defence system derangement rooted yin aspect seen many components immune system chinese medicine yang yin wei yang type yuan ming men jing marrow yin types derangement defence system seen autoimmune diseases due yin yang components i jing marrow deficiency kidneys root autoimmunity deficiency kidneys opinion nearly always root autoimmune diseases please note necessarily kidney yin deficiency kidney deficiency possible manifestations i kidney yin kidney yang kidney jing one reason kidney deficiency usually root development latent heat often pathology underlying autoimmune diseases latent heat formed pathogenic factor invades body without causing acute symptoms absence acute symptoms indicates pathogenic factor invaded body zheng react healthy immune system response shall see later due kidney deficiency modern chinese doctors see pathology autoimmune diseases yin deficiency empty heat i agree view personally think pathology autoimmune disease complicated many patients autoimmune diseases suffer yang deficiency clearly shown pale tongue autoimmune diseases complex pathology autoimmune diseases complex pathology confusing contradictory symptoms signs expect consider norm rather exception underlying kidney deficiency may kidney yang deficiency would cause cold symptoms time may heat symptoms due heat damp heat rheumatoid arthritis good example joints hot touch possibly red yet yang deficiency tongue pale skin pale patient often feels cold another example hashimoto thyroiditis characterized hypothyroidism common pattern spleen kidney yang deficiency however cases yin deficiency rheumatoid arthritis inflammation joints may red swollen yet often tongue pale sj gren syndrome symptoms clearly yin deficiency often tongue show moreover many autoimmune diseases multiple pathogenic factors dampness phlegm stagnation blood stasis toxic heat equate inflammation heat autoimmune diseases inflammation plays big role pathology diseases inflammation discussed length important equate western biomedical concept inflammation chinese concept heat perfectly possible inflammation presence cold yang deficiency indeed often happens hashimoto thyroiditis rheumatoid arthritis mention two also look list anti inflammatory chinese herbs see found many different categories clearing heat indeed anti inflammatory herbs tonifying yang expelling cold categories list anti inflammatory chinese herbs given previous post autoimmune diseases th january aetiology autoimmune diseases important grasp aetiology autoimmune disease gives indication treatment chinese books always mention invasion external pathogenic factors emotional stress irregular diet etc play role triggering causative factors true example dampness aetiological factor ms millions people invaded dampness get ms must factors play factors may toxicants tobacco alcohol infectious agents radiation aetiology autoimmune disease deeper subtle insidious complex one must take account modern factors genetic aetiology autoimmune diseases answer question millions people invaded dampness get ms answer must strong genetic component might called pre heaven chinese medicine therefore must acknowledge remember treatment i must treat kidneys kidney jing immunizations aetiological factor autoimmune diseases opinion immunizations play important role aetiology autoimmune diseases impossible prove opinion experience strongly direct me briefly i believe immunizations may create latent heat i believe pathology may cases autoimmune diseases level perspective immunize child adult influenza vaccine example injected pathogenic factor vaccine whether attenuated live blood level directly bypassing three levels crucially especially wei level although immunizations supposed stimulate immune system produce antibodies passing three levels plays havoc immune system leads formation latent heat may cause many syndromes one autoimmune diseases hygiene theory autoimmune diseases think autoimmune diseases may caused lack exposure bacteria childhood modern children live much hygienic conditions past past exposed bacteria effect actually strengthening immune system nowadays children exposed many bacteria immune system becomes delicate starts reacting case autoimmune diseases reason theory called hygiene theory still theory i think lot truth previously hygiene theory explained increasing incidence allergic diseases thought also applies autoimmune diseases although different pathologies similarity two immune system reacts substances react allergens case allergic diseases body cells case autoimmune diseases inflammation inflammation feature autoimmune diseases discuss inflammation biomedicine interpretation chinese medicine inflammation normal response organism pathogens irritants inflammation often consequence infection confuse two invaded wind virus western medicine develop fever acute inflammation i infection subsequent inflammation inflammation part complex biological response vascular tissues harmful stimuli pathogens damaged cells irritants classical signs acute inflammation pain heat redness swelling loss function inflammation protective attempt organism remove injurious stimuli initiate healing process inflammation synonym infection even cases inflammation caused infection although infection caused microorganism inflammation one responses organism pathogen inflammation may become chronic play important negative role many diseases cases inflammation play positive role played acute inflammation response pathogen example allergic asthma allergic disease excessive number ige mast cells bronchi react allergens leading explosion mast cells release chemical mediators cause inflammation perpetuate broncho constriction airway hypersensitivity thickening airway wall inflammation becomes chronic patient chronic asthma chronic inflammation lead host diseases chronic inflammation known involved cardiovascular diseases cancer diabetes obesity arthritis neurological diseases pulmonary diseases autoimmune diseases know diseases caused dysregulation inflammatory pathways leading chronic inflammation interestingly aetiological factors inflammation stress toxicants tobacco alcohol infectious agents radiation i would add immunizations count infectious agents list shows modern aetiological factors different ancient chinese medicine extensive research indicated pro inflammatory genes regulated transcription factors transcription factors drivers control gene expression regulate signalling pathways dysregulation transcription factors induces chronic inflammation chronic disease many plant active ingredients shown regulate transcription factors inhibit

harmful stimuli achieved increased movement plasma leukocytes especially granulocytes blood injured tissues cascade biochemical events propagates matures inflammatory response involving local vascular system immune system various cells within injured tissue chronic inflammation leads progressive shift type cells present site inflammation characterized simultaneous destruction healing tissue inflammatory process allergic reaction known type hypersensitivity result inappropriate immune response triggering inflammation common example allergic rhinitis caused hypersensitive response skin mast cells allergens pre sensitised mast cells respond degranulating releasing vasoactive chemicals histamine chemicals propagate excessive inflammatory response characterised blood vessel dilation production pro inflammatory molecules cytokine release recruitment leukocytes hypersensitivity reactions type hemolytic anemia myasthenia gravis pernicious anemia type sle rheumatoid arthritis autoimmune glomerulonephritis mediated antibody reactions also induce inflammation attracting leukocytes damage surrounding tissue inflammation plays role also cancer inflammation orchestrates microenvironment around tumours contributing proliferation survival migration cancer cells use selectins chemokines receptors invasion migration metastasis inflammation autoimmune diseases part immune system fights pathogens acquired immune system remembers foreign antigens proteins fight come back employs lymphocytes body also innate immune system primitive employs types white blood cells granulocytes monocytes destroy harmful substances autoinflammatory diseases innate immune system causes inflammation unknown reasons reacts even though never encountered autoantibodies antigens body interesting opinion innate immune system might reacting pathogens immunizations autoinflammatory disorders characterized intense episodes inflammation result symptoms fever rash joint swelling diseases also carry risk amyloidosis potentially fatal build blood protein vital organs
