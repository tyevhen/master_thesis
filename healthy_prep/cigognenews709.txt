early nineteenth century french scientist named jean baptiste lamarck decided acquired characteristics experiences parents underwent russian communists applied agriculture matter widely discredited theory recently avowed marxist position may resurrected bit new field called epigenetics states pretty much lamarck believed evidence exactly lamarck said individuals acquire characteristics result environment characteristics passed offspring much work epigenetics diet mother diet influences offspring physiology epigenetics genes regulated influenced experience baby i believe fetus resides womb experience influenced forevermore mother diet also moods anxiety depression genetic switch delayed premature happen without making radical change gene rather expressed whether shut discussing mother interaction environment pass offspring i think need understand fetus womb always trying adapt environment genes evolve expressed depends adaptation example mother anxious depleted much serotonin supplies fulfill young fetal need serotonin supplies may well grow deficient inhibitory repressive capacity anxiety case forevermore evolves attention deficit youth continued inability cohesive cognitive ability i think extremely important occurs fetal brain rapidly developing needs proper input evolve normally anxious mother agitated neuronal input baby carrying extreme adapt integrate input thereafter kind person accept much stimulation internal input great anything outside two terms papers overwhelming i discussed work michael meaney mcgill university worked mice found early neglect mother results lifelong alterations thirteen men committed suicide suffered child abuse epigenetic effects abuse many forms me deleterious abuse mother smokes drinks takes drugs pregnancy abuse means adversely affect child development meaney found changes thirty five people suffered schizophrenia several genes involved unfurling key neurotransmitters ordinarily help repress pain noxious stimuli affected new work related epigenetics occurrence cancer called effects epigenetic settings i call changing set points many biologic states includes set points neurotransmitters ill later make chronically comfortable uncomfortable feeling good skin one way state new experiences mother affects sperm offspring may affect grandchildren develop may smoking drug taking embryo forming later affect sperm production meaning happens womb organism getting organized affect baby lifetime important neglect period attempt understand treat emotional problems remote imprint widespread later effects opinion carrying mother stress stress hormone level high levels remain high long time immune system compromised might well affect immune status offspring i note elsewhere strong immune system natural killer cells needed stay lookout newly developing cancer cells deficient immune system lead cancer weak maternal immune system impart strong immune capability baby dislocated physiology mother also affect fetus setting stage later catastrophic disease womb life largely neglected psychological literature time reorient small feet small breasts cancer small feet small breasts desireable good bad serious neither good bad whether size arrived genetic destination due heredity size fulfilled genetic intention serious repercussions means me leave arena strict science repression interceded slow inhibit growth i know patients reported foot growth chest growth breast growth kinds growth year therapy letter former patient reported foot growth several sizes therapy happened therapy lifting repression liberating pain reason backward might say repression probibited proper growth taking place means me constant pressure key sites growth genetic destinations mean possibility serious illness possibly cancer pressure cells stop unfolding enormous one seen liberation pain difficult comprehend say one breasts small see grow result liberation i believe happen patient arrives deeply implanted

good gestation birth infancy failing relive key pains set undo massive repression writing imprint i note one way know early imprinted pain endures many entering patients high stress hormone levels normalize one year therapy may mean imprint endures constant danger must fought danger signaled high cortisol stress hormone levels levels come normal time imprint longer force simply memory force pain felt integrated though reliving memory find changes imprint way memory held engraved various changes stress hormone levels danger longer evidence system relax battle systems normalize means longer irrevocable memory deal imprint total physiologic event longer exists become neurotic way harmful memory gone often change secondary changes already evidence due damage inflicted beforehand
