latent heat latent pathogenic factor pathology quite unique rather difficult comprehend essentially latent heat formed exterior pathogenic factor invades body without causing symptoms acute stage pathogenic factor goes interior changes heat emerges later form interior heat i said latent heat unique difficult comprehend pathogenic factor invades body without causing immediate symptoms know happened i shall try answer question others progress discussion therefore two types attacks exterior pathogenic factors new attack wind heat acute onset obvious symptoms attack latent heat acute stage symptoms distinction based different aetiology different clinical manifestations beginning stage wind heat pathogenic factor attacks body acute onset frank clinical manifestations latent heat pathogenic factor invades body insidious manner without acute onset symptoms becoming latent interior emerges causing symptoms called latent heat concept pathogenic factor may invade body without causing acute symptoms time causing symptoms following season old found nei jing earliest statements concerning latent pathogenic factor su wen chapters chapter says attack wind spring lead diarrhoea summer pathogenic factor lingers attack summer heat summer lead malaria autumn attack dampness autumn cause cough winter wei syndrome attack cold winter cause wen bing spring chapter says attack cold winter lead wen bing spring attack wind spring lead diarrhoea summer attack summer heat summer cause malaria autumn attack dampness autumn cause cough winter distinction new attack latent attack heat based onset disease immediate delayed also different substance clinical manifestations clinical significance therefore timing onset clinical manifestations also different syndrome seriousness therefore treatment generally new attack comparatively light beginning pathogenic factor exterior affects lungs fever aversion cold headache cough etc treated releasing exterior stimulating diffusing descending latent attack comparatively serious heat interior beginning fever thirst restlessness etc i symptoms interior heat aversion cold unless concomitant new attack treated clearing interior heat latent heat due attack pathogenic factor body weak condition particular development latent heat due kidney deficiency due connection kidney wei system immune defences notice nei jing says invasion cold winter cause wen bing disease spring wen bing refers diseases due wind heat times nei jing shang han lun pathology exterior diseases always due cold therefore even diseases clearly started heat symptoms wind heat deemed transformation cold invading winter took centuries theory wen bing diseases became independent theory i diseases wind heat transformation cold nevertheless idea pathogenic factor may invade winter incubate without symptoms manifest spring root pathology latent heat pathology described nei jing illustrated diagram please note take nei jing scheme literally invasion necessarily cold necessarily occur winter necessarily come spring essential aspect pathology seasonal occurrence fact pathogenic factor invades body without symptoms i without immune system reacting properly pathogenic factor incubates inside come later also please note coming mean pathogenic factor expelled simply emerging interior manifesting various symptoms causes latent heat main cause development latent heat i patient display symptoms time infection pathogenic factor lurks interior emerge later kidney deficiency causes immune system react initial external invasion contributory factor immunizations could said immunizations inject pathogenic factor directly blood level emerges latent heat causing many different symptoms normal immunity someone infected pathogenic factor penetrates wei level leads immunity bacteria virus latent heat develops invasions wind cause immediate exterior symptoms cause immediate symptoms penetrate interior lurk incubate answer lies immune response immune system react pathogenic factor cause symptoms penetrates interior emerge later lack immune response depends lungs also kidneys ye tian shi said lurking cold winter resides kidneys remember nei jing statement jing guarded winter wen bing develops spring ye tian shi even advocated tonifying kidneys prevent invasion external pathogenic factors doctors late qing correlated severity latent pathogenic factor kidney specifically kidney yin ye tian shi said latent heat due lack storage jing winter allows cold invade body winter kidneys control storage shao yin spring pathogenic factor emerges towards shao yang liver gall bladder another explanation winter cold invades tai yang channels lurks inside transmitted shao yin cold enters tai yang latent heat emerges shao yin another doctor says winter cold heavy causes new invasion immediate symptoms winter cold light causes latent heat incubating inside says latter case pathogenic factor enters skin lurks triple burner membrane source mo yuan causing derangement ascending descending free flow causes stagnation gives rise internal heat heat attracted outwards emerging yang spring interesting statement actually explains external cold transformed internal heat latent heat formed membrane source mo yuan refers shao yang regions many doctors relate formation latent heat kidney deficiency example one says winter controls storage kidneys kidneys healthy kidney yang kidney jing stored winter cold invade body conversely mental restlessness overwork excessive desire afflict person yang dispersed yin consumed pathogenic factors easily invade body taking advantage empty condition thus seen several passages kidneys kidney jing play important role immune response yuan immune response chapter nan jing says sometimes cun kou normal yet patient dies pulses channels originate yuan yuan root channels motive force dong kidneys root zang fu channels gate breathing origin triple burner spirit guards pathogenic factors evil influences root humankind root cut stalks leaves wither cun kou normal patient dies means yuan cut internally passage establishes principle yuan therefore kidneys play role resistance pathogenic factors interestingly calls yuan shen protect pathogenic factors evils huge clinical significance means resistance pathogenic factors depends wei therefore lungs also kidneys yuan also jing due extraordinary vessels case wei stems lower burner symptoms signs latent heat main clinical manifestations latent heat emerges weary limbs irritability thirst lassitude sudden onset dark urine red tongue rapid fine pulse may many symptoms heat red eyes mouth ulcers nosebleed constipation general symptoms great variation symptoms signs depending location character latent heat ying blood makes latent heat emerge mentioned please note emerging mean latent heat expelled simply manifesting latent heat emerges due one following factors new invasion wind rising yang spring pulls emotional stress overwork serious illness medication drugs know latent heat heat clinical manifestations latent heat indeed heat know latent heat internally generated heat definite absolute way knowing diagnosis depends lot onset history rather clinical manifestations happen see patient onset latent heat emerging know latent heat acute onset patient complains lassitude acute onset exterior symptoms exclude invasion exterior pathogenic factor acute onset together clinical manifestations heat tells probably latent heat emerging previous external invasion cause symptoms time see patient acute onset difficult know latent heat first channel location either shao yang common shao yin i heart kidneys secondly latent heat cause vague less specific clinical manifestations heat heat specific organ heart heat stomach heat liver heat etc difference make treatment treatment latent heat really different heat latent heat treated clearing heat usually blood level however treating latent heat i also tonify kidneys usually one two herbs acupuncture difference makes prognosis makes big difference prognosis treatment latent heat difficult heat take longer also latent heat tends cause difficult diseases auto immune diseases nature latent heat acute onset emerges always heat may dampness heat tends injure yin latent pathogenic factor incubates body winter hides membrane source mo yuan transformed heat urine important diagnostic sign latent heat firstly dark urine important sign heat confirms diagnosis latent heat secondly darkness urine important gauge severity disease darker severe latent heat
