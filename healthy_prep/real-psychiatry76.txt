carl hart neuroscience professor department head columbia wrote opinion piece first edition new journal nature human behavior social consequences calling addiction brain disease original article reference link i encourage anyone interested read several times i say concepts contained article emotional confusing politicized repeated reading allows clearer picture concepts introduction discusses early hope learning neuroscience curing addiction neural manipulations could help rid resource poor communities crime poverty main arguments notion addiction disease majority people use drug become addicted old argument typically used psychiatric disorders actual lesion brain differentiate addicted non addicted uses example huntington parkinson disease brain diseases nobody would argue form initial premises lost student rhetoric one follow disease occurs result environmental exposure likely large percentage exposed population develop disease lot depends toxicity exposure personal biology exposed one best examples alcohol exposure takes certain amount exposure cause pancreatitis cirrhosis cause observable end organ damage yet vast majority people exposed alcohol develop neither epidemiological estimates also group averaged effects possible observe outliers ingested well beyond suggested dose necessary produce disease yet evidence damage results even variable comes wernicke korsakoff syndrome alcohol related illness caused thiamine deficiency vast majority alcoholics never develop symptoms significant number people significant number diagnosed autopsy alive autopsy diagnosis possible discrete brain lesions caused disorder brain lesion argument inaccurate number levels first equating disease brain lesion accurate medical diagnostic terminology always approximate rather precise comes pathognomonic lesions nobody seems argue migraine headaches cluster headaches diseases significant disability despite fact brain lesions like neurodegenerative diseases identified biological substrates differentiate migraine patients rest population syndenham pointed disorders identified based consistent pattern symptoms family history natural history course predictable response treatment general trend led merskey say royal road medical diagnosis every condition defined lesion several lesion favorite cervicalgia neck pain follow icd codes small problem least half population aged older significant degenerative arthritis much spine make things even nonspecific practically patients abnormal imaging studies spine unless clear finding physical exam electrophysiological testing pain attributed specific lesion pain becomes chronic even less connection underlying anatomy physiology connections real diseases biological substrates hard fast means addition syndenham approach disease definition common sense approach even psychiatric disorders addictions clear laboratory test polls indicate generally recognized diseases physicians public general i would argue physicians encounter severest problems groups people i speculate public realizes uncontrolled use intoxicant point disrupts life leads steady psychosocial deterioration point significant relationships lost unable self correct form disease close severe psychiatric problems severe life threatening problems beyond person capacity self correct seen diseases dr hart next argument one found media past two years research funding directed psychosocial aspects addiction rather neurobiological basic science aspects seen line reasoning applied stanley foundation grant look genetics psychiatric disorders national institute health budget generally utilitarian argument based premise basic science brain research produces useful solutions lack focus psychosocial determinants consequences drug use addiction initial argument people use drugs get addicted follow would widespread consequences terms determinants studied many cases detail context racial disparities care studying even applying common sense produce solution clearest example years research psychotherapies effective designing health system designed ignore fact addiction psychosocial research even readily ignored argument diseased brain model leads unrealistic policies quite stretch dr hart suggests model allows two solutions focus diseased brain focus removing drug society incorrectly concludes focus brain removes interest socioeconomic factors maintaining mediating drug addiction practically available treatment addiction whether involves residential outpatient treatment cognitive behavioral therapy twelve step recovery involves comprehensive look psychosocial factors may impede recovery keep cycle addiction going really need research know psychosocial factors increase exposure addictive drugs exposure first part problem already concluded vast number exposed end addicted exposure particular person end addiction different group psychosocial determinants tell differences exist makes statement insidious assumption diseased brain theory use certain drug considered pathological even non problematic recreational use characterizes experience overwhelming majority ingest drugs statement totally incorrect people like me treating people addictions definition uncontrolled use drug point longer able function many cases accumulated considerable medical psychiatric comorbidity inability stop using drugs i talking i consider addiction brain based disease disease involves ingestion intoxicant predictable long term consequences recreational use issue recreational use taken lightly according cdc person addicted prescription opioids times likely use heroin compared person every addicted prescription opioid user i talked started recreational user since i see people addictions recreational users opioids i see could tolerate opioids moved something else crux dr hart argument seems focus neuroscience led malignant law enforcement efforts eliminate drug use marginalized citizens cites differences legal penalties crack cocaine opposed powdered cocaine frequent illustration discrimination blacks opposed suburban whites seems ignore fact drug alcohol use takes heavy toll toll occurs independent race leap neuroscience politics law enforcement quite leap possible example police prosecutors politicians involved likely discriminate marginalized citizens hart refers i would say highly likely would offer several posts blog documenting active discrimination politicians insurance companies addicts mentally ill none people making discriminatory policies rationing resources denying rational treatment care one bit neuroscience barely know brain located head let me conclude know addictions knowledge peripherally related politics significant portion population risk addiction many know notice several generations addicts alcoholics family general people see trend without talking professional exposure drugs alcohol critical variable contrary suggestion recreational use people predisposed addictions recognize early pattern use distinct peers recognize one point ability control gone recognize taking heavy toll physical health mental health finances relationships ca stop recognize neurobiological features like craving tolerance withdrawal importantly purposes dr hart argument addiction equal opportunity disease racism certainly suggested otherwise historical basis opioid epidemic reach rural america illustrated anyone become heroin addict exposure drug critical factor genes determine skin color call disease want lay people physicians would agree qualification definition disease imprecise people arguing addiction disease seem know demonstrable changes due addiction animal models humans course modern addiction medicine text books exhaustively list chapter specific addictive drug much specific call addiction cite actual neurobiology study like modern approaches number difficult biological problems medicine rule psychosocial research addiction research happens time problem problem previously noted psychiatric research years research proven psychosocial therapies psychiatry modest effect sizes problem nobody pay strong overlap addiction since many therapies similar real cause discrimination level scientific community real cause discrimination occurs levels bureaucrats running healthcare system political system
