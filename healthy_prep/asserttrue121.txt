electroconvulsive therapy accepted treatment schizophrenia refractory depression years widely promoted highly effective technique nevertheless practitioners technique vastly oversell benefits egregiously understating dangers something i talk length references scientific data book hack depression note references listed throughout post summarized book well online patients must assisted breathing since muscle relaxants given prior procedure tend paralyze lungs medical profession prides utilizing evidence based medicine evidence quite ancient adhere modern requirements double blind technique control populations blind assessments sham treatment control groups etc followup periods generally short seldom month attempts assess safety recently shoddy haphazard consent forms regularly lie actual risks involved consequently patient arguably ever given informed consent procedure since information provided consent forms obsolete factually incorrect proper critique begins look scientific standing never mind fact mode action understood work post talks subsequent posts look question whether prevents suicide whether actually harms people terms short long term cognitive effects terms death start noting modern evidence based medicine relies use placebo controlled double blind studies literature goes back years overwehlming majority studies conducted time failed include placebo groups studies claim high response rate patients lack control arm thus conform modern standards evidence based medicine also response rate data long term focus almost always treatment period last days general anesthesia introduced possible include control arm studies since way trick fully awake patient thinking shocked grand mal seizure advent anesthesia possible use sham treatment consisting anesthetizing patient administering steps procedure except shock sham patient told wakes shock applied sham technique currently implemented hardly considered faithful placebo however since fails replicate aspects bonafide treatment anterograde retrograde amnesia headache fatigue muscle ache valid comparison would require placebo induces injury obviously unethical sham produces none typical cognitive somatic effects real thing patients likely guess correctly whether shocked hence blind breakage serious concern even properly designed studies expected result lower sham response rates might otherwise observed worth bearing mind proceed nine meta analyses compared sham depression gabor laszlo greenhalgh et al janicak et al kho et al pagnin et al ross tharyan adams uk review group van der wurff et al see complete list references except one ross make claim superior sham treatment period usually one month none found evidence difference outcome beyond treatment period claims superiority versus placebo based effects seen treatment period one month first month differences sham groups one author ross said claims textbooks review articles effective consistent published data six studies considered janicak et al two said produced significant differences sham one crossover design study gave sham group treatment period confounding results another old study ulett et al photoshock results flashing light technique combined hexazol conflated janicak review found ross contain numerous serious factual errors calling question usefulness uk review group meta analysis reported one study met inclusion criteria follow studies study found significant difference study question fact reported followup data page report greenhalgh et al concluded little evidence long term efficacy even short term low dose unilateral effective sham review found randomised evidence effectiveness specific subgroups including older people children adolescents people catatonia women postpartum exacerbations depression schizophrenia one nine meta analyses mentioned cochrane systematic review focused specifically effectiveness depressed elderly van der wurff et al review found evidence effective beyond treatment period identified one study comparing sham leary et al study question analysis data paper three reviewers gregory et al reviewers described major methodological shortcomings conclusion none objectives review could adequately tested lack firm randomised evidence addition meta analyses versus sham depression meta analyses along lines schizophrenia report american psychiatric association admits none five pre versus sham studies found differences outcomes even short term claimed three recent studies demonstrated substantial advantage abraham kulhara brandon et al taylor fleminger three studies however patient groups receiving antipsychotic medications advantage fact short lived leicester trial brandon et al example sham groups improved four measures used global psychopathology differ however authors note superiority real demonstrated week follow another studies taylor fleminger found treatment equal improvement groups although improved general psychopathology faster sham first four weeks taylor fleminger study psychiatrists unblinded ones perceive difference groups nurses relatives see difference might psychiatrists better trained rate symptoms also likely reflective researcher bias since studies done researchers strongly advocate use believe benefits recent study sarita et al people diagnosed schizophrenia found differences double blind ratings four symptom measures one two three four weeks treatment comparison sham either bilateral unilateral study ukpong et al likewise failed find significant differences sham end treatment also failed find differences weeks later update cochrane database tharyan adams found short term advantage sham evidence early advantage maintained medium long term cochrane reviewers found even short term less effective antipsychotic medication recently poublon haagh published systematic review schizophrenia drawing randomized controlled studies included sham arm found six studies four six produced statistically significant improvement relative sham treatment period followup significant differences remained authors said evidence found proving superiority sham followup whole effectiveness far different sham different treatment period raising possibility anesthesia rather electrical shock produces much therapeutic effect tending confirm possibility fact ketamine general anesthetic recently found therapeutic treatment severe depression mcgirr et al study compare anesthetics used respect effect depression outcomes analysis variance might reveal extent choice anesthetic influences outcomes would tend establish degree therapeutic effect due strictly anesthesia unfortunately studies yet done colin ross institute psychological trauma richardson texas summed situation well paper author reviewed placebo controlled literature electroconvulsive therapy depression study demonstrated significant difference real placebo sham month post treatment many studies failed find difference real sham even period treatment claims textbooks review articles effective consistent published data large properly designed study real versus sham undertaken absence study consent forms
