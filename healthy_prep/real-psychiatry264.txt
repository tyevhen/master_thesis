i thought i would comment recent legislative auditor report lar entitled clinical drug study university minnesota department psychiatry dan markingson case special review review focused primarily ethical conflict interest requirements laws policies guidelines rather clinical care given i felt compelled comment report several reasons first foremost i minnesota psychiatrist i practice psychiatry gives me first hand knowledge experience several nuances report obvious commentary second i interest quality psychiatric care research third i conflicts interest report matter i appointment university minnesota department psychiatry largely teaching medical students residents peripheral campus primary affiliation terms residency training hennepin regions program affiliated university last resident i involved supervising program one year ago teaching always considered requirement work without additional compensation like practically physicians actual source income productivity based defined number patients i see i received check university minnesota since i resident i conflicts interest regard industry encourage anyone try find me big pharma database years working acute care setting state uniquely qualifies me address issues involving civil commitment stays commitment competency consent literally handful people qualifications state i know i also peer review organization reviewer minnesota wisconsin experience human subjects committees institutional review boards pharmacy therapeutic committees hospitals major healthcare organizations far i know i may psychiatrist state combination experience i list qualifications two reasons immediately relevant review also speak comment board medical practice retain consultants i offered consultant two occasions even acknowledge i applied i also need preface remarks say i knowledge case reported documents i commenting lack original documents fda report mentioned lar report search fda web site revealed powerpoint document ended description different types competency i know none people involved working relationships i relatives business associates relationships finally i want acknowledge reason report investigations death dan markingson physicians psychiatrists lowest threshold prevention patient death nobody supposed ever die care physicians supposed make assessment patient risk every time see person i reviewing reports conclusions far removed original event i acutely aware shock family occurs events effort takes try prevent i want clear i trying second guess offend anybody report reviewing hundreds thousands hospital records i fully aware fact records inadequate substitute events actually occurred reviewing events retroscope generally changes everything i also acutely aware fact case severe mental illness may get one chance things correctly right way may unclear facts case facts case concerns transparency make sense me i think material facts case changed since outset time suicide occurs state minnesota triggers coroner investigation coroner investigators coroner office get contact doctors involved treating patient case also malpractice case settled court prior settlement would produced exhaustive amount information detail malpractice proceeding details opinions gathered unfavorable treating physicians persistent arguments case involves disclosed manner disclosed many disclosures far original events involve principle parties clear legislative auditor report lar bulk report read existing reports made determinations adequacy reports whether agreed authors reports cases submitted questions

conflict interest legislative auditor report represents point view document strikes me less neutral lack neutrality starts description medication powerful drug statement like come document put together nonphysicians i prescribed much risperidone anyone consider powerful drug fact descriptions psychiatric medication start like written people either know much medication going start talking psychiatric medications psychiatrists particular point view generally one favorable news media picked letter former governor arne carlson report cases characterized blasting various elements university gov carlson letter mentioned report discussions issue competency consent research opinion ombudsman mental health mental retardation figures prominently well efforts minnesota legislature ban committed patients pharmaceutical research also apparently tried ban patients stay commitment similar specific case national alliance mental illness minnesota objected according press account organization contended mentally ill patients benefit experimental drugs treatments traditional therapy fails i think lot people reading report might miss important fact fine print words premier advocacy organization patients families severe mental illnesses want patients stays commitment banned research seems fairly clear me lar doubts anything dr olsen say lack financial incentives enroll patients study suggest may easy investigate i would think salaries university employees public record seem similar level skepticism applied anything supports main contentions adversarial proceeding evident various critics commentators write like unaware take perspective grant tone ultimate moral authority reason considering facts contradict facts reason considering point view attorney representing university time quoted criticized omissions i thought standard accepted behavior attorneys moreover adversarial process i would expect one party make party look bad possible party defensive try make look good possible i would speculate point malpractice lawsuit lawyers telling everyone involved say probably say anything criticize comments misleading fact people defensive legal case unwilling discuss seems little disingenuous me semblance honest exchange generally evaporates civil legal involvement decision decide things facts case potentially courtroom proceeding saying somehow attitudes drastically change lawsuit settled would also disingenuous i know new approaches suggested emotionally charged situations handled including acknowledging mistakes made i wonder authors articles ever situation unexpected death patient expectation patient die even though much higher mortality group peers various points career contact peers claim never lost patient make adequate decision state mind i would suggest able long emotional turmoil continues issue competency state minnesota one main points contention articles case whether mr markingson competent consent participate research project whether consent continuing cooperation coerced rather voluntary consent numerous authors documents seem recognize considered competent consent state minnesota minnesota statute subd subd legal results commitment status except otherwise provided chapter sections person reason commitment treatment pursuant chapter shall deprived legal right including limited right dispose property sue sued execute instruments make purchases enter contractual relationships vote hold driver license commitment treatment patient pursuant chapter judicial determination legal incompetency except extent provided section subdivision interest space considerations i would invite reader click link subd read exceptions medical care clear reading statute committed patients competent consenters hierarchy substituted consent also seems confusion issue civil commitment court ordered antipsychotic medication competency common problem acute care psychiatric settings committed patient needs acute medical treatment patients considered competent make decisions case opinion agrees medical surgical consultant problems case acute life threatening problem like bleeding disagree issue competency comes play state minnesota hierarchy substituted consent problematic practice absent interested family members requires additional separate hearing civil commitment hearings also generally requires patient family retain private legal representation purpose creates hurdle significant enough cases prevent timely provision acute medical surgical care i heard argument university concerned right rather right thing seems rhetorical me physician choice follow laws state issue also commented lar report judges pages specific judges case named judges cases described mr markingson competent stating evidence competent i really think compelling evidence favor competency make decisions decision judge hearing actual case issue consent form i seen consent form i seen form checklist sorts determine competency lar report includes highlights reports two different psychologists may implications competency psychiatrists trained assess patients general specific competence general competency ability function handle one affairs day day basis gutheil appelbaum suggest includes mix current awareness ability assess current facts situation ability adequately process risk benefit information day day functioning specific competence focused person needs able elaborate thought process demonstrate reasoning logical manner authors action guide p needs complete either type competency evaluation bottom line takes time i doubt antipsychotic trial would use standard would two problems first would reliability problems psychiatrists evaluations second would would significant number people screened would pass evaluation i able find literature looking issue rigorous competency evaluations patients psychosis research candidates objective evaluation general competency could done approach specific competency consent research needs lot work competency issues really different patient enrolled research projects outside field psychiatry good general validated approach issue specific competency consent pharmaceutical research would benefit entire field said investigator i recall consent form clearly say research subject could quit time decision quit would way affect current future medical care would receive health care system part standard research consent pharmaceutical research evidence based medicine general mechanics project familiar me participation research projects investigator practically studies research coordinators medical credentials necessary sheer amount paperwork involved drug trials research coordinators representatives study families end spectrum responsible protocol paperwork submitted fda appears uniform qualification research coordinators appear career path work research appears reflect clinical practice good thing research i participated initial phase antipsychotic trials done specified period time inpatient unit thinking disrupting patient maintenance medication could lead acute exacerbations psychosis certainly research i involved even case known medications dose equivalency always issue changing one medication another case study involved trial medications quetiapine risperidone olanzapine already approved fda question whether study even necessary could answered acute care inpatient psychiatrist time original study i already treated hundreds patients study medications acute care inpatient settings looking one publications authors describe sample size patients like acute care psychiatrists i treated multiples number surprising results study level idea double blind studies using human subjects needs challenged comes highest levels called evidence based medicine reading thorough cochrane collaboration antipsychotic drug practically medications indication see conclusions inadequate methodology study necessary true point i would see conclusions approaching level fallacy i really need large multi center study tell me people respond medication tolerate may want take information useless me i already made necessary changes lot faster research protocol change day day clinical care today called evidence based world give clinicians front lines nearly enough credit i wait blessing cochrane collaboration i would incapable work given effort required design run trials difficulty recruiting patients research question study important i would suggest evidenced fact physicians like me clinical practice already know answers lot faster feet evidence based medicine currently problem national level local problem minnesota also significant political implications i pointed issue mail one top epidemiologists world months ago far response care people severe mental illnesses general outline i provided elements good psychiatric care advice residents still applies additional considerations honed years experience settings foremost among recognizing life threatening nature severe mental illness lot people direct responsibility concern patient well concern deal abstract live culture bias idea even idea mental illnesses exist surprising people find difficult accept idea severe mental illnesses exist also represent high level risk individual even people know better hard time keeping latter concept clear focus i assessment i looking anything possible allow me look future risk i minimize even currently lack technology produce degree certainty would like important aspect kind care
