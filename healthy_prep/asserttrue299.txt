looking base composition statistics codons amazing fact jumps look carefully following graph see cloud gold colored data points representing compositional stats second base codons clostridium botulinum second breakaway cloud underneath see arrow codon base composition statistics clostridium botulinum notice breakaway cloud gold points main cloud arrow points represent genes codons pyrimidine middle base codon review i made plot going dna sequence coding cds gene botulinum gene i went codons calculated average purine content well average content bases positions one two three codons thus every dot represents stats one gene worth data looking graphs sort three key facts codon bases leap codons genes purine first base notice red cloud points higher others centering third base often called wobble base shown blue extreme value well known middle base falls one two positions high low purine axis primary cloud data points secondary cloud distinct region main cloud secondary cloud gold points centered axis meaning genes second codon base tends pyrimidine question mean look gene codons majority codons pyrimidine second base examine standard codon translation table see codons pyrimidine second position represented first two columns table code primarily nonpolar amino acids pyrimidine second base possible amino acids phenylalanine serine leucine proline isoleucine methionine threonine valine alanine serine threonine nonpolar therefore pyrimidine position two codon means least chance amino acid nonpolar hydrophobic side group virtually proteins contain nonpolar amino acids protein contains mostly nonpolar amino acids protein destined wind cell membrane largely made lipids thus expect find genes breakaway cloud gold points graph represent
