new york times editorial pages continue place anti neuroscience rhetoric expressed primarily decreased funding accurately portion available nimh funding maybe pro neuroscience opinion expressed i missed i recently posted exciting development neuroscience teaching psychiatrists psychiatric residents post i reference opinion piece richard friedman md psychiatrist dr friedman makes several arguments psychotherapy unrelated neuroscience based premise concludes substitute psychotherapy people brain jar anyone benefiting psychotherapy seems prove i found incredible statement considering according koch graphic brain single complex object universe also fact billion people earth billion unique conscious states vast majority accurately described dsm psychodynamic diagnosis formulation time dr friedman mounting critique also discusses importance clinical research suggests shifting funding balance away neuroscience recent case john markowitz professor clinical psychiatry columbia subtle form argument case previous opinion piece authors endorse importance neuroscience point case argument yes neuroscience important let reestablish balance neuroscience clinical studies looking efficacy psychotherapies breaking dr markowitz makes following points directorship thomas insel nimh clinical research budget strangled resources diverted neuroscience research author acknowledges need neuroscience research primitive stage psychiatric diagnostics based clusters signs symptoms really basis insel rdoc initiative looking reliable markers psychiatric syndromes practicing psychiatrist seen iterations dsm realizes far go manual includes standpoint validity also terms clinical examination psychiatrists long contained manual clinical method psychiatry remain stuck somewhere extremely disconcerting profession future psychiatrists dsm technology extremely limiting terms usual clinical trials nimh sponsored star study decade half old point defined response rates antidepressant therapies provided discussion point psychotherapy trials depression clinical trials antidepressants provide equally varied result practicing clinician knows studies seriously flawed gate using dsm diagnoses also intent treat analysis resemble clinical practice variation diagnoses depression anxiety depression plus anxiety seen clinical practice point fact patient selection clinical trials currently results heterogenous patient populations terms therapeutic effects medication tolerability continue spend large sums money trials mixtures patient populations post modest positive results attempt identify patients respond specifically experience side effects particular therapy real promise neuroscience based research patients need help poorly served current neuroscience research helpful psychotherapies listed author like interpersonal psychotherapy ipt cognitive behavioral therapy cbt psychotherapies around decades i happen copies interpersonal psychotherapy klerman weissman rounsaville chevron cognitive therapy depression beck rush shaw emery publication date former latter therapies years point studied hundreds times looking clinical trials medline yields cbt ipt clinical trials successful like ipt cocaine use never made clinical practice fact places getting therapist actually practices specific research proven psychotherapies impossible problem seem lack psychotherapy research lack access practitioners use research proven psychotherapies mental health treatment highly rationed treatment resource additional studies continue prove existing psychotherapies work seems superfluous point current studies often compared existing therapies dsm problem contributing diagnostic heterogeneity new trials funded serious conditions therapy might useful reason expect new therapy applied using current diagnostic system clinical trials technology lead enhanced treatment effects existing treatments good enough author attributes good enough statement insel i understand point trying make author points continued suffering treatment failures suicides evidence needed problem assurance clinical research add time certainly focus suicide stand alone problem suggested dsm serious disorders treatment like adult anorexia nervosa warranted even left clinical trials technology consistently produces modest results best multimillion dollar trials psychotherapy already know somewhat effective patients chance ever receiving backdrop really depression anxiety seems like waste time money me seems like much better idea develop neuroscience method determine needs psychotherapy might benefit medications even treatments readily available medications even less half affected patients get access treatment good luck trying find psychotherapist insurance company willing cover cost number sessions used psychotherapy research research proven therapies good number practitioners using access practitioners placing eggs one basket argument basically saying ratio clinical neuroscience funding risk missing something big clinical research getting useful results neuroscience given history i provided needs clear advance clinical side order fund large trials make sense continue fund slight modifications treatment common disorders eggs one basket i would call treatment usual years i practice nothing i would call major breakthrough clinical research results come go effective psychiatrists effective psychiatrists based breakthroughs approach clinical practice even mode treatment threatened widespread support collaborative care justified using kind research justified managed care first place end nothing destructive terms access care mental disorders managed care many ways ongoing arguments resemble arguments biological psychiatrists psychotherapy psychiatrists i trained many programs split artificial division residents left identify biological psychotherapy faculty interesting note division occurred time kandel wrote paper psychotherapy neuroscience action may missed biologically based psychiatrists time really focused pharmacology neuroendocrinology rather comprehensive neuroscience neuroscience old diagnostic technology clinical methods seem current points division lot criticism directed insel i heard talk initiatives rationale sounded clear me i think rationale similar i discussed far clinical psychiatrists also realization long live approximate world get approximate results inertia stay place always puzzling me time move clinical psychiatry way currently researched practiced holds promise
