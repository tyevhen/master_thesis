i posts ready go i wanted end year positive note i could think anything positive old mentor back town suggesting meet breakfast i would i today without mentors mentors told me silent mentors i could identity types invaluable guy clear idea wanted life comes people carefully plan life people kind random walk i firmly latter camp time college reason i went college play football i got scholarship take long discover bad idea discovery facilitated gangrenous appendix hospital stay one professors came visit basically told me snap drop idea coaching physical education minor something rigorous academically literally told me i wasting time animated left i wondered unpopular professor reputation eccentricity would visit freshman known month tell me life trajectory wrong would i immediately see right long i met chemistry biology professors i could identify i also positive experiences english philosophy professors led increasing motivation academic rigor medical school much different natural gravitate neuroanatomists biochemists neurosurgeons neurologists internists endocrinologists nephrologists cardiologists infectious disease specialists learning medicine psychiatry medical school residency exciting immersive educational experience professors stimulating inspiring i consider fields second computer match several specialties psychiatry next step i met mentor pgy year left private practice research never doubt extremely knowledgeable psychiatry time active debate called biological psychiatrists psychiatrists psychotherapy oriented biological psychiatrists basically phenomenologists search biological paradigms time prominent paradigms time psychopharmacology genetics primate research neuroendocrinology many cases residents split identification faculty alienation others mentor comfortable areas could discuss biological theories introduce conduct psychodynamic psychotherapy explained made things possible highlighted discussions examples experience asked me questions really like psychiatrist suppose cocktail party person approaches person appears acting react like psychiatrist think put psychiatrist hold questions pgys time contemplate night call psychiatric units full transplant patients many difficult control diabetes worked seeing patients usual patients presentation clinic hospital i moved different program last two years biological psychiatry versus psychotherapists going new program interestingly biological researchers strong interests psychodynamic behavioral therapy program i ever seen pharmacotherapy contingent whether behavior therapy attempted successful even psychiatrists orientation original mentor ordered breakfast settled first time would talking hour years i talked briefly outside lecture getting ready apa meeting brought me speed got ground floor psychiatric research particular specialty apparent knew field cold mailed me several papers later discussed medical problems morbidity aging process discussed issues come teaching residents i remembered things told me personality style dead talked concern fda contraindication bupropion active resolved eating disorders needed done discussed historical development dsm limitations told me something i never heard organized psychology tried come alternative dsm iii failed i informed psychodynamic diagnostic manual pdm experience discussing east coast clinicians made jokes technically peers always easy relate hour wound settled truths come years psychiatry i thought i would include positive jumping point new year biology i always reflected teachers clinical psychiatry concluded i fortunate taught best two different programs started mentor two thirds way conversation made statement i found myself complete agreement i medical school psychiatry primitive state lot due nature versus nurture argument psychiatric assessment mental status exam changed since time generally data points gathered standard assessment goal come formulation problem separate list diagnoses resident course need dsm diagnoses problem explanatory power formulation necessarily robust end presentation somebody crowd could always say nature nurture either end spectrum formulation could encompass cares nature nurture i prescribe medication specific diagnoses i psychotherapy repressed narcissistic rage i prescribe little amitriptyline needed sleep hardly robust explanatory paradigms old popperian baggage psychoanalytic theories falsifiable biggest missed opportunity residency capitalizing neuroscience day academic centers i studying firmly primatology neuroendocrinology psychopharmacology nobody seemed pick kandel early work decade much debate biological psychiatry definition i picking time treatment medications focus neurotransmitters neural transmission entire residency occurred advent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris atypical antipsychotics aaps effective medication indication lithium still probably case intervening decades neuroscience taken early appreciation complexity brain nervous system advances every year close point able investigate putative neuroscience based mechanisms stress psychological trauma environmentally determined epigenetic changes cause important changes behavior common psychiatric syndromes genetically determined changes drug metabolism primary genetic transmission mental disorders explosion information molecular biology addiction dementias seems many people discovered last years kandel writing psychotherapy changes biology else would work information immediately relevant psychiatrists last thing need another research proven psychotherapy i found i psychotherapy training residency second none resident occurred primarily one hour direct supervision every hour i session patient hours per year three years psychotherapy supervisors diverse terms orientation i picked additional training inpatient services psychoanalysts others seemed obvious me say something useful people see typically flowed one form therapy psychiatry due severity problem general lack medical care flexibility necessary i recall making diagnosis probable partial complex seizures patient i thought short term psychodynamic crisis oriented therapy might useful years psychotherapy research led manuals standardized approaches i remember getting early copy linehan dialectical behavior therapy mailed directly me inventor i accumulated library psychotherapy texts supportive psychodynamic behavioral cognitive behavioral recent modifications problem psychotherapy never lack useful models fairly good evidence psychotherapy may specific therapists different schools could get good results general lack adequate research psychodynamic psychoanalytic therapy also clinical trials may left wrong impression i recall early partially negative trial psychotherapy schizophrenia seemed counter older anecdotal literature recent cognitive behavioral therapy schizophrenia severe mental illnesses seems correct idea psychotherapy useful discussion psychotherapy agreed really research based psychotherapy available largely due managed care environments i thought average number sessions managed care patients read article suggesting either way practical limitations psychiatrists settings scheduled brief medication focused visits long intervals person severe mental illness crisis situation may seen every months minutes even rationed sparse setting i worked psychiatrist established incredible relationships people i people asking me years left i knew become agreed futile keep psychotherapy research heterogeneous populations inventing different psychotherapies results generally probably limited varying subject characteristics research proven psychotherapy provided due managed care rationing therapeutic alliance useful discussions patients need continued application nothing useful tends happen unless patient believes clearly understood communicated psychiatrist residents care dsm fake news release dsm i maintained hype hardly necessary imperfect classification system slightly important psychiatrists nobody else agreed useful residents learn really important practicing psychiatrists basis agreement need residents learn know deficiencies strong points better anybody else caused me recall electronic medical record i use major diagnostic category listed diagnoses nearly total dsm many i difficulty finding correct one like psychiatrists i using diagnoses recognize limitations diagnoses limitations idea simple verbal descriptions parse complicated organ large number useful diagnoses good breakfast i happy see mentor happy see me along way i think i evolved competent clinical psychiatrist similar skill set except extensive research i know residents class i feel privileged elevated acquiring skills directly mentors colleagues along way transformed early random walk academics focused professional life i grateful happy new year george
