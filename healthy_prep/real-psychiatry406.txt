glaxo smith kline came major announcement days ago longer pay doctors promote drugs longer tie compensation sales force number prescriptions written doctors detailed drugs standard practices pharmaceutical industry first announcement kind within industry gsk continue provide unsolicited independent educational grants educational institutions medical societies pharmaceutical reps paid basis technical knowledge customer service rather sales gsk fined heavily lately promoting label use products currently investigation china immediate reaction piece good riddance past decade bigger issue psychiatry appearance conflict interest pharmaceutical industry psychiatry targeted medical specialty prominent politicians news media even psychiatrists endless blogs opinion pieces practice psychiatry defined appearance conflict interest several blogs gained prominence endlessly reviewing details affected way apa business affected way local district branches business end politicians grandstanding ppaca obamacare apparently list physician receiving money pharmaceutical company suggested motivating factor ny times article public lists existed states like one i practiced years me arguments always come advertising ethics advertising perspective would expect people affected product advertising course would buying habits american population shaped advertising selling products science people think american public easily change buying habits purchase products unnecessary discarded brief period time also sold products like junk food unhealthy designed sold large quantities advertising would seem ideal basis marketing drugs physicians many new products physicians bypassed drug sold directly consumer epidemiology particular problem like low known direct consumer marketing probably leads many many physician visits physician suggesting patient probably primary hypogonadotropic hypogonadism patient go web site take non specific checklist quiz features low doctor office get levels done within week things probably go lot smoother without physician intermediary loop i sure much physician behavior shaped onslaught men coming tested low i know fact psychiatrists approached problem overlap syndrome depression part advertising argument always unconscious factors play really basis advertising general main difference pharmaceutical representatives schooled relationship aspects sale taught basically physician likes feels indebted free food trinkets like poor quality pens never seem write well round golf tickets lakers game may likely prescribe product physicians apparently naive enough realize huge marketing database tracked prescription writing see writing required number prescriptions product real heyday marketing bonuses physicians companies would pay travel important meetings people focused advertising influence kept chipping away mostly psychiatrists seemed ignore two important developments made detailing selling individual physicians much less relevant first restricted formularies i pharmacy therapeutics committee p one largest health plans state affiliated hospital total years time predominant factor decision whether put drug formulary would make available prescribing physicians cost instances drug unique made available even expensive cases drug might available incurable illness negligible benefit included basically public relations one overriding themes p committee drugs particular class like antidepressants equivalent therefore least expensive drug class could substituted anything else potentially led lot unnecessary chaos medications fell favor due pricing patients needed shifted en masse least expensive drug gave hospitals health plans leverage dealing pharmaceutical companies cases deals complex example order get new blockbuster drug good price health plan would need accept company generic different class removed considered expensive decade ago business entrepreneurs decided money made rationing medications health plan enrollees lot done pharmaceutical benefit managers pbms pbms currently multibillion dollar industry second important development generic drugs practically blockbuster psychiatric medications past two decades generic drugs many generic drugs easily affordable even direct pocket purchases point longer actively marketed pharmaceutical company held exclusive patents likely preferred drugs pbms health plan formularies role scientific approximation approximation drugs certain class like antidepressants purported mechanism action equivalent one substituted another clearly false allows health plan provide least expensive medication charge hefty copay one also seems consider market information even affect generic drugs best example i think fda warnings citalopram i would guess despite warnings remains preferred drug health plans health plans general seem geared prescribe antidepressants higher higher rates i would take step venture guess health plans taken look data systems whether observed problems related fda warning citalopram ethical argument goes something like physicians best interests patients mind advertising based conflict interest prescribe certain drug creates ethical concern face seems like straightforward argument several problems example direct evidence occurs really believable physician would prescribe decidedly suboptimal medication patient based schmoozing pharmaceutical representative often factors play common treat people chronic illnesses suboptimal response current therapy looking next biggest thing try physician detailed next biggest thing likely prescribe asked similar dynamic issue overprescribing general patient persists request opioid antibiotic stimulant drug likely get recent declaration cdc initiative decrease antibiotic prescribing failed would suggest finally dynamic see doctor leave pill number scenarios medications used medical practice options even discussed psychiatric cases highlighted happens frequently cases mild diabetes mellitus back pain chronic pain various causes hypercholesterolemia mild hypertension others many people described doctor poised prescription pad healthcare industry set see people brief medication focused visits physician reimbursement tied also patient related factors recent tom hanks interview illustrative late night talk show discussing recent diagnosis diabetes mellitus said physician told could get back high school body weight probably would reply well i going type ii diabetes ethical arguments especially ones i seen constructed physicians also ignore general case conflicts interest professional level practically every major university department allows faculty supplement salaries consulting private industry many cases major source additional income cases professionals involved setting standards approach much different wall currently constructed medical profession pharmaceutical industry example academic industry professionals within engineering profession often committees responsible setting standards govern products within industry approach include many industry professionals necessary rather suggesting academics set standards considering pharmaceutical companies employ top scientists world would seem medicine lot lose goes along prevailing assumption prevailing assumption physicians powerless stop prescribing expensive medications questionable benefit patients based solely advertising scientific merit i applaud gsk decision even though cited factors would suggest physicians historical relevance i would encourage big pharma adopt policies toward physicians really go far enough basically token gesture point really make difference i would suggest stop giving money politicians gsk spent million candidates million lobbying last year money directed politicians part massive industry wide contribution politicians think buys influence giving free pizza pens doctors giving thousands tens thousands dollars politicians george dawson md dfapa katie thomas glaxo says stop paying doctors promote drugs new york times december
