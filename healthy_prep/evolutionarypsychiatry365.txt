i deficient vitamin course i paid attention official word sunshine bad ultraviolet radiation chops skin cell dna enough scrambled dna bit bad luck eventually get cancer several major types skin cancer melanoma scariest also sun gives wrinkles age spots i putting sunblock avoiding beach except days year least years time dermatologists women magazines scaring away sun fat phobia cultural trend eating less organ meat scared away best dietary sources key fat soluble vitamins k want low vitamins tend help orchestrate lot functions body vitamin found animal fats tend get sun particular seems involved biochemical soupy stuff body every day lot membrane signaling scavenging screwy cells starting go awry i cancer low vitamin seems put hugely increased risk cancer including melanoma prostate cancer breast cancer colon cancer fact women diagnosed breast cancer summer fall best prognosis reports chemotherapy working well winter also links mental health depression bipolar disorder psychotic disorders increased populations people stopped working outside went work inside elderly low vitamin also much higher rates depression study bone mineral density depression elderly poorer bone status also depressed vitamin explicitly stated possible linking factor illnesses would vitamin affect brain vitamin involved synthesis catecholamines highly involved neurotransmission summer sunlight increases brain serotonin levels twice much winter sunlight neurons glial cells kinds areas brain vitamin receptors indicating brain hungry use vitamin effects nervous system include synthesis neurotrophic factors i call brain fertilizer inhibition creation enzyme chews nitric oxide increasing glutathione levels see previous posts molecular description brain chemicals thought involved depression vitamin periphery associated scavenging cleaning cancer cells vitamin central nervous system seems involved detoxification anti inflammatory pathways supplementation help depression well first several studies disappointing harris dawson hughes tried treating seasonal affective disorder iu vitamin daily squat course plant form vitamin animal form iu tiny dose anyway lansdowne buddies gave iu iu vitamin healthy subjects late winter found lightened mood receiving supplements hollis gave people seasonal affective disorder single iu dose found effective light therapy improvement statistically correlated improvement serum oh vitamin levels intriguing study young adults given access tanning beds mondays wednesdays one bed uv light identical bed fridays participants allowed choose bed wanted time chose uv bed participants also reported relaxed uv tan sham bed unfortunately large well designed study supplementation depression i aware however enough interesting evidence trial done especially populations likely vitamin deficient elderly like fish oil vitamin cheap three month supply readily available given links diseases also heart disease stroke osteoporosis kidney damage hypertension name would seem prudent money saving public health standpoint lot cancer really prevented adequate supplementation test treat deficiency people psychiatric disorders another issue rda vitamin woefully small iu daily amount keep getting rickets certainly optimal amount humans i heard murmurings official rda going increased iu daily decent multivitamins iu vit already multi says rda cholecalciferol vit case wondering amount fortified milk also small one would need drink truckload matter much much vitamin need hey vitamin fat soluble vitamin means store long time could get toxic high amounts answer probably need many times current rda vitamin get reasonable serum levels stuff yes get toxic people realistic worry according vitamin council serum level ng ml higher oh vit optimal level without controversy accepted minimal acceptable level one probably want go though toxicity reported serum levels higher ca get much vitamin sun skin actually destroys excess vitamin made enough day cool regulatory mechanism ever i heard one could theoretically get toxicity combining high amounts supplementation lots sunshine description vitamin council website one guy actually get toxic supplements turned industrial accident made particular variety vitamins prolongevity contain times amount label guy taking iu million iu daily two years recovered uneventfully medicine sunscreen know enough vitamin well lifeguard miami probably fine dark skin unless lifeguard equator probably need supplementation take someone dark skin times longer sun get enough vitamin adequate levels compared someone pale skin live north degrees latitude new york city weeks summer expose skin get full amounts vitamin need last year may supplement controversy especially pale people northern european ancestry seemed live far north degrees days year could possibly get adequate vitamin sun anyway really know blood levels vitamin need get blood test key level need know oh vitamin doctor orders oh total vitamin might get right number make sure look lab slip want go doctor go website pay home testing kit unless live new york state home testing via mailing bloodspot cards apparently illegal let say ordered home test kit stabbed finger shipped spot blood back lab level comes ng ml general rule thumb iu supplementation daily increase blood levels ng ml use geltabs oil suspension rather tablets unless always going taking supplement oil fat let say aiming one could take iu daily morning already supplementing iu multivitamin example could take additional iu daily could skip additional supplementation days spent time sun without suncreen sunscreen block uvb rays synthesize vitamin skin arms legs exposure minutes midday summertime boston times week would get goodly amount probably around iu exposure pale skin kind exposure big deal skin cancer risk long avoid burning farther south get equator reverse paler less time need standard practice physicians treat vitamin deficiency iu pills week weeks recheck unfortunately recent jama study similar treatment elderly women admittedly iu daily days resulted great increase number fractures editorial study thought iu daily safer physiological amount treat deficiency sure getting adequate calcium however supplement calcium vitamin vitamin levels become adequate absorption calcium increase quite bit see slides therefore may need much calcium take vitamin recommendations set stone though current rda calcium may high simply get enough vitamin also prescription vitamin doses plant form probably nearly effective animal derived form yet another thing watch higher dose vitamin supplementation occasionally unmask hyperparathyroidism someone parathyroid working overdrive start serum levels calcium way high potentiated higher doses vitamin dangerous goes undetected though high calcium levels uncomfortable symptoms muscle twitching cramping fatigue insomnia depression thinning hair high blood pressure bone pain kidney stones headaches heart palpitations since bone pain fatigue depression insomnia symptoms low vitamin well important realize symptoms get worse supplementation see doctor get calcium parathyroid hormone checked i personally check calcium levels initial vitamin level i check follow ones i tend check three months home testing neat option initial level seeing doctor follow suggestions supplementation good idea level found low fat soluble vitamins k important enough things get bit screwy example order create bone need adequate vitamin least level adequate calcium vitamin k best sources animal fats particularly fats animals eat natural diet grass cows grubs grains whatnot chickens pastured chicken egg yolks butter liver pastured cows conventionally raised eggs th vitamins pastured eggs butter grain fed cows may little th much k pastured butter really matter animals eat ate vitamin also found multivitamins important much vitamin little i recommended multivitamin addition vit people deficient serum oh vitamin big liver eaters strict vegetarians another place need super careful eat might need choke fermented soy products netto get enough vitamin k k found standard multivitamin though make k k intestinal flora happy might standard american diet idea flora vegan diet interesting question vital bone formation keeping arteries resilient k warfarin blocks take coumadin blood clots though risk blood clots first place maybe much omega compared omega key part good lasting health either get plenty safe burns sun ancestors use today science get blood levels vitamin need chat doctor check vitamin council website information
