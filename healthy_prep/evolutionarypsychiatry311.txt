guys know martin levac i either someone active entertaining comments section denise minger big china study post towards end comments started mention human experiments semi starvation semi starvation means cutting lots calories lose weight eerily close government recommends try trying lose extra pounds human experiments people actually lost meaningful weight successfully done lockdown disaster martin mentioned famous ancel keys study wwii i brief post july bigger link thorough post dr eades really interested linked video months later also experience eight people less hermetically sealed big greenhouse arizona two years big greenhouse biosphere tale million experiment amazing flabbergasting worth post two much information series posts one biospherian books human experiment two years twenty minutes inside biosphere also number published scientific papers available accessible biosphere website decent wikipedia article first little background biosphere meant study large acre sealed ecosystem desert ocean rainforest agriculture etc along human habitat support respects would offer first experimental large scale look ecosystems interact insights carbon nitrogen cycles also possible first blueprint recreating earth biosphere space colonization project originally conceived executed group adventurers artists philosophers known synergists backing texas gazillionaire ed bass number enterprises including art gallery london cattle ranch pastoral restoration project australia ranch retreat new mexico oceanic research vessel called heraclitus biosphere heroic effort beautifully constructed private venture designers leaders lot leeway whole experiment would conducted sort people would chosen member crew live sealed ecosystem two years thus crew scientific experience doctor many adventurers lived synergist life sailing world research working outback since two years would isolating require hard physical labor ingenuity technical skills worst people close inside human element remained problematic throughout history biosphere overall success fail goal first biosphere experiment keep darn thing sealed whole two years nothing thermodynamic energy sunlight electronic communications would go everything would recycled case medical emergency airlock created would possible supplies humans go without messing measurements considering first time humans creating complex ecosystem populating everything scorpions microbes coral reefs crops pests success failure balance closure experiment long time seems well ridiculous media biospherians leadership venture viewed goal led fairly interesting decisions along way especially respect health crew turns get another semi starvation experiment prior closure biospherians already working inside biosphere growing crops making sure everything worked etc work crew member responsible agriculture jane poynter predicted would able grow food needed within biosphere actually quite achievement farm acre entirely organic self sufficient chemical fertilizers pesticides poisons sprayed plants would sealed inside biosphere according jane however number acceptable management somehow turned putting crew calorie restricted low fat nutrient dense diet insult added injury fact diet nearly vegan consumed little goat milk meat eggs perhaps week give idea course first year diet sweet potato fat consumed bananas doctor crew roy walford spent much career researching low calorie diets relate longevity perfect experiment unfortunately would die als age publish several papers biopsherian diet one review optimistically titled calorically restricted low fat nutrient dense diet biosphere significantly lowers blood glucose total leukocyte count cholesterol blood pressure humans free full text go take look actually go ahead already scan little post semi starvation wwii go take look perhaps predictable biosphere crop problems crew first six months restricted average calories daily actually weight watchers tm would likely me eat weight loss diet points i think would allotment biopsherians engaged hard physical labor much day carbon dioxide levels rising continuously harvest sequester biomass facility shovel scrape carbonate home made natural co scrubber mention farming harvesting rice paddies threshing wheat milking goats whole shebang glass panels admitted uv light help reptiles survive humans allowed supplementation iu vitamin vitamin folic acid iu vitamin mg vitamin calcium ate three meals day equal portions men women surprisingly biospherians lost weight lots weight men lost bmi months women average systolic blood pressure decreased diastolic bp decreased mean total cholesterol decreased hdl fell dismal risk ratio total cholesterol hdl remained triglycerides decreased men increased women fasting glucose fell much fun crew diet well walford practically mute subject paper one sentence six months sexes body fat composition lower bounds normal reported ill effects enter human experiment two years twenty minutes inside biosphere jane poynton describes hunger fatigue mental fog licking plate rather obsessively elaborate food rituals depression descriptions much remind me rituals book wasted memoir anorexia bulimia p blood pressures described also remind me ones teenage girls child psych unit i worked resident girls due eating disorders quotes jane book however becoming ever obsessed food watching film i would focus eating scenes forgetting plot sometimes lined second story windows habitat took turns peering binoculars fat people everyone seemed overweight even slender people spurting ketchup sausages shoveling mouths culinary voyeurs i dragged myself chore chore taking twice long weed sweet potato field taken skipping chores i used strong vital i felt far time jane notes locked door biosphere door banana room succulent fruit far tempting ca separate diet biospherians low light increasingly low oxygen turns oxygen reacting concrete structure leading gradually continuously lower levels biospherians sleep apnea could complete sentences eventually oxygen piped second year difficulty isolation last months first mission eight crew members split two factions would make eye contact speak unless absolutely necessary apparently one crew set funding psychological monitoring counseling ahead time experiment rejected management frankly baffling considering useful information might say nasa anyone else planning antarctic missions long term space missions mention starving oxygen deprived suffering biospherians running million experiment never would passed institutional review board academic medical center tale biospherians lessons medical science remember semi starvation tough row hoe every time tried
