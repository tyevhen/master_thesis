hi tonight quick basic post necessary background i try make painless possible need examine dopamine closely well dopamine may well secret makes human meaning awfully bright able plan ahead resist impulses necessary dopamine neurotransmitter controls communication brain chemical tell neuron fire signal modulates signals dopamine ancient found lizard brains every animal along evolutionary tree homo sapiens humans great deal dopamine many generations evolved control dopamine ends brain determined straight mendalian genetics i discussed post mothers neurochemical environment lot dopamine machinery migrates works brains another special thing humans bipedalism upright mom pregnant exposes fetal brains different vestibular environments primates theory elevated dopamine levels left hemisphere people brains i know go minute theory humans also eat lot meat fish compared primates meat fish give dopamine precursors dopamine also associated greater competitiveness aggression impulse control one could see particular combination traits would selected human evolution serotonin another neurotransmitter oldest neurotransmitter original antioxidant dopamine made humans successful biochemistry dopamine type neurotransmitter called catecholamine catecholamines surprisingly catechol chemical group attached amine get dopamine eat precursor amino acid protein eat called tyrosine tyrosine becomes dopa via enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase dopa becomes dopamine via actions dopa decarboxylase one chemical reaction turn dopamine best buddy neurotransmitter norepinephrine later case serotonin precursor tryptophan tyrosine cross blood brain barrier dopamine means dopamine brain needs must manufactured dopamine machinery precursors brain still me happens without dopamine screwy dopamine machinery inefficient dopamine well development lack cause mental retardation case rare genetic disease called pku cretinism type mental retardation caused iodine deficiency dopamine problems implicated adhd alzheimer parkinson depression bipolar disorders schizophrenia much dopamine wrong place make psychotic illicit drugs dump loads dopamine strongly inhibit reuptake similar dumping loads dopamine include cocaine methamphetamines therefore high amounts dopamine cause euphoria aggression intense sexual feelings need dopamine right place right time right amounts comes together awesomest ape around problems ensue surprisingly dopamine linked everything interesting metabolism evolution brain feast scientific info hopefully make sense information post taken mostly dopaminergic mind human evolution history fred previc
