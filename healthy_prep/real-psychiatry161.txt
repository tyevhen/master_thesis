harvey cushing md ever since medical errors third leading cause death came media bloggers abuzz headline matter time hear many full crashing would equal number patients killed physician errors year number articles press day algorithms checklists committee government agency eliminate risk medical diagnosis procedures equal number stories machine intelligence eliminate human error story weeks ago robot could suture operative wounds surgery seeing robot action i would want anywhere near me anyone i cared often palpable conflict interest involved news stories stories designed generate interest influence politicians stories express political viewpoint even professional literature much written political viewpoint often develop leverage physicians force things certain way selling point public elected officials medicine particularly physicians would perform better uniformly would adhere certain protocols protocols need include input people never trained physicians notably business managers i illustrate analyses absurd based experience i years ago time wife struggling intense ear pain provider seeing wanted start another course antibiotics ear pain i see ent surgeon instead performed examination ent physician read ct scan ordered ct scan read normal radiologist ent physician read abnormal got additional imaging studies demonstrate wife pituitary tumor referral endocrinologist confirmed growth hormone secreting tumor explaining additional symptoms described various physicians years i went work point found neurosurgeon one pioneers transsphenoidal adenoma resections world although malignant prognosis tumors benign disfigurement acromegaly progressive endocrine abnormalities eventual congestive heart failure effects excessive growth hormone secretion also complications inadequate excision secondary procedures like gamma knife irradiation attempt obliterate tumor sitting consulting room neurosurgeon soon could arrange pulled coronal section mri scan showing tumor wrapped around wife right internal carotid artery made following statement tumor artery pointing areas mri coronal view pituitary gland surrounding anatomy i going try remove much tumor possible i accidentally nick carotid artery area nothing done complication happens i know good neurosurgeons happen i assure i remove much tumor possible i remove much i would remove one family members unspoken truth medical errors whether preventable case nothing results inevitable slow death severely compromised quality life procedure without risk case risk minimized selecting skilled neurosurgeon area openly acknowledges nicking carotid artery place repaired possibility happens best neurosurgeons cursory analysis illustrate talking operation occurs inch space tip endoscope tumor extends away tip small crevice carotid artery sphenoid bone anyone really interested go youtube view several videos procedure view surgeon case neurosurgeon explicitly talked issue much tumor could removed acutely aware risk involved removing much tumor may unacceptably high incompletely removing tumor involves risk continued exposure excessive growth hormone secondary gamma knife procedure fact surgery done seems like miracle me early career i treated patient underwent transtemporal approach kind tumor resulted significant postoperative disability decision proceed wife clearly found risk acceptable acromegaly slow death endocrine complications procedures operative procedure went perfectly years later growth hormone igh levels serial mri scans show tumor recurrence i speculate might gone wrong wife case henry marsh writes compilation neurosurgical complications harm chapter pituitary adenoma transphenoidal procedure man acromegaly description relevant anatomy however two major arteries next pituitary gland surgeon exceptionally unlucky damaged operation patient well post operative day number suddenly right arm paralyzed could communicate brain imaging confirmed major left hemispheric stroke actual operative complications marsh concludes must caused unknowable way operation let take look would happened wife case complication series complications using methodology cited authors studies first case complication chain errors begin misdiagnosis otitis media two antibiotic prescriptions misread ct scan sphenoid bone seems like two preliminary errors right even though neither immediately threatening combined surgical error would three medical errors complication occurred self correcting aspects process ent surgeon get credit correcting misdiagnosis otitis media misreading ct scan focus medical errors never looks self correcting aspects many times caught many times standard second opinions colleagues trusted referrals modify treatment plan much morbidity mortality would occur without level self correction estimated best example i recall problems error determination nejm editorial address first report medical errors institute medicine editorial lead author quoted studies discusses issue definition errors definition preventability subjective nature determinations preliminary analysis iom conclusion deaths caused medical errors create impression warranted scientific work underlying iom report number inflated according recent quoted report also expresses opinion completely consistent marsh observations goes point observation error reliably made third party observers even best surgical technique proper precautions however hemorrhage occur classified postoperative hemorrhages resulting transfer patients back operating room simple procedures hysterectomy appendectomy preventable even though cases apparent blunder slip surgeon iom report refers cases medical errors observers may seem inappropriate goes elaborate four important aspects iom report politics public perception first idea either nothing done safety things getting dangerous many ways analogous public perception violent crime high year low gives even better example harvey cushing accomplishments neurosurgical career mortality rate craniotomies brain tumors twenty years reduced currently without iom current federal state regulators whole idea physicians motivated adhering politicians regulators want rather best interest patients always incredible one me i guess makes sense politician regulator really believe naively designed incentives disincentives meaning second complication increased reporting requirements complications involves including impact confidential peer reviewed complications every physician participated form complications conferences surgeons used call morbidity mortality conferences modern goal conferences try identify procedures interventions improve patients safety opening system increased reporting subjecting dead weight litigation system something author cautions often explicit news headlines makary thought iom missed boat issue malpractice litigation risk internally driven safety initiatives i think subsequent authors missed boat issue biological variability degree addressed subjective determination preventability entirely neurosurgeon observed performed errorless operation patient sustains significant complications factors go calling error lot may due baseline state patient already compromised injury illness congenital variations neurosurgeons operating healthy people example also applies medicine psychiatry example i usually tell people front days chance noticeably improve antidepressant symptoms significant another chance feel somewhat better get back baseline state chance get significant side effects want continue medication small number cases chance really severe side effects medication pharmacogenomics suggests invaluable process variability predictions using available analyses manufacturer manufacturers even warning number people consider error received medication caused get rash worst case serotonin syndrome i think natural tendency see medical procedure go well attributable error part physician i think personal experience physicians bear another less well known intervention psychiatry care chronically suicidal person many persons history serious suicide attempts remain significant risk usual risk factor analysis suicide potential add much frequently inadequate resources treat refuse access available frequent short term admissions inpatient units adds nothing care psychiatrist accepts care usually seeing intensely accepting crisis calls patients sufficient therapeutic alliance develops may many sessions lot depression anger little objective information patient thinking psychiatrist patient case need accept risk involved situation suicide suicide attempt necessary make progress enhance patient ability function enjoy life main point people currently need assume risks order get better nobody physicians would want medicine risk endeavor reality going happen anytime soon patients realize level may little mitigate anger disappointment occurs every family tale tell medical miracle medical mistake situations like wife faced support people clearly willing take risk face undesirable consequences physicians involved see serious work classification medical errors refined analyzed course approach used press invoking planes full patients sent death physicians equated terrorists accurate helpful backlash significant impairs ongoing error analysis correction process equating heterogenous collection complications classified different methods errors listing standard cause death also accurate helpful science medical error analysis
