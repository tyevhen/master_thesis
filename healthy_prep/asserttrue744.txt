i like things go fast includes code runs fast javascript java challenge much better though i like challenges someone asks me single best way speed slow script naturally i want know script spending time browser scripting typical slow script operation either involves tedious string parsing kind dom operations count programmer insanity sorts things like creating regular expression object loop two important pieces advice i give speeding browser scripts never hand parse string dom operations loops general dom operations means things like crawl big long string using indexof tokenize go instead use replace split join technique technique basically effect moving loop native routine inside interpreter general approach discussed previous post example would hit highlighting long run text step text looking terms question use replace means avoid looping return values getelementsbytagname fact call unless get away lot createelement appendchild types things especially loops especially functions get called lot event handlers mouse movements use innerhtml wherever possible words create nodes strings markup slam final string dom last minute setting parent node innerhtml value moves dom reconfiguring browser native dom routines happen speed compiled sit rebuild dom brick brick javascript unless seldom techniques avoiding big speedups situational i still learning course i still trying find lazily invoked big speed hit operations gecko suddenly triggered scripts situational speed hits sometimes addressed caching expensive objects reuse expensive results technique known memoization good article mozilla folks put lot work speeding javascript runtimes remember fastest runtime environment world brought knees poor choice algorithms obviously always possible employ two techniques mentioned certain cases performance gain impressive general remain underutilized techniques i tell i bring additional techniques speeding javascript means leave comment i interested hearing experiences
