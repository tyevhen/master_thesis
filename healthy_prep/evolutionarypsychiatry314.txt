found two studies measuring diet pattern mood disorders first one dietary pattern depressive symptoms middle age british journal psychiatry free full text go take look paper part large whitehall ii epidemiological study people screened baseline phase sorts demographic characteristics stress levels health lifestyle factors blood pressure labwork every years study subjects received postal questionnaire fill phases every years questionnaire clinical examination done phases paper data taken white european participants data dietary patterns covariates phase depression phase black asian participants excluded due differences eating patterns dietary pattern determined food frequency questionnaire based one used nurses health study changed include british sorts foods like bangers mash crisps yorkshire pudding good write addressing actually rather rigorous still hopeless validity ffq used nurses health study food items rated according often consumed never less per month six times per day items divided groups dietary patterns identified using principal component analysis groups statisticians gleefully addressed data graphs scree plots tweaks nudges score pops person diet falling whole foods processed foods patterns whole foods diets consisting vegetables fruits fish processed foods diets consisting high consumption sweetened desserts chocolates fried food processed meat pies refined grains high fat dairy products condiments depression measures determined question center epidemiologic studies depression scale people score higher considered depressed statisticians got whack data adjusting covariates age gender marital status employment grade education smoking physical activity health status based clinical findings high hemoglobin ac measure average blood glucose blood pressure antidepressants etc second ghq depression subscale cognitive score based question test ready results yet think turn patients highest intake whole foods less likely depressed association affected much actually adjusting covariates interesting suggesting association diet could important important covariates patients high intake processed food much likely depressed another interesting thing study see data know whether depressed people blue anything sit around gorging meat pies sugar refined grains diet actually leads depression depression measures repeated phase phase participants depressed stage excluded data showed people crappy diets depressed yet phase likely depressed phase addition researchers went back phase data found evidence dietary patterns phase worse participants depressed phase clues crappy diet precedes depressive symptoms way around rather cool study considering limitations epidemiology second study hot presses diet quality bipolar disorder population based sample women journal affective disorders i think november issue corrected proofs available online print subjects used women australian geelong osteoporosis study i blogged back june women randomly recruited compulsory voting roles volunteered particular piece study women given gold standard interview diagnosis psychiatric disorders scid non patient edition patients depression anxiety excluded allowing patients bipolar disorder compared current lifetime psychopathology food frequency questionnaire used diets broken traditional vegetables fruit beef lamb fish whole grains western meat pies processed meats pizza chips hamburgers white bread sugar flavored milk drinks beer modern fruits salads fish yogurt nuts beans tofu red wine blah blah blah logistic regression analyses exposure variables studiously applied accounted tell i epidemiologist interesting tidbit i remember previous paper i blogged june researchers note absolute amount western style foods seemed related risk depression rather amount proportion overall energy consumption therefore researchers examined data grouping absolute amounts percentage energy covariate confounding whew bipolar disorder less common depressive anxiety disorders women whole study qualified diagnosis depression anxiety therefore excluded analysis without depressive anxiety disorders participants bipolar disorder younger higher average daily energy intake though difference education bmi alcohol intake education socioeconomic status smoking physical activity compared psychopathology interesting bipolar disorder substance abuse highly correlated something keep mind bipolar ladies seem smoke drink normals diet results individuals modern pattern likely diagnosis bipolar disorder individuals western pattern adjustments energy intake traditional dietary pattern protective data held even accounting age previous study i addressed comments previous blog post diets also given total dqs dietary quality score associated close diets came national recommendations good diets similar usda recommendations dqs score diets correlation bipolar disorder protective protective overall authors noted i association depressive anxiety bipolar disorders similar traditional diet protective modern western diets similarly dismal theory individual response diet would based genetic risk inflammation level related similar dietary choices would come different psychopathology depending genes authors second study make note results first study i mentioned think diet causative choice result specific psychiatric illness note systemic inflammation oxidative stress neurotrophin levels potential explanations demonstrated associations dietary quality bipolar disorder i agree wholeheartedly eat real food folks wo hurt maybe help
