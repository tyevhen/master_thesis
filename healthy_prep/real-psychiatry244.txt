question strike fear hearts psychiatrists everywhere spend practically day sitting i easily spend hours days week sitting chair another hours weekend time comfortable sounds certainly require great deal physical exertion situation got worse placement computer terminals every office i first started working i would walk hallway randomly glance office doors order look busy people offices would typically stare paper papers desk hands everyone staring obligatory computer screen i wo digress massive problems associated computerized model point people immobilized several years ago i started see stories people exercising work i remember first story showed office person desk lost significant amount weight walking mph treadmill worked phones used computer followed idea healthier stand day sit suddenly people clinic standing work instead sitting i started see news stories suggesting dangerous person sit work sitting work could actually lead shorter life could kill type news stories lead immediate search memories see could possibly true face validity hidden epidemic deaths due gasp sitting i rapidly dismissed idea combination marketing hysteria stories persisted article reputable clinic described enzyme activation changed sitting standing position effect metabolism usual concept public consumption higher metabolic rates lead calories burned weight loss appeals american obsessions calories food appearance weight loss easy way trick metabolism burning calories i ate today hack easy standing work day i decided take two pronged approach look problem review whole idea activity monitoring examine available literature following graphic display garmin vivofit activity tracker tracker plots activity terms steps walking slowly count steps setup phase asks select fitness level plots number steps per day based level choose height weight i chose level percentile steps per day far much problem especially i work campus requires fair amount walking step plot tells part story i also cycled miles today really indicated hour hour plots steps notice red zones graphs tracker emits soft beeping sound extending red bar across display idle hour get expend steps cancel visual alarm overriding question whether warning inactivity valid especially case guy biked miles day graphic cycling illustrated may readily apparent time i cycling activity monitor went mysterious mode counting steps nearly enough account covering miles put green mark line indicating high activity period i make great example immobilized white collar worker counters problem lot exercise away work i go endeavor eyes wide open i see guy thought going live longer anyone else i already experienced attitude one day i walking hallway eating granola bar one colleagues came me said think going live longer me using socratic method get unconscious motivations eating granola bar i tried emphasize sometimes granola bar people like me happen like way taste buying idea i keel i apologize advance widow hope family understand i present data best intentions i think good data involves actual measurements rather usual epidemiological data studies provide i sitting behind desk least hours day past years time i exercise stress tests one stress echocardiogram ct scan heart negative ct scan heart calcium score first years period i cycling miles per week months may october either riding equivalent time indoor trainer speedskating rest year last ten years mileage figure gone miles per week additional strength training new sedentary science early data well summarized review proper et al authors reviewed quality evidence concluded evidence strong cause cardiovascular mortality moderate diabetes mellitus type poor body weight bmi obesity waist circumference endometrial cancer detailed epidemiological study five different categories sitting time interesting showed correlation sitting time dose mortality showed effect persisted even controlled bmi smoking status activity level sitting suggested mechanisms included lipoprotein lipase activity effect sedentary cardiac stroke volume output effect lipoprotein lipase activity trivial one study showing activity restriction resulted fold elevation decrease lipoprotein lipase activity red oxidative muscle fibers subsequent studies show breaking sitting time expected positive effects metabolic markers including triglycerides waist circumference fasting blood glucose recent studies looked measures endothelial function demonstrated measurable decline hours sitting countered walking minutes mph every hour replicated important implications office workers think need stand walk treadmill continuously order prevent problems associated sedentary work environment also implications kinds exercise recommend patients prevention metabolic syndrome cardiovascular disease although i aware clear guidelines may mean point sedentary patients may need get move around low intensity manner hourly basis plan high intensity exercise least day also implications patients see moving much significantly abnormal lipids profiles like people admitted hospitals residential treatment centers immobilized weeks months may mean medical therapy dyslipidemia necessary patient moving may also implications cognitive dysfunction noted many psychiatric diagnoses past year i saw roger mcintyre md present data cognitive problems bipolar disorder major depression patients correlated obesity metabolic syndrome impaired executive function persisted periods euthymia interventions impact metabolic factors may effect improving cognition recent review takes look variables may important types exercise used break prolonged sitting times preliminary take data sitting may dangerous health especially bmi high risk factors many studies effect size sitting seem relatively robust independent risk factors measurements rapidly deteriorating endothelial function period hours raises lot questions example people going sleeping least hours per night equivalent amount deterioration time period protective mechanisms sleep prevent problem review classifies sleep sedentary behavior raise energy level substantially rest idea periods need broken low level exercise every hour optimal times exercises validation studies measures seem daunting finally technology obvious i posted primitive stage different manufacturers marketing different features one manufacturer device claims wake non rem sleep morning i chose device one one year battery life practically every equivalent fitness monitor battery lasted days i could use monitor tracks steps guess current device picks accelerations based fact characterized mile bike ride high activity gave me negligible number steps also needs better job detecting sleep instead using specified sleep hours way count inactivity best example attempts catch sleep saturday sunday mornings counted inactivity finally i logging manufacturer web site log activity devices i purchased interface good job integrating data logical manner showing relevant scientific parameters references would hurt i understand move using software personal computer step away domination internet cloud enamored device companies i ca imagine market best possible display data things considered looks like might something one colleagues stated opinion devices might useful people much exercise separate effect sedentary metabolism prevents getting effects high intensity exercise reports long time endurance athletes high intensity athletes either sustaining heart attacks clear coronary artery disease angiography basic study i could find effect interrupted sitting lipid profiles bmi would difficult study effort would take community sample i add activity monitoring exercise routines see i learn
