freud biological roots project scientific psychology immediately completing studies hysteria breuer freud undertook one ambitious projects formulation psychology neurologists comprising three notebooks two contained manuscript pages freud project scientific psychology probably clearest statement desire establish neurobiological model mind explaining purposes project opening chapter freud wrote intention furnish psychology shall natural science represent psychical processes quantitatively determinate states specifiable material particles thus making processes perspicuous free contradiction emphasis added content project ambitious freud proposed three separate systems neuronal activity account varying functions perception memory consciousness also proposed neurophysiological models ego functions cognition judgment recall etc sleep dream states hallucinatory hysterical states despite rather formidable accomplishments freud failed one area interested discovery biological model repression wanted achieve nothing short comprehensive physiological explanation precise neurological chemical details repression since viewed problems defense repression core riddle inability solve riddle constituted major professional loss writing friend fleiss first two notebooks project freud lamented third one dealt longed mechanical explanation neurosis hanging together freud abandoned project altogether failure triggered decisive turning point career ruefully abandoned unattainable biological laws accessible less disputable psychological concepts wrote point onwards i shall venture leave unanswered question finding mechanical representation biological rules perhaps end i may content myself clinical explanation neurosis precisely freud proceeded
