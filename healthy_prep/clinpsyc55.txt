post details duplicate publication data antidepressant duloxetine cymbalta marketing science collide produce hideous offspring experimercial pimps lilly bogus depression hurts marketing cymbalta using exact weak data twice data published journal clinical psychiatry jcp data published second time journal psychiatric research jpr blatant violation jpr policy oh alan schatzberg president elect american psychiatric association involved story study lilly conducted rather uninteresting study cymbalta patients shown treatment response ssri assigned either direct switch switch cymbalta immediately discontinue ssri medication start taper switch taper ssri week period also starting cymbalta note control group sort issue authors dance around i essentially ignore papers based study data publication journal clinical psychiatry data study published january issue journal clinical psychiatry findings essence notable differences patients directly switched cymbalta opposed start taper switch method authors conclude despite lack control group authors get message depression improved painful physical symptoms anyone television probably noticed lilly pushing hard quite time convince patients physicians cymbalta relieve depression pain depressed patients marketing points pushed one journal pimp idea using data another journal publication journal psychiatric research data study published online appear print soon journal psychiatric research jpr i mean exact data appear paper huge scientific findings supposed published journals struggling find space new interesting findings need waste space duplicate data fact quote jpr website submission paper journal psychiatric research understood imply original paper previously published considered publication elsewhere prior publication abstract form indicated furthermore authors upload copies related manuscript recently published press consideration elsewhere following circumstances indicate paper related manuscript submitted journal overlap results presented overlap subjects patients materials results based pretty clear submit data already published figure journal clinical psychiatry jcp article mentioned data figure jpr wait beginning data tables jcp right side half table jcp exact data appearing jpr fair researchers jpr reported data subscales two measures reported jcp vast majority data reprinted article jcp completely trouncing journal policy importantly conveying lilly marketing messages audiences two different journals unfortunately apparently consider people might actually read journals notice essentially article appeared twice lilly considered prospect said cares i leave readers decide care authors jcp paper authored david perahia deborah quail derisala desaiah emmanuele corruble maurizio fava jpr paper authored perahia quail desaiah angel montejo alan schaztberg publish data corruble fava montejo schatzberg schatzberg almost jpr describes contributions author two authors schatzberg montejo credited jcp paper described involved data review interpretation including development manuscript could involved data review interpretation vast majority data already analyzed interpreted written researchers jcp paper write paper apparently since jpr article mentioned dr desaiah worked dr perahia draft manuscript montejo schatzberg could conceivably played significant role data analysis interpretation writing paper seems desaiah perahia drafted manuscript montejo schatzberg could done maybe review paper schatzberg paper well happens i sure sheer coincidence schatzberg co editor chief jpr good position help paper essentially republishes data jcp minor additions make publication journal policies nice work schatzberg pimpin hard friend worthy nomination coveted golden goblet award congratulations first time schatzberg scientific behavior noted stumping face much contradictory data favor pet drug ru corlux treatment psychotic depression time bad science surrounding corlux schaztberg myriad conflicts interest much written add another chapter chronicles storied american psychiatric association leader reminds me earlier incident involving charles nemeroff discussion i noted previously discussion section journal article often contains key marketing points science relegated secondary status best jpr article provides good examples cymbalta talking points current paper focuses pain related outcomes demonstrating switch ssri non partial responders duloxetine associated significant improvement pain measures including six vas pain scales sq ss pain subscale sf bodily pain domain switch ssri non partial responders duloxetine resulted mean improvements pain measures regardless switch method used duloxetine snri previously shown effective treatment

reported studies demonstrating duloxetine efficacy pain either part depression part chronic pain condition dpnp i start mentioning jpr states discussion results study placed appropriate context knowledge discussion limitations implications future work maybe research questions lilly talking points cymbalta relieving pain depression research discussed well happens research analyzed lilly clinical trials found cymbalta better placebo paxil treating pain depression meta analysis cymbalta trials published january yet jpr article originally received jpr march mention negative data hmmm exactly sound like placing findings appropriate context knowledge talk cymbalta fantastic analgesic effects despite lilly data showing cymbalta best close useless treating pain among depressed patients another study claimed show cymbalta helluva painkiller also smacked letter editor months ago authors lilly sponsored trial conceded defeat refusing reply critiques study better weak ssris really jpr study mentioned evidence ssris treating pain weak disagreement end see ssri patients switched cymbalta pain magically went away cymbalta unlike ssris relieves pain never mind lack control group allotted grand total words discussion potential limitation study authors also failed note prior research showed cymbalta better paxil treating pain depressed patients perahia lead author jcp jpr studies certainly aware research showing cymbalta works better weak ssri since lead author one study quite aware cymbalta never shown superior paxil treating pain yet accurately describes research indicating ssris weak pain treatments neglects mention cymbalta failed demonstrate superiority paxil treating pain depression called lying omission i may pass along concerns journal psychiatric research prior experiences passing along concerns journals via blog identity either ignore concerns entirely instruct me write letter editor would considered publication stipulation i use real identity sorry published letter editor worth blowing cover call action rather running point last paragraph one scientifically inclined readers submit concerns journal following condition make sure read original papers first judge concerns valid feel similarly send letter editor bad science nothing advance patient care seeks advance sales cymbalta pimping painkiller depression ignoring contradictory data let try little research see jpr willing address issues swept rug reference jpr article perahia quail desaiah montejo schatzberg switching duloxetine selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor non partial responders effects painful physical symptoms depression journal psychiatric research doi jpsychires update also see excellent follow post topic bad science
