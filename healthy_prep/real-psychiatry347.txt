people certainly know spin drug studies debate old versus new typical versus atypical antipsychotics always seems contain element marketing somebody pushing agenda reality analyses always lacking spin issue older antipsychotics haloperidol fluphenazine versus newer risperidone paliperidone problematic especially conclusion reason use newer second third generation antipsychotics also points difference clinical experience clinical trials clinical experience often minimized anecdotal point anecdotal becomes statistically significant experience typical first generation antipsychotics neurological side effects looking results drug trials might interesting look agendas various parties involved certainly pharmaceutical manufacturers want products look good possible also clear agendas part investigators even financial conflict interest eliminated investigators view schizophrenia largely disorder adequately treated antipsychotic medication medication adherence big part treatment certainly one interest idea intramuscular injections best way another i recall listening investigators talk good patient painful would psychiatrist recommend injectable medication soon shown medication tolerated oral form seem suggest patient would actually want injection experience nobody would want take monthly painful intramuscular im injections foreseeable future i seen people come conclusion need accumulate significant amount equally painful evidence related missing oral doses medication argument long acting injectables take new dimension availability long acting naltrexone vivitrol injections medication one approach treatment opioid use disorders effective people opioids produce expected euphoria incentive keep taking also reduces rate accidental opioid overdose following detoxification many people taken medications using high doses time discharge real risk many attempt go back using amount opioids using tolerance gone creates potential opioid overdose death nature addiction prevent many people using substitution therapies like buprenorphine methadone long acting naltrexone injections painful many people opioid addiction realize best chance stop ongoing addiction avoid complications overdose including death treatment schizophrenia spectrum disorders many patients never get level risk benefit analysis translates even lower likelihood appreciating advantages long acting injectable medication neurological side effects older antipsychotics usually ignored minimized debate old versus new medications largest single side effect problem facing psychiatrists years ago would common look group hospitalized patients notice tardive dyskinesia commonest movement disorder caused older antipsychotic medications i recall experience stabilizing people severe bipolar disorder antipsychotic medication mood stabilizer time came back see me clinic developed tardive dyskinesia movement disorder like akathisia drug induced parkinson syndrome worst case scenario movement disorder would completely resolve modification therapy discontinuation antipsychotic medication treatment tardive dyskinesia developed problematic anyone continues need medication clozapine treatment choice clozapine highly regarded experts treating schizophrenia use treatment resistant cases protective effects suicide use movement disorders experts often suggest used soon enough front line clinicians unique set liabilities terms metabolic cardiac side effects need white blood cell monitoring duration use technically medication dispensed patient unless absolute neutrophil count known exact days suggested protocol drug induced movement disorders much cosmetic problem depending sensitivity medication although rarely happens i treated patients psychosis severe drug induced tardive syndromes identical severe parkinson disease continued severe symptoms psychosis i would typically see patients movement disorders interest area i seeing large number severe cases even rare cases movement disorder related disability leave impression i low threshold discontinuing antipsychotic medication would use antipsychotic medication another option available best case point current practice augmenting antidepressant medications atypical antipsychotic i used augmentation strategies options exhausted patient educated potential problems even risk pateint follow reporting problems stopping medication effect movements catie clinical antipsychotic trials intervention effectiveness study published new england journal medicine responsible minimization fact newer antipsychotic agents much better neurological side effect profile major therapeutic advance read study authors sensitive issue comparison studies atypical antipsychotics doses typical antipsychotic haloperidol designed bias neurological side effect results toward newer medications haloperidol potent antipsychotic medication significant neurological side effects even low doses study authors chose perphenazine older antipsychotic medication moderate side effect profile perphenazine also received special treatment study indicated following excerpts body paper patients initially randomly assigned receive olanzapine perphenazine quetiapine risperidone double blind conditions followed months treatment discontinued reason phase patients current tardive dyskinesia could enroll randomization scheme prevented assignment treatment perphenazine two hundred thirty one patients tardive dyskinesia excluded random assignment perphenazine moreover patients discontinued olanzapine owing weight gain metabolic effects percent vs percent percent four drugs p patients discontinued perphenazine owing extrapyramidal effects percent vs percent percent p dose range perphenazine chosen minimize potential extrapyramidal symptoms may biased previous comparisons first second generation drugs use low dose perphenazine appears diminished frequency extrapyramidal side effects patients received first generation drug contrast previous studies proportion patients extrapyramidal symptoms differ significantly among received first generation second generation drugs study despite finding patients discontinued perphenazine medications owing extrapyramidal effects effectiveness study measured time medication discontinuation primary measure clinincal global impression cgi scale positive negative syndrome scale panss time medication discontinuation olanzapine significantly better perphenazine differences admittedly crude secondary measures measures efficacy perphenazine appeared good questiapine ziprasidone risperidone actual study results catie widely interpreted older antipsychotics good newer antipsychotics usual conspiracy theories pharmaceutical companies making billions new drugs better old drugs play grist popular press subtext gullible greedy psychiatrists duped concerning lead prescriptions perpehanazine pharmaceutical beneift managers used opportunity suggest newer antipsychotics used typical antipsychotic medications bee tried even cursory reading catie excerpts suggest researchers attempted compensate tendency perphenazine cause neurological side effects even could prevent clearly want anyone tardive dyskinesia take perphenazine personally practiced time statements make perfect sense me people expertise experience always come sensational theory headline one reason another nobody doubt newer antipsychotic agents significant therapeutic advance terms neurological side effects expert i think reason i would prescribe first generation antipsychotic i still see opinions using chlorpromazine sleep psychiatric conditions first generation antipsychotics prescribed human beings low frequency use keeps fda pulling market i digressed issue neurological side effects one main contentions goff editorial typical versus atypical long acting injections describes difference akathisia tardive dyskinesia haoloperidol versus paliperidone groups despite ample qualifiers suggest side effect profiles guide medication selection actual study mcevoy haloperidol low end dosing spectrum lead significantly neurological side effects treatment discontinuations due neurologic adverse effects according clinician judgment follows patients haloperidol decanoate group vs paliperidone palmitate group due akathisia haloperidol decanoate group vs paliperidone palmitate group due parkinsonism haloperidol decanoate group vs paliperidone palmitate group due tardive dyskinesia study also borrows logic catie study discussing neurological side effects contrary expectations statistically significant advantage paliperidone palmitate compared haloperidol decanoate ratings severity abnormal involuntary movements parkinsonism incidence tardive dyskinesia however ratings severity akathisia increased haloperidol decanoate medications manage akathisia parkinsonism started patients haloperidol decanoate group partially confirming paliperidone palmitate lower propensity cause extrapyramidal symptoms haloperidol decanoate might statistical significance relevant interesting aspect mcevoy paper references randomized clinical trials showing long acting injectable medications add nothing terms reducing frequency hospitalization useful fact compared experts claim otherwise study catie study highlight couple problems medication focused research first medication focus intense researcher stake approach prescribing rigorous average clinician average clinicians check prolactin levels usually indication typically call intensive intervention treat side effect whenever i look samples hundreds people i know metabolism drug sample going uniform accounts lot neurological side effects given reasonable costs therapeutic drug monitoring curious never done trials unlike observation prolactin levels could result something actually done like lowering dose medication second interventions prevent complications incorporated clinical trials mcevoy study patients coached metabolic syndrome strategies prevent weight gain past point informed consent idea observing effect medication alone enough days human subjects committees start introducing idea neurological side effects treated medication metabolic side effects bottom line me reason prescribing first generation antipsychotics unless person stable years experiencing side effects comparisons academic purposes interesting lead misinterpretations media managed care entities psychopharmacology trials remain fairly primitive blunt instrument compared clinical
