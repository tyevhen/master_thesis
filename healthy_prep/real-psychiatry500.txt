apa came press release today response president obama initiative reduce gun violence prevent future mass shootings although release applauds proposals seem short mental health side apa release heartened administration plans finalize rules governing mental health parity mental health parity addiction equity affordable care medicaid strongly urge administration close loopholes involving called non quantitative treatment limits ensure health plans deliver full scope mental health services order comply law action best ensure americans get full range mental health services believe intended receive federal law i guess apa applauding initiative encouraging closing loopholes call me skeptic years rationing mental health services cutting bone managed care intermediaries aggregating managed care intermediaries accountable care organizations bode well full range mental health services apa seems na position support managed care tactics provide increased access quality mental health services next point apa release supports school screening enhanced mental health services schools violence prevention identify children risk need current mental health services certainly laudable goals minimal evidence screening effective also problem lack infrastructure twenty years rationing restricting access psychiatric services resulted long waiting lists completely unavailable services talk child psychiatrist tell current system set offer medications place comprehensive approach psychiatric treatment social services level residential treatment children severe problems practically nonexistent recent example i informed last week school social worker could get child assessed admission adolescent psychiatric unit possible could get appointment see psychiatrist major metropolitan area screening problems make sense unless infrastructure available address problems found final point apa release addresses issue physicians able discuss firearms home patients standard intervention physicians ever since i practicing always part assessment suicide homicide risk state initiative last year making illegal physicians discuss firearms home patients part rationale law could result firearm owners identified placed theoretical risk firearms confiscated state i say experience discussions patients firearm safety discussions physicians i aware highly productive probably saved countless lives best example i think talking primary care physician asked me take look closet full firearms convinced patients turn years turned police patients depressed suicidal high risk impulsive acts would able make intervention gag law place preventing discussions president original release instances word mental usually mental illness mental health noted received accolades apa members mental health community elicited strong poorly thought response nra produced youtube video accusing president elitist hypocrite daughters armed security expected everyone else kids would protected gun free zones white house responded quickly americans agree president children used pawns political fight said jay carney white house press secretary go far make safety president children subject attack ad repugnant cowardly full text white house page document located link ambitious covers lot ground terms specific regulation firearms school safety increasing mental health services firearm regulation specific closes background check loopholes bans assault weapons outlaws armor piercing bullets sets maximum magazine size cartridges part document call congress clear me much accomplished president executive orders opposed congressional action i reminded nra president last weekend stating congress would never pass ban assault weapons executive order section part document lists following activities addressing unnecessary legal barriers health laws prevent states making information available prohibited guns improving incentives states share information system ensuring federal agencies share relevant information system directing attorney general work agencies review laws make sure effective identifying dangerous untrustworthy individuals access guns school safety initiative seems nebulous funding school resource officers school based mental health professionals recommendation train additional social workers counselors psychologists considering fact probably close schools seems like drop bucket ensuring school emergency plan contingencies like mass shootings seem novel idea creating safer school climates reducing bullying already initiated many school districts seems clear lack public health measures school would reduce likelihood violent events mental health initiative equally lacking addition deficiencies i pointed initially document discussion providing mental health training teachers school staff probably evidence teachers school staff may identify mental illness rather identify really problem level screening effective document describes initiative increasing access mental health services screening larger numbers students identifying potential problems actually creates bottleneck system rather increasing access suggested mental health interventions document fall short terms primary secondary prevention mental illness associated aggressive behavior depending managed care model established track record dismantling mental health infrastructure providing limited access poor quality care nothing accommodate increasing referrals assure referred students rapidly medicated final analysis president initiative today may starting point certainly taking issue seriously deserves plenty credit support reopening firearm safety research closed gun lobby important become firearm regulation anyone guess point school mental health initiatives largely symbolic i would expect impact sorely needed american psychiatric association coming standards quality guidelines medical education initiatives improve care people severe mental illnesses also happen aggressive important piece guidelines include public health measures previously mentioned blog measures also play much larger role executive initiative george dawson md dfapa
