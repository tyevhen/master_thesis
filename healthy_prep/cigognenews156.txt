beat body temperature interact people physiological psychological affects simply happened normal loving childbirth kr right make critical distinction word love talking romance even best intentions mother father matter would toward unborn child putting love domain need biological need fetal biological need discreet window anything would want elaborate meant fetal needs absolutely must met time
