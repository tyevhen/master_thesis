yesterday i talked favorite technique crunching data browser generally i try get data tab delimited form save plain old text file i open text file chrome use control shift pop open console window load data variable alldata document getelementsbytagname pre innerhtml data tab delimited well think way data delimited question delimitation scheme whether consistent way javascript offers many ways parse data limited understanding data javascript bottom line data parsed matter finding patterns let go quick example using bio data day i talked pulling codon tables genomevolution org i eventually stuffed bunch data text file data looked like ccap ccgp cctp cccp cgar cggr cgtr cgcr caaq cagq cath cach ctal ctgl cttl ctcl gcaa gcga gcta gcca ggag gggg ggtg ggcg gaae gage gatd gacd gtav gtgv gttv gtcv acat acgt actt acct agar aggr agts agcs aaak aagk aatn aacn atai atgm atti atci tcas tcgs tcts tccs tga tggw tgtc tgcc taa tag taty tacy ttal ttgl tttf ttcf ccap ccgp cctp cccp cgar cggr cgtr cgcr caaq cagq cath cach ctal ctgl cttl ctcl gcaa gcga gcta gcca ggag gggg ggtg ggcg gaae gage gatd gacd gtav gtgv gttv gtcv acat acgt actt acct agar aggr agts agcs aaak aagk aatn aacn atai atgm atti atci tcas tcgs tcts tccs tga tggw tgtc tgcc taa tag taty tacy ttal ttgl tttf ttcf plus much like lots lots codon tables lots lots organisms parse since carriage return end table end line table getting array tables requires codontables allthetext split biogeek big chunk molecular biology nutshell dna four letter language spelling three letter words called codons math possible codons codon corresponds amino acid living organisms fact codons amino acids means amino acids one codon also three codons special meaning codons tag tga taa called stop codons code amino acid instead tell rna polymerase stop making protein codon table organism tells usage frequency possible codons frequencies see vary lot within single codon table single organism across organisms organisms dna unusually high guanine cytosine organisms tend surprisingly use codons containing mostly organisms like botulinum yes botulinum dna contains hardly hence use codon aaa stands lysine good deal say gcg alanine know tables frequencies occurrence codons contain 'a caa cca aaa aat aga etc simple matter sum 'a frequencies get total frequency occurrence organism dna least coding regions dna also get frequencies routine looks codon table entries derives compositions dna function getbasecomposition table var codons table split parse table individual codons freqs codons pop get rid empty final item var bases new object bases bases bases bases function analyze item var percent item split get percentage var codon item substring get actual codon bases codon percent base bases codon percent base bases codon percent wobble base codons foreach analyze loop codons bases normalize frequencies bases bases bases return bases line codons table split chops codon table bunch pieces look like ccap codon followed one letter amino acid abbreviation parens followed frequency number character happens convenient parse presence end table also means split creates empty item end array want get rid empty item pop parsing ccap codon frequency number easy get codon take first three characters string using item substring get number end split space using item split bracketed end means give me second item array created split first item array index would course ccap note normalize frequencies divide toward end looking frequency percentages add counting bases per frequency number codons bases hence normalize going end total base content instead internal method analyze callback give foreach method codons array case realize javascript built foreach method part every array object modern browsers support run code first codon table shown happens organism named abiotrophia defectiva strain atcc get back object fields containing overall frequencies occurrence bases defectiva dna least parts dna code protein well i got chrome console looked like object percentage organism comes me interesting number two base compositions match equal even close fact equal theory equal according chargaff second parity rule applies single stranded dna remember dealing ssdna looking codon values correspond sequences rna synonymous strand organism dna obviously chargaff second parity rule hold case almost twice moreover equals meaning purine content according chargaff second rule purines pyrimidines case things get really fun comes time graph data crunch console window thinking google charts think much easier powerful way graph data involve excel i tell next post
