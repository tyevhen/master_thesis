i encountered paper week me nostalgic old days american psychiatry days people treated hospitals point symptoms remitted discharged course depends couple assumptions first symptoms treated point number people disease process treated point neurodegenerative disorders like alzheimer disease vascular dementia good examples also number people known brain insult yet treatment resistant depression psychosis symptoms respond poorly respond treatment second assumption person illness recognizes need hospital form intensive treatment agree stay long enough one complicated assumptions psychiatry almost exclusively medical specialty treating physician disagree patient preference discharge put hold pending judge decision order stay hospital longer court decision states depends three standards danger self danger others general ability care oneself three standards condensed years single word dangerousness practically inpatient treatment units united states impacted managed care companies would generally like people discharged days irrespective diagnosis treatment plan de facto discharge criteria dangerousness reading first time may sound absurd base medical decision oversimplified legal standard designed unduly impact civil liberty citizens definitely absurd number reasons work inpatient settings carefully crafted treatment plan restore person previous level functioning tolerate managed care case manager physician ask dangerousness dangerousness expectation patient discharged treating physician disagree insurance company via review stop paying hospitalization practical result politics partially stabilized patient discharged would bad news person dangerous nobody talks probably worse first vast majority people psychiatrists treat inpatient units dangerous difficult time functioning terms symptom management need manage life every day partially treated likely able follow detailed treatment plan managed care companies usual critics psychiatry frequently rationalize process global statements like outcomes different inpatient treatment especially involuntary inpatients treatment necessary problem studies look process interest continuing discharge
