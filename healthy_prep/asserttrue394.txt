recap desktop science experiments last month i found strandwise dna asymmetry across domains say bacteria archaea eukaryotes viruses mitochondrial dna every case except mitochondria message rna synonymous strand dna coding regions tends purine rich opposite strand tends pyrimidine rich moreover domains including mitochondria message strand purine content increases proportion genome content content phylogenetic signature genomes inherently high content low content others related organisms tend similar contents mitochondrial genes tend pyrmidine rich message strand seemingly violation finding domains message strands purine rich mitochondrial anomaly actually easy understand although took me weeks realize explanation nutshell mitochondrial dna pyrimidine rich message strands mtdna encodes proteins usually membrane associated membrane associated proteins unusual tend incorporate mostly non polar amino acids leucine isoleucine valine proline alanine phenylalanine specified pyrimidine rich codons mitochondrion seems me mitochondrial dna thought genome well mitochondrial associated gene products encoded genes host nucleus humans may many nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes point worth repeating let me quote patrick chinnery trends genetics vast majority mitochondrial proteins estimated synthesized cytosol nuclear gene transcripts circular mitochondrial chromosome called vestigial remnant much larger genome long ago migrated host nucleus doubt avoid oxidative attack mitochondrion simply safe place store dna would set sperm bank rocket fuel factory teeming molecular oxygen superoxides peroxides free protons hazardous materials human mitochondrial chromosome human mitochondrial dna typical lot mtdna encodes handful multi subnit transmembrane proteins namely cytochrome oxidase nadh dehydrogenase cytochrome atpase protein genes human mtdna mitochondrial proteins encoded somewhere else includes subunits nadh dehydrogenase complex dna polymerase replicates mitochondrial dna mitochondrial rna polymerase ribosomal proteins called mitochondrial catalase hundreds mitochondrial proteins encoded nucleus bottom line mitochondrial dna encodes small ensemble highly specialized membrane associated proteins expect small ensemble representative genes found genomes nutshell mtdna particularly purine rich message strands test hypothesis possible fact possible bacteria aerobic means bacterial species genes cytochrome oxidase nadh dehydrogenase etc dna genes similar mtdna respect strand asymmetric purine content analyze bacterial dna find genes cytochrome oxidase nadh dehydrogenase etc pyrimidine rich message strand mtdna tomorrow post data
