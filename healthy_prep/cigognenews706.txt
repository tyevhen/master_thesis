occurred me ways find fall love whether sustain relationship close others enter physiology answers questions physiology lies history emotional past help predict future slice problem many different perspectives i choose one oxytocin i call hormone love make love oxytocin levels mount rub animal belly levels rise making love tells importance oxytocin since origin life oxytocin neuro hormone key hormone love level oxytocin low less emotional attachment less interest social engagement less caring bonding less touch short less love less love physical base less love early lives found imprint affects many systems effects measurable respects love measurable entity imprint affects sexuality particularly key brain structures amygdala hippocampus translate pain sexual behavior oxytocin found mammals high one experiences sense relaxation rest growth repair healing loving behavior emotional attachment love nurturing early lives necessary optimum health healthy brain development take place without low oxytocin levels indicator early neglect lack touching also indicates dysfunction entire system serves prognosticator later mental physical health presence says i loved could develop normally lack says i unloved system skewed one key indices much love received infancy around birth way may increase sexual drive males testosterone injections may well inject love people least inject hormone encourages give people shot love speak shot may help attach others bond partners allows feel close someone else feel empathize feelings pain bonding strong emotional attachment helps want one another help protect one another touch become sexual one another high levels oxytocin encourage strengthen bonding early trauma lack love affect output hormone ability relate good sex later determined even birth someone swear full love find low essential hormone love oxytocin actually good news less love physical base may something chemically alter state certainly something psychologically change well sometime future may able determine proper love parent child measurements various hormones least oxytocin i state wide use help birth along affecting contractions mother pitocin early parental love permanent painkiller rats able self administer painkillers pressing lever given oxytocin oxytocin ot inhibits development tolerance drugs morphine also decreases painful withdrawal symptoms occur one taken drugs degree addiction measured severity one withdrawal yet oxytocin reduces severity symptoms love thing early love calibrates system life current shot love someone hugging kissing may well

first lowered oxytocin inability love bond lack early love lowered set points oxytocin i would choose latter hormones sensitive early trauma must take care blame high low levels genetic factors must never forget critical nine months life womb bonding positive aspect human relationships learn bond emotionally adulthood early bonding childhood simplistic sounds taught certainly taught later life attachment pretty well set childhood something learn something feel also something biochemical bond early parents may well condemned lifetime broken fragile tenuous relationships may large part due

high levels oxytocin love seems ultimate painkiller permanent one prepares challenges life ultimate survival tool need good sex life loved early parents means inter alia right birth months afterward i

oxytocin levels way create stress pregnant woman inject steroids psychological effect precisely needle mother kind loving raise serotonin levels offspring better handle adversity doctor inject serotonin offspring produce temporary calming effect different created loving look mother mother inject oxytocin baby milk contains high levels hormone love looks like injected injected naturally proper time produce loving human oxytocin means quick birth synthetic oxytocin known pitocin given mothers need stimulation contractions i surmise mothers need oxytocin expedite birth process may history pain lowered levels make giving birth difficult statistics indicate mothers give birth cesarean lower levels oxytocin additionally oxytocin given mothers facilitate birth process also enhances love feel child nurse better relaxed baby conversely chronically anxious mother may leave offspring low oxytocin levels contribute child trouble later life bonding forming attachments well harboring latent tendency addiction thus lack early love translates inadequate chemicals bond creating vicious cycle misery unhappy relationships poor sexual function failed marriages suffering abandoned children bear brunt something root causes infancy mother loving feelings transmitted fetus biochemistry oxytocin levels pregnant woman later physical contact raises oxytocin levels loved early looked touched listened nuzzled adored biological changes subtle though may follow throughout lives yet mother takes good care depressed anxious take drugs eats properly produce loving child traumas birth
