yesterday exercise comparing execution speed rhino standalone versus rhino embedded jre i decided carry couple performance investigations i curious find first much slower rhino pure java implementation javascript would say spidermonkey implementation firefox i repeated numerical efficiency test yesterday euler expansion series pi got following results execution time speed time higher values worse plotted vertically surprising result firefox interpreter much faster standalone rhino axis goes zero milliseconds trials axis run zero values terms argument yesterday pi function words took rhino milliseconds calculate pi million terms whereas took firefox spidermonkey ms thing making firefox interpreter faster rhino comes looking quite good considering java shocking comparison emerged i tested rhino acrobat may know adobe acrobat comes javascript engine presumably written i expected blow doors rhino results astonishingly acrobat interpreter full order magnitude slower rhino requiring milliseconds calculate pi million terms versus ms rhino slow i idea perhaps someone adobe comment bottom line assume something written java automatically slow depends runtime environment exactly trying respect rhino rises high begin
