advising physicians manage time generally good idea i cut chase one answer two fold medical practice nature inefficient secondly many people incentivized waste physicians time reading another blog topic apparent people attempting give advice physicians either think quite slow uptake appreciation medical practice like misunderstood part much time physicians forced waste work unnecessary work patient care i preface remarks saying many visits i physicians specialties i never seen time consider myself lucky seen within minutes time record waiting minutes seen emergency department one day wait another hours discharged physician saw me rather uncomplicated problem expedited line physicians clinics eds hospitals wait like everybody else premise efficiency medical practice favorite administrators salespeople pushing valuable time saving devices physicians primary among electronic health record ehr i think finally consensus fact basically created large pool physician stenographers spend additional hours day typing documents designed billing coding purposes rather enhancing care patients i roll frequently stated comparison two interns myself could complete daily documentation busy bed neurosurgery service hours rounding senior residents associated work day today would probably take additional hours work would mean less time operating room learning neurosurgery attendings wondering happened team i heard surgical services hire retired surgeons come scribes operative notes reduce paperwork burden documentation burden worse primary care advice shift time around allow ample time documentation never considers fact time slots clinic rarely set stone people show minutes late expect seen emergencies happen need dealt people stacked waiting area labs need reviewed outgoing tasks paperwork phone calls prescriptions consults need handled none trivial tasks terms time takes get done friends endocrinology walk typical morning test results stacked computer queue need review top full patient schedule day something cases right away outpatient clinics certain routines every day depending specialties involved amount staff available example primary

situations leads even less time see patients physicians hit hard ehr like many jobs implied electronic access physicians completing documentation hours home answering mails texts patient problems uncommon start clinic notice addition full schedule appointments labs review also mails messages ehr many marked urgent first appointment clinic day physician said respond urgent problem believe i understand post might elicit widely varying emotions overworked burned physicians see obvious truths wearily think done readers like one suggested i drive porsche rather soccer mom van outraged rich doctor dares complain working conditions readers think physicians complain basic principles i guess want physicians acting like workers supposed privileged noble calling recognize physicians managed like production workers professionals trying silence complaining physicians suggesting unprofessional characterizing legitimate complaints whining generally political agenda includes managing physicians like production workers apparent extra time manage many people say working hard doctors therefore doctors legitimate point i would say i doubt many americans working long hard hours
