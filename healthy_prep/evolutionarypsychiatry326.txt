today i went back school every fall i help teach introduction psychiatry class second year medical students institution i work small group teaching basic interviewing write skills today large lecture though i got audience thumbing month stack journals students introduced psychiatry interesting papers archives general psychiatry month always case archives tends really tedious genetic polymorphism functional mri studies wazoo get paper headings like reduced brain white matter integrity trichotillomania believe me even interesting sounds still archives excellent journal accept horrible studies boring ones first interesting one modification cognitive performance schizophrenia complexin gene polymorphisms i know sounds really boring give chance turns group germany put together database genetic data schizophrenia research different research centers compiled genetic data patients schizophrenia controls threw dna big machines pops loads data phenotypic data points patient specific gene complexin codes type protein regulates synaptic signaling happens brain specifically complexin control release soluble ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor snare differences complexin proteins mrna noted previous autopsy studies schizophrenics genes obvious place look autopsy studies significant decrease complexin found regions brain specifically damaged schizophrenia like dorsolateral prefrontal cortex hippocampus protein gene expression found decreased studies bipolar disorder alzheimer huntington disease different parts brain affected disorders disorders though symptoms cognitive impairment meaning advanced stages disease ca think clearly sure enough traced schizophrenia patients certain types poorly expressed complexin gene tended cognitive impairment schizophrenia patients okay particularly interesting least evolutionary medicine standpoint except i could help notice disorders except bipolar disorder ones i discussed blog evidence link wheat metabolic syndrome mice knocked complexin genes issues apparently cognitive ones take mice deprive mothers complexin knockout mice get mouse dementia sorts genetic difference plus stress seems cause disease good old two hit hypothesis next one warm cockles sun worshiping hearts neonatal vitamin status risk schizophrenia population based case control study thank netherlands apparently keeps dried blood samples babies born researchers took individuals schizophrenia sex age matched controls pulled blood samples big bank 'o blood figured neonate vitamin levels vitamin big suspect schizophrenia following reasons vitamin undoubtedly plays role development brain people born winter spring higher risk developing schizophrenia farther born equator likely birth month factor immigrants dark skin move northern countries also children higher rates schizophrenia addition city kids likely develop schizophrenia compared country kids study first time someone able go back directly check vitamin levels neonatal blood people later get schizophrenia average level vitamin measured oh vitamin varied widely winter summer babies born march cases controls lowest levels around deficient babies born august average level nearly good one caveat actual level may misleading level might degrade time samples years old tested however since matched controls age patient presumed degradation would sets data key results babies born vitamin level lowest risk schizophrenia might actual level measured many years later babies within lowest two quintiles lowest vitamin levels significantly increased risk surprisingly babies highest quintile highest vitamin levels higher risk researchers able go back check sorts variables might confound things uv light therapy birth high bilirubin might affect vitamin levels example admission nicu age sex etc etc nothing seemed change overall shaped data curve sweet spot rd th quintiles vitamin levels researchers wisely emphasized caution considering results observational study plenty confounders nobody thought however cause effect relationship holds true researchers suggest mere vitamin supplementation dark skinned immigrants northern countries could reduce incidence schizophrenia populations staggering third study issue called birth weight schizophrenia adult mental disorder researchers pretty much might think large scale followed million single babies born sweden denmark countries comprehensive national registers psychiatric treatment sweden denmark countries registered cases schizophrenia cases adult psychiatric disorder first thought cases schizophrenia seems low million around cases worldwide prevalence right around something keep mind results birth weight less grams pounds ounces babies translated higher risk schizophrenia risk actually decreases schizophrenia birth weights go heavier kiddos lower risk way pounds ounces low birth weight also translated higher risk mental disorders including aggregate diagnoses group subgroup substance abuse mood disorders like major depression bipolar disorder anxiety disorders indeed subgroups higher birth weight way megababy pounder group lower risk interesting obviously low birth weight associated sorts issues premature delivery infection brain hemorrhages could stress baby forming brain interesting heavy babies lower risk called normal weight babies i actually would expected another shaped curve still could huge confounders high birth weights associated gestational diabetes i sure common sweden denmark back maybe would much factor i would thought one confounding factors could actually vitamin study showed maternal vitamin intake associated birth weight low vitamin lower average birth weight postulated adequate vitamin intake protects moms infections study little interesting white women vitamin level lowest risk small gestational age babies relationship vitamin levels birth weight black women course matesz blogged today study showing pregnant women took iu vitamin daily lower risk preterm birth told several interesting findings month get vitamin deficient try go nuts supplementation either levels best ask doctor go grassroots health order home test i tend aim level perhaps pregnant women would want go bit higher caucasian women may want aim range sure getting k also i always use pastured butter i also vitamin supplement comes k believe another blog worthy study month archives i save later week see
