patient rights condition occurred patient given forced medications prohibited court order quality assessment performance improvement qapi programs extended across number clinical nonclinical disciplines cases involved administration stated would descriptions quality improvement best example i think reference six sigma i always found questionable practice apply engineering management processes medical field i sat presentation paradigm previous job seemed like standard management buzzwords hear different iterations people think inventing management every years job suffered couple presentations printed powerpoints faded soon came moved different paradigm since widely promoted six sigma approach shown uniformly effective business manufacturing models proponents six sigma medical fields seem understand measurement limiting factor nowhere near precision accuracy measuring products electronics automobiles philosophical level administration probably made common error espousing philosophy could live i aware major healthcare corporation uses six sigma management model probably many resources state hospital one case examples cited agitated patient physically aggressive received olanzapine intramuscular haloperidol despite court order excluding haloperidol risperidone psychiatrist nurse involved questioned said unaware order time medication administered patient got medication period days discontinued cms investigators comment physician case could held contempt court ignoring district court judge order question whether two different orders one barring medications showed later physician worked different court orders cases years i attest fact necessarily clear many cases temporary order final document typed would seem quality process would appoint person make sure latest order chart read attending physician medication orders written also question paper documents court placed electronic record easily read record end document problems care different patients different diagnoses problems reviewed clinical examples given illustrate patient varied problems given treatment plans comprehensive even case patients aggressive self injurious behavior reports describes interventions patient treatment plan generic normal functions professional disciplines involved patient care individualized patient mean recent article startribune quotes several mental health experts advocates state affairs amrtc commentary seemed vary level outrage expressed egregious appalling excuse expert i read report seems scratch surface would correcting deficiencies report right ship amrtc possibly previous news report suggests much bigger problem report incidents aggression increasing opinion aggressive inmates transferred based new legislation main reason union representative quoted saying inmates transferred correctional facilities taken aggressive non correctional patients none problems specifically addressed report report comments problems care specific individuals one seem aggressive two patients mentioned original article errors report may largely documentation reading errors administrators always emphasize documented happen problems amrtc decades making long time message given professionals state state hospital system including amrtc like practically hospitals state system going shut practical fact always backlog committed patients waiting get amrtc prevents shut key question remains really attitude managers level state minnesota second problematic attitude i heard constantly written recent article nearly half patients currently longer meet hospital level criteria care kept hospital nowhere go community alone patients spent total unnecessary days anoka metro treated enough care another patients according state legislative report good example circular reasoning reason patients spend called unnecessary days amrtc facilities manage behavior i aware programs aggressive individuals managed small settings resident group homes staff taught physically restrain become aggressive really unacceptable long term solution problem many reasons time stop pretending long term hospitals acute care hospitals managed like acute care community hospitals transient reduction symptoms mean patient amrtc spending unnecessary days hospital successfully transition community placement probably need real unaddressed issues beyond cms report effect message state hospitals closed psychiatrist state i hearing long time really possible develop quality care focus necessary stable staffing patterns experienced staff staff hearing state trying close facility many people facility need instead facility managed one provide state art care patients complex problems including violence aggression another aspect eliminating positions experienced staff save money never high quality program using approach yet state used approach effect management higher levels seemed stand i read issue generic treatment plans cms report level treatment plans become generic treatment plan evidence purchase treatment planning texts nursing psychotherapy lesser degree psychiatry show generic treatment plans entire list problems problem really generic treatment plan covers interaction lack treatment plan addresses high degree aggression i would contend latter complicating issue previous stories plans implemented state administrators psychiatric experience address patient aggression i sat one sessions suggested focus aggressive person psychologically traumatized individual best way proceed much specifics least part problem state hospital staff inadequate guidance aggression reluctant intervene early clearly document happened response response administrators inconsistent advised use interventions ineffective lack teamwork possibly split staff one dangerous problems inpatient psychiatric environment staff splitting staff praised well liked criticized disliked emotional environment inpatient care leads problems patient care splitting needs minimized eliminated largely recognizing professionalism objective analysis treatment problems real priority i treatment environments staff disliked falsely accused lead major problems patient care episodes aggression also leads staff turnover attitude administrators particularly insidious create immediate rift among staff influx inmates amrtc caused current public policy rationing community psychiatric care resulting shift cost care correctional system instead addressing widespread problem rationing psychiatric care severely mentally ill solution currently dump least law enforcement facilities rationed long term care facility solution anything real problems amrtc within state system far i tell based i read papers cms report extensive inpatient patient experience well experience
