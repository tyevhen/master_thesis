information discussed average age psychiatrists increased also seen thousands patients different kinds emotional problems successfully treated information content i find surprising information content diagnostic interviews never estimated importance never really taught may correlation length interview necessarily i interview person gives brief high information content responses reasonably good assessment minutes i talk person digresses gives lot irrelevant details still i need end minutes hour person assist me brief interview common experience i would say represent people i seen also augenblick diagnoses ones made blink eye i see person catatonia delirium stroke i may say anything me rapid diagnoses precipitate thought process else needs ruled tests need done immediately confirm
