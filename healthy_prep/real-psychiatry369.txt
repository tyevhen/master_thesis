recent article new england journal medicine adds epidemiological data issue treatment geriatric depression centerpiece article ramin mojabai md graphic combination data national survey drug use health nsduh national health nutrition examination survey nhanes central point majority people diagnosed depression primary care clinics meet diagnostic criteria major depression actual numbers elderly diagnosed depression diagnosed major depression actually diagnosis major depression assessed rating scales structured interviews bar graphs panel illustrate people age taking antidepressants meet criteria major depression opposite true year olds antidepressant prescriptions less prevalence depression panel illustrates prevalence people told clinician depression meet criteria major depression cases clinicians involved estimated non major depression prevalent major depression learn anything graphs striking feature panel dissociation total number people taking antidepressants people diagnosis major depression i see happening couple reasons i would expect number people stable antidepressant therapy accumulate time would major depression stable remission would longer meet criteria related issue atypical presentations depression increasing age i seen many cases depression presenting pseudodementia parkinson syndrome polyarthritis similar chronic pain syndrome cases symptoms responded antidepressant medication would meet criteria major depression often evaluation would resemble evaluation medical problem also problem depression aging population form dementia upper end age distribution may involve many year old population likely overrepresented primary care settings lastly problem suicide elderly i reviewed recent paper american journal geriatric psychiatry documented decreased risk suicide elderly men women taking antidepressants increased suicide risk group likely many primary care physicians concerned higher level risk may influence prescribing group interesting comparison using different methodologies ballpark antidepressant use elderly denmark approximates antidepressant use probably percentage points lower study denmark used robust marker antidepressant use refilling actual prescription rather survey questions author addresses issue antidepressants used applications like headaches chronic pain chronic pain states epidemiological perspective two thirds prescriptions clinician diagnosed mood disorder standard used study dsm major depression criteria strict use marker antidepressant use since valid psychiatric indications primary care physicians aware treat panic disorder generalized anxiety disorder social anxiety disorder dysthymia also fluid states like adjustment disorders seem merit treatment based severity duration many cases fact available treatment modalities possible explanation author observation majority people diagnosed depression primary care clinics meet criteria major depression diagnostic complexity another issue primary care settings patients often less severely depressed significant anxiety may undisclosed problem drugs alcohol associated medical comorbidity ideal situation diagnosis depression necessarily easy diagnosis make takes full cooperation patient fairly accurate historian regard symptom onset dates harder find literature suggests epidemiological literature often depends lay interviewers using structured interviews like dis sads make longitudinal diagnoses approach work large number patients significant number able recall events dates medications prior treatments degree accuracy level uncertainty antidepressant prescription often comes therapeutic trial patient physician directly observe happens available reliable data author notes primary intervention depression primary care prescription antidepressants talks ethical concerns exposing patients especially elderly antidepressant drugs warranted using major depression diagnosis standard treatment makes observation i made mass screening depression warranted based concern false positives stance supported canadian task force preventive health care preventive services task force recommends screening staff assisted depression care supports position screening especially medical populations problematic false positive perspective also screening checklist often used diagnosis indication starting antidepressant medications screening checklists also political tools used manipulate physicians best example i think using serial phq scores marker depression treatment primary care clinics even though validated application extension application phq used quality marker clinics treating depression time even though valid way analyze resulting longitudinal data author makes recommendations limit overuse antidepressants uses stepped care approach example uk national institute clinical excellence nice guidelines suggest support psychoeducation patient subsyndromal types depression fuller assessment triggered basic inquiries mood loss interest amazingly phq brought assessment tool point monitoring encouragement suggested next step two week follow see symptoms remit spontaneously medications third step longstanding depressions remit low level psychosocial interventions expert level intervention suggested patient psychosis high risk suicide treatment resistance seems like departure nice relative guideline treatment chronic neuropathic pain case referral specialty care contingent specific prescribing consideration opioids pain specialist considered gatekeeper opioid prescriptions situation antidepressants seen overprescribed drugs gatekeeper necessary i suppose argument could made enough psychiatrists job really fewer pain specialists prescribe opioids chronic neuropathic pain uk model slight variation minnesota hmo model screening everyone primary care clinic phq treating soon possible antidepressants driving factor cost month citalopram costing little conceivable low level psychosocial intervention cost effective i also proponent computerized psychotherapy useful intervention likely information technology piece needed deliver psychotherapy would inexpensive another well known correlate depression elderly isolation loneliness i surprised find interventions target problems since would probably involve highest cost article standard research proven psychotherapies recommended par medical treatment depression question anyone actually get level therapy anymore experience assessing patients gone crisis oriented patients discharged first signs improvement may happen sessions i doubt stepped care approach much curb antidepressant prescribing study suggests overprescribing problem using strict indication major depression always problems sorted i seen studies team psychiatrists goes primary care clinic typical exhaustive diagnostic assessment might see psychiatric clinic would probably much relevant question hand standardized lay interviews checklists also precedent interventions curb prescribing medications unsuccessful cdc program reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions clear markers lack bacterial infection ignored chances abstract diagnostic process traction finally stepped care interventions seem weak good place number professional public service organizations intervene directly address psychosocial aspects depression elderly public education large scale may useful psychoeducation pieces included relevant periodicals ahead time rather way avoid use medications environmental interventions decrease isolation loneliness another potential solution medical perspective concern medication risk every clinic antidepressants prescribed clear idea risks assess prevent patients high risk antidepressants identified every possible non medication intervention even moderately expensive ones exhausted prescription antidepressant medication primary care prescribing patterns potentially impact patient antidepressants also analyzed discussed focus risks side effects impact prescription antidepressants psychosocial interventions waiting depression go away george dawson md dfapa supplementary permission credit graphic new england
