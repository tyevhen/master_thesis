going rely excellent review paper dr david benton swansea uk carbohydrate ingestion blood glucose mood continue exploration question ingestion carbohydrates affects mental state first short term studies guess results dozen studies shown comparisons meal say turkey breast versus starch based meals placebo versus sucrose glucose containing drink surprisingly mood energy measurements minutes sugar drinks shows increase energy levels followed slump two hours protein meals versus starchy meals subjects report decrease subjective sense energy two hours eating starchy meal compared protein studies done subjects resting quietly studies done subjects asked demanding cognitive tasks presumably slurping available glucose noggin burning nitro falling levels reported energy directly correlated falling blood sugar levels subjects low blood glucose minutes hours demanding cognitive tests higher tension ratings high blood glucose diabetics blood glucose levels measured continuously associated immediate mood changes low corresponding negative mood state high levels interesting perturbations phenomena measurements days weeks however i address detail next post theory i actually already discussed length previous posts via insulin albumin effects ingestion carbohydrate leads preferential shuttling rare amino acid tryptophan brain since tryptophan precursor serotonin eating carbohydrates presumably make one serene sleepier sated someone whose brain starving serotonin low cerebrospinal fluid csf serotonin levels associated violence insomnia hunger suicide partly serotonin metabolite melatonin play major role mood appetite sleep centers richard judith wurtman mit ones originally proposed theory suggested humans particularly premenstrual women afflicted seasonal affective disorder crave carbs serotonin boosting pharmacologic effect i seen theory textbooks research papers many many times i rather took fact judith wurtman big carb proponent likely give rather strongly worded quotes media damning low carb diets causing depression comments zooko pointed me er interesting article dr wurtman huffington post also twitter feed advises dubious practice snacking pure carbs meals serotonin surge specific recommendations pretzels rice cakes marshmallows long term i would say anyone wanting lose fat also mental health problems really pretty much avoid adding processed micronutrient poor calories mix interesting good dr benton review paper leaves wurtmans tenuous theory crumbled dust look context carbohydrate ingestion real world absolutely true carbohydrate meal fast increase entry tryptophan brain rodents humans primates problem moment eat bit food protein effect longer takes place dr garner able increase serotonin mice brains via mixed diet fed little critters extra tryptophan supplements trick resulted increased mouse brain serotonin deadly increase scratching subsequent skin infections without extra tryptophan boost little protein meal eliminate carbohydrate tryptophan boosting effect put amount protein perspective potatoes rice chocolate flour much protein increase tryptophan entry brain bascially one eat pure starch sugary drink achieve pharmacologic carb serotonin effect long enough previous meal protein remains gut also means pretzels rice cakes would work serotonin surge one must stick marshmallows jelly beans much evolutionary precedent teensy amount protein killing serotonin surge true studies rats primates humans monkeys grimes et al contrasted protein carbohydrate breakfasts found impact levels cerebrospinal fluid csf tryptophan serotonin turnover individual carbohydrate heavy meals went protein calories protein declined plasma csf levels tryptophan due lower amounts raw material protein consumed immediate change serotonin turnover csf tryptophan levels individual meals case monkeys higher protein chronically associated higher serotonin higher carbohydrate blood changes ratio tryptophan amino acids predict csf tryptophan levels rats wurtmans studied i must say wurtmans studies cited good deal often benton teff grimes carbohydrate serotonin increasing theory likely bogus humans especially real world yes even thanksgiving unless happen glass lemonade breakfast every morning excluding food mean carbs affect mood studies without ridiculous attention actual mechanisms show one study drink grams carbohydrate protein decreased depression anger confusion women suffering pms judith wurtman also found women increased intake carbohydrate fat premenstrual stage experimental meals energy protein improve mood women pms find women higher ratios tryptophan blood women given control meals women improved mood also increase blood levels tryptophan suggesting mechanism improved mood researchers find several reviews found women generally report increased craving sweets increased appetite pre menstrual period humans animals also changes basal metabolic rate different parts cycle corresponding appetite changes makes sense however review studies women actually eat showed difference total amount carbohydrate consumed part menstrual cycle studies shown increase sweets chocolate cake consumption menses compared ovulation occurs mid cycle definite evidence appetite increases bit menstruation corresponds higher metabolic rate foods generally containing combination carbohydrate fat craved strictly carbohydrates studies carbohydrate ingestion associated better mood de castro subjects keep food diaries mood journals days found days carbohydrates consumed mood better people felt energetic also found cumulative effect carbohydrate consumed week happier person tended study folks reported mood mid day ate morning absolute carbohydrate male subjects consumed morning happier morning mood absolute relative amounts protein fat impact mood unpublished study benton finally studies experimental low carb vs high carb diets one week three weeks six weeks one year show better comparative mood increased serenity high carb dieters one year study complicated fact twice many people low carb group antidepressants studies may short duration bypass low carb flu low carb diets may high omega i energy chase full texts studies right i seen year long one however one week one done cyclists might cranky first week low carb diet training learned well wurtmans carbohydrate tryptophan serotonin boost theory scuttled carbohydrates seem cause craziness people seem help story different folks insulin resistance find next time though might quick intervening review related topic post one please see later post carbs serotonin connection
