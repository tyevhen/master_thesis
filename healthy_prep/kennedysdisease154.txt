october last year paper published findings patients kennedy disease united states somewhat different scope natural history sbma report i discussed may information provided report obtained last nih clinical trial title report clinical features spinal bulbar muscular atrophy today article i highlight certain findings i found interesting i would recommend interested please follow link read entire paper report also concluded longer cag repeat length number earlier onset also commented longer cag repeat length greater abnormalities motor sensory nerve conduction patients sensory problems reported significant difference mune motor unit number estimation sbma subjects control healthy group sensory nerve issue nerve conduction one bothered many kennedy disease time tingling numbness feet hands parts body frustrating reported symptom recently table reviewed results study also explained androgen receptor nuclear receptor normally regulates gene expression ligand binding normally testosterone dihydrotestosterone recent studies indicate bindings important development kennedy disease concluded kennedy disease manifestations primarily due ligand dependent toxic gain function mutant androgen receptor whew mouthful gave several examples observations promote hypothesis affected adl activities daily living walking falling swallowing speech handwriting nine patients reported difficulty falling oh lucky report several charts graphs amplifying clinical findings i encourage review i emphasize interesting information average age first muscle weakness range mean average time noticing muscle weakness clinical diagnosis years average age diagnosis years patients reported misdiagnosed initially average cag repeat length range common initial symptom muscle cramps followed tremors leg weakness half patients reported initial weakness legs another third reported bulbar symptoms patients knew family members kennedy disease patients elevated creatine kinase strength muscle groups ranged healthy control group table interesting me weakness asymmetric patients weakness dominant side patients used assistive devices canes walkers ankle foot orthoses one interesting conclusions development treatment sbma early intervention may also important affect disease progression old codgers lose another finding interesting finding higher lower testosterone levels associated better muscle strength function indicates may necessary balance anabolic strengthening effects androgen receptors potential deleterious effects harmful often unexpected way androgen activated mutant androgen receptor toxicity another whew i need determine actually means know testosterone like poison defective mutant androgen receptor also know ohio state trial testosterone injections late work yet study reflects patients higher testosterone levels better muscle strength makes sense except higher testosterone greater damage muscles motor neurons androgen receptor day job nothing every easy well i hope find report interesting i let me know thoughts conclusions chance
