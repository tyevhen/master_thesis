retirement moving less activity one critical questions make transition professional besides feeling fairly healthy fit i also feel like i top game psychiatrist time psychiatrists age i try gradual transition patient care teaching i walk away lot people seem think answer observed work habits included many hours compromises concluded never retire psychiatric colleague i known longest concluded thinks end carted away day job worked decades i know i could i walked away setting years ago burned fully intending call quits work job years easy lose sight fact many reasonable jobs hunker longevity mode see crisis hits i put preliminary communications i concluded couple years ago rewarding efficient use time would teaching preferably psychiatric residents residency programs much different today i resident business management basically corrupted today virtually impossible teaching clinical faculty anywhere productivity expectations psychiatrists private practice words expectation see large numbers patients continue innovative creative teacher salary justified amount billing generated never really worked me i attached one old storage devices current network afternoon sitting drive series powerpoints psychopharmacology hour lectures i came scratch meeting residency director program i affiliated residents year requested i teach psychopharmacology lectures i peripheral involvement program point largely due administrative restrictions thought really important me i agreed i would significant time penalty me productivity credit preparing delivering lectures additional

room i need current stage life senior staff days people house staff attendings consulted absolute best teaching team i ever worked nephrology team froedtert hospital milwaukee last rotation medical school i recall finishing rounds pm night graduation walking across county hospital grounds apartment like yesterday team staffed two senior nephrologists late remaining team members included nephrology fellow two internal medicine residents intern me myth senior staff somehow knew less less relevant quite opposite rounded twice day consults hospitalized patients covered senior staff primary discussants myth alive well today largely means disenfranchise tested clinical methods medicine make future generations physicians dependent organizations run business managers rather colleagues organizations promoted idea tests arbitrary unvalidated performance metrics important spending enough time patients enough time discussing clinical scenarios broad range physicians including experienced colleagues coincidence myth thrives non academic hospital environments staffed generalists working impossible shifts knowledge academics seems leanest point past years point i resigned i i offered services significant number reasons none may come pass hardest thing retirement me comes three issues first nearly enough people take place psychiatry possibly best example field decimated political business influences even midst obvious shortage services throughout entire career shortage psychiatrists nobody done thing second inefficient transfer knowledge i personally taken teaching loop long time business practices made impossible me teach i know written texts i pass along dies me counter evolution knowledge passed one generation next american politics business practices stop evolution tracks finally active part person treatment recovery mental illness important me every case involves internal process part psychiatrist retrospect i attributed great teachers colleagues great memory particular personality characteristic scholarship compulsive despite measurement based people say validation process totally subjective end day years decades later person saying made difference life knowing happened gave best medical advice could time me personally also meant seeing people severe problems i wo miss productivity based work i walked assembly line george dawson md dfapa addendum i realized last couple years blog factors transition well people always asked me i know something i quote research suggest particular treatment method analysis i think part i
