profiles young researchers earlier post called nine stages i mentioned hope ninth stage i ended post saying acceptance armed additional knowledge researchers working diligently towards finding treatment potentially cure i discovered something missing recently life hope another post another ray hope research front i commented fortunate another generation picked baton continues move towards finish line finding treatment cure long someone carrying baton hope post i wish recognize another researcher carrying baton isabella palazzolo ph researcher massachusetts general institute neurodegenerative diseases mind massachusetts general hospital harvard medical school charlestown bruce decide focus research kennedy disease isabella first interest i still undergraduate school always neurons i met first mentor angelo poletti i discovered motor neurons i found extremely interesting tiny cells spinal cord modulate movements body entire life i think equilibrium inside cells amazing i really curious understand better find goes wrong disease fix bruce personally know anyone kennedy disease isabella i feel lucky three years ago i occasion join kda meeting event gave me bunch new reasons study work kennedy disease everyone i met patients patients families real example dedicated lovely brave people i believe meeting guys kda conference atlanta really changing point scientific life bruce briefly summarize currently working feel important kd research isabella i working past three years dr fischbeck lab supervision maria pennuto people acknowledged i done far i said starting point equilibrium motor neuron i believe extremely important imagine motor neurons solution contact proteins around charged positively negatively charge surface regulates way communicates interacts proteins polyq expanded interactions proteins change becomes toxic i decided study i change order reverse counteract toxicity polyq i think attaching phosphate group phosphorylation molecule ubiquitin ubiquitination good tool change protein protein interactions thus i studied consequences phosphorylation akt kinase protective huntington disease also found phosphorylation indeed protective cells flies mouse model sbma kennedy disease interest understand happens phosphorylated motor neurons i think study important highlighted potential therapy sbma kennedy disease akt activity stimulated insulin like growth factor i igf demonstrated igf protective cells mice i also think important identify happen phosphorylated might identify new targets therapies hopefully help understand mechanisms disease bruce aspirations career goals isabella i really like translational research i started phd i bring sbma new lab i would love keep working neurodegenerative diseases sbma particular long term question i use post translational modifications phosphorylation ubiquitination ecc target mutant proteins reduce toxicity mechanisms behind bruce anything else interesting would like mention isabella i would like thank previous current mentors angelo poletti teaching me i know maria pennuto kurt fischbeck great examples successful determined scientists dimitri krainc open minded approach science giving me possibility keep working sbma lab last least thanks kda association meeting really motivating
