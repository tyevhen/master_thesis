recent ish posts i stumbling piecemeal towards existential phenomenological theory hallucination i looking i take holy grail psychopathology alongside know cracking das wahnproblem oh properly theorising thought disorder dissociality theory reveals piece ness form content schizophrenic hallucination course supposition mine 'hope like indeed piece psychologists psychiatrists think otherwise
