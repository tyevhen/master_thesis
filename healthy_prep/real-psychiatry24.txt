event happening tomorrow philosophical biological engineering implications respective definitions conscious state humans even opening blade runner film highly anticipated sequel blade runner science fiction film starring harrison ford deckard former cop blade runner recruited back active service latter blade runners assigned hunt terminate replicants bioengineered androids androids product tyrell corporation plot first film involves deckard needing track terminate replicants including escaped form mining colony replicants engineered similar humans basic appearance behavior social interaction many superior strength intelligence speed part plot would seem enough except blade runners need specific skill detect replicants humans need able administer test voight kampff machine determine test subject human replicant series test questions visual stimuli administered pupillary response typical polygraphic measures like respiratory heart rate particles emitted skin measured test questions designed detect empathic responses subject suggesting human replicants question programmed die years prevent acquiring empathy becoming undetectable early original film two interviews first appears routine interview employee goes bad asked response would saw tortoise desert laying back struggling sun able right second interview critical deckard travels tyrell corporation meets dr eldon tyrell rachael appears assistant dr tyrell interested v k machine blade runner protocol detecting replicants rachael asks false positives procedure ever retired human mistake eventually tyrell asks deckard administer protocol rachael done deckard discuss results exchange tyrell interrupts questioning deckard one question watching stage play banquet progress guests enjoying appetizer raw oysters entree consists boiled dog tyrell would step moments rachael thank deckard replicant tyrell i impressed many questions usually take spot deckard i get tyrell tyrell many questions deckard twenty thirty cross referenced tyrell took hundred rachael deckard know tyrell beginning suspect i think deckard suspect know imagery film outstanding acting good opening scenes set stage sci fi fans recognize blade runners used future originally november terminate replicants also detect specific augmented interview protocol action starts unfold additional philosophical questions arise opening scenes basic post concept kind procedure detect deception time recognizable form polygraph basis v k machine interview protocol based upon polygraphic research illustrates extremely serious limitations use security screening rationale device weak despite findings inadmissibility court polygraph continues used security screenings informal screening criminal suspects though works would emotional correctly psychophysiological response questions empathy yield better predictive response patterns probably need keep mind author idea screening machine consciousness humans although viewer aware questions asked typical protocol compliant replicant ones asked impressive terms empathy empathy conscious quality varying definitions empathy technical skill probably rigorous definition applied screenplay common definition empathy ability understand another person subjective state word empathy used dr tyrell asks interview v k machine empathy test initial questions deckard asks seem focused ethical behavior societal standards later deckard breaks protocol rachael suggests memories implanted others really apart action sequences important aspect original blade runner whole idea may unique human conscious state differentiated machine consciousness even sophisticated machines test consciousness subjective interview protocol combined physiological measures supposed enhancement main metric empathy measures purely qualitative ability distinguish differences empathy different humans discussed suspect v k protocol valid test conceivable humans least empathy could confused replicant problem consciousness subject debate decades including specific test distinguish humans machines trying emulate humans i take look specific test always good idea look problem defining consciousness practically paper focused consciousness discusses problem definition outset medical perspective term probably even less certain application neurology contrast subjects discernible neurological problem classic texts like plum posner diagnosis stupor coma discuss consciousness awareness self awareness environment consciousness also viewed determined level arousal content consciousness defined sum cognitive affective experiential products brain fractional loss consciousness discussed possible specific neuronal functions lost differentiate acute states eg delirium stupor coma subacute chronic states eg dementia discuss determined clinically states studied primarily neurologists along clearly altered states consciousness like sleep general anesthesia assuming major disruptions neuroanatomy physiology definition baseline conscious state also lacks precision general agreement person needs level awareness experience able experience sensory phenomenon thoughts emotions authors break standard components mental status exam much normal life routinely lose consciousness non rem sleep regain periods rem sleep today know situation even complex appears posterior cortical zone correlates dreaming experience de dreaming experience ne rem non rem sleep unique aspects brain complexity human experience generates unique conscious state individuals makes impossible fully appreciate specific conscious experience another person generally infer conscious typical behaviors one critical factors study consciousness especially stepping away real discontinuities like loss consciousness define clinicians say know see rigorous research definitions lacking level thought experiments things get even confusing consider one original tests invented alan turing published paper subject available free online turing paper interesting number perspectives least predicted years time would digital computers could fool humans least time called imitation game game played asking machine computer series question determine human machine details test protocol original paper suggests communication accomplished teletype machine goal test fool human judge believing machine human rereading original paper clear focus machine thinking rather machine conscious state paper debunks refers argument consciousness saying need emotion self awareness specifically recognizing machine knows done argument appears denial validity test according extreme form view way one could sure machine thinks machine feel oneself thinking one could describe feelings world course one would justified taking notice likewise according view way know man thinks particular man course property conscious states appears take least extreme philosophy professor proposes original argument needed imitation game show machine thinks also sets question difference thinking consciousnesses turing also predicts point time may possible cover computer synthetic human tissue make identification even difficult considers rejects various counterarguments eventual machine intelligence article relationship consciousness intelligence complex practically ai written involves restricted task domains playing games chess poker go verbal chats specific pattern recognition one thought intelligence context sensitive needed complex tasks broken smaller single domain tasks according one expert tononi see reference kind intelligence consciousness i think fairly easy look back turing test see tononi referring face task producing typed transcript appears single domain task behind needs intelligent structure able play game involves making human judge believe transcript produced human rather machine turing refers almost exclusively intelligence thinking case considered consciousness reality testing replicants lot less complicated suggested deckard interviewing technique v k device would polysomnography one clear cut conscious states rem sleep could make argument bioengineered android could set fake sleep eeg guess would costly procedure dr tyrell says original film commerce goal corporation spending lot money faking sleep eeg would hardly cost effective ai philosophers might suggest point machines might learn advantageous competition humans would take lot learning would take lot engineering produce necessary electric potentials standard eeg electrodes inside artificial skull even covered cloned human tissue say least vision film realized anytime soon issue verbal test humanness slightly complicated question even point time first time i heard computer may passed turing test chess player stated playing ibm computer seemed like playing real human restricted task domain paradigm outside i doubt computer could mistaken conscious official milestone computer program passing turing test occurred saturday june annual competition held royal society obviously blinded test robot conversing probably represent much recognizable conscious state ai experts currently working rigorous test machine consciousnesses including interactions sensory modalities order improve level ai i thought related issues post testing ai conscious states may come determining manufacturer theoretical standpoint
