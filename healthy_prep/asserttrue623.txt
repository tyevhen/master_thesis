i note interest apache lucene community recently decided merge development two best known sub projects lucene java lucene solr result code bases sit trunk svn solr runs latest lucene code times release artifacts remain separate lucene remains core search engine java library solr remain search server built top lucene change way things worked past many overlapping committers quite features could benefitted lucene ended placed solr features may belonged lucene due dev issues often best solr keep certain features contributed solr developers solr control code moved lucene could mean solr committer wrote committed code might actually lose ability maintain without assistance lucene committer meanwhile could long waits lucene bug fixes available solr trunk merged dev single set committers across projects everyone communities drive releases solr releases lucene also release hence concerns sometimes release solr development version lucene solr always latest trunk version lucene also lucene benefits greater test coverage developer make single change lucene run tests projects matter look win win situation one probably happened sooner hey better late never
