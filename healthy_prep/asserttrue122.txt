anti depression intervention purported work reliably indeed consider kind gold standard last ditch treatment options electroconvulsive therapy specifically approved refractory depression clinicians tell uncertain terms tends efficacious entirely accurate however fact pretty far mark relief depression guaranteed get relief short lived typically days recent statistics show good faith called safe associated death far higher rate american psychiatric association telling people something i talk separate post also causes cognitive damage surprising number cases permanent cognitive effects tend fall two categories anterograde amnesia retrograde amnesia latter well known means trouble recalling past events former type learning disability ca recall newly learned material advocates tend downplay effects effects quite bit serious people realize however i lay evidence later post hurry learn results see chapter begins page hack depression patient anesthetized minutes short acting barbiturate commonly brevital methohexital patient unconscious muscle relaxant succinylcholine injected reduce risk fractures joint dislocations damage skeletal muscle tendons ligaments common patients modification became routine muscle relaxant causes partial paralysis body including respiratory system patient must supplied oxygen mask assisted breathing muscle relaxant wears patient able resume breathing electrodes placed either bilaterally right side head shock administered machine push button sudden administration current causes patient experience grand mal seizure tonic clonic effects attenuated due muscle relaxant make mistake brain undergoing full blown seizure six twelve shock sessions usually spaced days apart either feel better generally people report positive results feel better days month effects gone one day explain exactly works work always never long completely without scientific basis terms credible scientific theory mode action parsimonious high level explanation inducing amnesia causes forget troubles idea came mistaken belief years ago epilepsy never found coexist schizophrenia hence one could induce epilepsy schizophrenic patient might cure schizophrenia makes much sense saying laughter depression seldom co occur administer tickling therapy people depressed bizarre myth became basis long line human animal experiments shock therapy culminating today fda approved note one time cats dogs monkeys widely used shock experiments large animal experiments long since discontinued however humane reasons today fda approved following indications refractory depression unipolar bipolar schizophrenia bipolar mania mixed states schizoaffective disorder schizophreniform disorder f catatonia therapy involves receiving two three shocks week least two weeks sometimes shock administered bilaterally sometimes localized one side brain cost pay pocket rarely less per treatment around americans per year submit average cost per shock shocks per patient total cost insurance companies medicare close billion per year big business old days electric shock provided using volt sine wave ac current coming less straight wall socket people indiscriminately subjected needlessly high amounts total charge modern protocols properly conducted involve titrating calibrating patient response electricity recognition fact seizure threshold varies individual individual gender well women lower seizure threshold men low dosage involves using amount electricity times seizure threshold patient question high dosage might go high times seizure threshold talking roughly volts amps six seconds applied square wave pulses hardly called innocuous amount electricity severe insult brain enough electricity kill applied wrong parts body fda systematic review studies concluded regard cognitive effects evidence impairment orientation anterograde retrograde memory global cognitive function immediately may last six months autobiographical memory commonly reported memory impairment reviews limited evidence suggest effects memory cognitive function may last six months note peculiar wording last statement fda also say immediately post deficits across nearly cognitive domains noted fda systematic review found appalling shortage controlled trials many studies placebo sham treatment arm patients sham treatment group counseled anesthetized treated exactly regular patients wake procedure told shocked fact sham controlled trials published show surprisingly high effectiveness placebo sham shock therapy relative fact one researcher colin ross institute psychological trauma richardson texas said author reviewed placebo controlled literature electroconvulsive therapy depression study demonstrated significant difference real placebo sham month post treatment many studies failed find difference real sham even period treatment claims textbooks review articles effective consistent published data large properly designed study real versus sham undertaken absence study consent forms include statements controlled evidence demonstrating benefit month post treatment consent forms also state real marginally effective placebo note ross paper found online additional references literature see page fda found extensive review one month following patients showed evidence benefit also amazingly people received sham phony shock treatment exhibited evidence benefit sham effectiveness high true difference may reflect blind breakage maybe sham patients fooled rest wake dazed confused weird muscle aches since believe shocked get better fact sham works almost well ordinary raises interesting possibility anesthesia shock providing therapeutic benefit possibility seems incredibly gone completely unnoticed people vigorously promoting ketamine therapy depression ketamine primary medical use anesthetic reading subject may conclude i benefits modest best perhaps better placebo case low dosage risks unacceptable also therapeutic effect extent one exists decidedly short lived fda extensive literature search found literature supports effectiveness claims time period immediately post approximately one month little evidence supporting effectiveness beyond one month time point controversial treatment well accepted scientific explanation potential cause long lasting harm patients including death i going devote several posts subject please join me next days take closer look literature sham controlled studies people control arm fooled thinking shocked statistics around suicide statistics death evidence
