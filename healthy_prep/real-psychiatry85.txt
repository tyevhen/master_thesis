cannabis use highly politicized time largely due legalization rhetoric spilled scientific research topic despite broad movement legalize cannabis across minority population regular cannabis users widespread use undoubtedly lead increased problems associated wider exposure especially wider exposure populations vulnerabilities toxic effects cannabis toxic effects interest include addiction psychosis common clinical practice encounter daily cannabis smokers stopped using substance several years started get panic attacks paranoia people i see moved something else also substantial number chronic smokers addicted number users comparable amount people problems drinking alcohol inpatient psychiatrists commonly see people florid psychotic episodes smoking significant quantities cannabis also see repeat admissions people either detoxified treated psychotic episodes discharged smoke cannabis point repeat psychotic episode longstanding controversy among people work speculating whether
