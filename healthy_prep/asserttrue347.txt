ever possible seldom sublime acting elevate otherwise unremarkable film status minor classic surely would happened case last station well intentioned tolstoy biopic brought oscar golden globe nominations wins christopher plummer helen mirren commanding portrayals leo sofya tolstoy performances genuinely excellent alas movie fair ask surface think movie life greatest international celebrity th century tolstoy surely could fail compelling tale sadly like tolstoy final journey rail last station falls far short ultimate destination leaving passenger moviegoer stranded wanting place hang shapka speak ingredients strong characters conflict intrigue deception drama leo tolstoy age trying desperately simplify increasingly complex professional family life long since signed worldly

problem last station movie writer director michael hoffman working jay parini novel chose give extremely narrow snapshot enormous subject less like trying capture grand canyon brownie camera movie try give significant slice tolstoy life actually happy focus weeks final weeks great man story worse story told eyes rather insignificant character tolstoy replacement secretary replacing gusev short time imprisoned young valentin bulgakov along way made suffer bulgakov irrelevant romance young woman way related tolstoy real world character movie thus fails several levels fails first giving significant slice tolstoy life merely presents year old master world celebrity ready made expects bring significant knowledge tolstoy backstory movie also distracts main story i said forcing watch utterly forgettable romantic side plot never intersects main plot movie also fails show true main character movie whatever scope great russian writer namely mother russia may unfair compare movie last station modest aspirations equally modest budget million david lean unforgettable cinematic rendition boris pasternak doctor zhivago cost million dollars fact one seen doctor zhivago fail consciously unconsciously make comparison mind lean movie subsequent movie involving iconic russian figure striking thing one many doctor zhivago time movie viewer unaware looming presence main character bigger life russia unfortunately crucially lose essential character last station without story tolstoy final weeks seems like little thin domestic farce easy spew criticism fix could writer director done rescue last station clutches mediocrity aside rewriting stage play particular could improved without expanding story zhivago like epic spanning whole tolstoy life i think first necessary sufficient limited budget film tell story tolstoy last ten years rather final year dispensing trivial bulgakov character meaningless romance save many feet film could better put use telling story eyes tolstoy
