i writing gestational life decades i never discussed baby home placenta detail never seem consider placenta organ secreting hormones chemicals like key organs affected trauma reacts peculiar way home wall uterus merges mother yet remains apart therefore seems foreign mother yet rejected placenta kind monitoring device mediating communications fetus mother constant conversation taking place two mostly chemical means first order business placental defense keeping sorts pathogens harmful chemicals thus communicator barrier preventing allowing cells migrate one another indeed fetal cells found mother long time birth placenta manufactures products help keep pregnancy ongoing normal although would logical expect split contributions parent placenta case rather seems battle whose contribution dominate father genes help provide growth placenta even mother genes help impede growth genes job runaway growth serious disease runaway growth often associated cancer paternal genes growth please see life vital link loke discussion subject carried sixty percent nutrients dedicated growth fetal brain slight changes oxygen fetal development affect evolution fetal brain case mammals first step towards formation placenta taken soon egg fertilized sperm loke placenta living organ go living even embryo dies primitive nervous system sense danger mount defenses including neuro chemicals serotonin fight invasion embryo one harvest stem cells cells capable healing diseases extending life think implications placenta paternal genes promote growth maternal ones impede faulty pregnancy tendencies get disrupted get large placenta small one changes biochemistry alter genes expressed trauma mother possible part methyl group recruited alter gene expression baby methyl attach outside gene either switch gene epigenetics i discussed critical period terms baby must hugged loved also case implantation period receptivity implantation one week fertilization critical period crucial want make sure baby properly attached mother notion critical period must apply placenta well i stated living independent organ embryo must behave abide rules critical period different aspects evolution trying loved age six years bit later matter greatly luckily outside critical window implantation happen meanwhile events womb crucial later development baby placenta lives environment environment must salubrious child health must focus placenta uterus many weeks gestation rather need aware start birth something lives something dies placenta gone baby alive world blood diverted placenta lungs viable life begins baby left home speak strikes alone without help mother live conversation fetus mother ended takes new role words emotions need hugged caressed relationship goes serious evolution begins immune system natural killer cells proliferate help keep cancer away cells reflect placental life gone well prepared properly menace dangers life nk cells protect serious disease quite primitive exist many cells developed immune system inadequate start well prepared onslaught trauma later need ask new question gestation gone also implantation life beginning placental life gone even see viable natural killer cells found mammals enhance cells one year therapy may go back patient beginnings life cells deficient start therapy deficient year therapy need refine research make note first line primals patients greatly increased nk cells seems enhanced nk development around time critical period placental receptivity uterus greatest stockpile nk cells may early trauma impedes proliferation making susceptible disease later placenta powerhouse chemistry adds hormones normally produced elsewhere pituitary includes stress hormone cortisol home environment used thinking comes womb life bad home life creates serious problems later home far important later home life childhood terms diseases befall serious traumas mother depressed anxious start change stress hormone output placenta eventually may translate diseases alzheimer decades later wonder great amount cortisol produced key reason i think combat intrusion trauma ways placenta acts like relationship thalamus cortex allowing certain input rejecting others placenta pretty much like switchboard careful monitor amount quality nutrients rejecting certain pathogens tries keep healthy environment fetus times keeps infections mother often blocks cancer developing cells strange mother child exchange cells part part finally exciting placental cells also life saving stem cells saying i become anything want long love me take care me keep me healthy rewarded cells help give life attack disease one smoking pregnant live non polluted milieu eat properly every minute mother blood supply flows placenta see loke oxygen exchange enhanced something goes badly early pregnancy lead many afflictions immediate pre eclampsia miscarriage later perhaps cancer deeply hidden sources disease understand never fully resolve pain neurosis deal obvious never understand non obvious unobvious produces much damage obvious shattering pain pushes gating system action gates remain closed lifetime closed gates goes memory makes mystery non obvious pre eclampsia often considered placental disease precursor high blood pressure afflictions imagine specialists treating disease without reference early life one take blood pressure medication life causes known immune system incompatibility parents beginnings miscarriage later immune problems allergies placenta tells symptoms something went terribly wrong placental life shouts life trauma mother drinking smoking symptoms autobiography beginnings foretell diseases come let never neglect psychotherapy must learn address mysterious world find answers many problems
