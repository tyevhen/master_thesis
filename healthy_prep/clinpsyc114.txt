recent study journal biological psychiatry claimed show effexor venlafaxine alleged advantages ssris may public health relevance unstated article accurate reading findings antidepressants yield little benefit placebo i breaking two parts current post deals authors claims regarding venlafaxine superiority ssris second post examine understated finding antidepressants particularly impressive compared placebo study meta analysis data clinical trials comparing effexor ssri pooled together authors used remission hamilton rating scale depression ham measure treatment effectiveness ham score less equal used define remission found remission rates effexor greater remission rates ssris thus one would need treat depressed patients effexor rather ssri yield one remission would occurred patients received ssri big difference say authors said pooled effect size across comparisons venlafaxine versus ssris reflected average difference remission rates reflected nnt one would expect treat approximately patients venlafaxine see one success treated another ssri although difference reliable would important applied populations depressed patients also true modest might noticed busy clinicians everyday practice nonetheless nnt may public health relevance given large number patients treated depression significant burden illness associated disorder emphasis public health relevance remission public health claim pretty far top one treat patients effexor prevent suicide homicide would occurred ssris used yes talking significant impact public health dealing study outcome variable remission ham soft squishy measure convenience authors state remission rates rigorous measure antidepressant efficacy knowledge evidence supporting adoption magic cutoff score ham definition depressed depressed people scored ham really significantly depressed people scored take look ham make decision i know single piece empirical data stating small differences meaningful i buying public health benefit fact i think patently ridiculous outcome measures either categorical remission remission continuous change ham scores pretest posttest joanna moncrieff irving kirsch discuss using cut scores categorical measures rather looking mean change continuous measures result categorical measure making treatment appear much effective examination continuous measures applied case one wonders data mean improvement provided one make weak case effexor works better ssris based arbitrary categorical measure one shred data presented show superiority continuous measure data supported effexor categorical continuous measures i bet would discussed article funded wyeth patent holder effexor thus absence data continuous measures difference mean improvement ham effexor treated patients ssri treated patients suspicious even authors decided use categorical measures would nice opted use multiple measures could used equally arbitrary improvement criterion ham scores drop treatment example however data provided authors decided use one highly arbitrary measure found small benefit venflafaxine placebo whoopee i received email respected psychiatrist shall remain anonymous study opined would interesting authors used cutoffs hamilton scale besides define remission i done sensitivity analysis apparently wyeth raw data studies lot interesting science could done large aggregate database example robust factor analyses hamilton scale indicate reasonably independent dimensions depressed mood agitation anxiety diurnal variation etc would great interest determine relative effects various drugs different illness dimensions words authors could attempted see meaningful differences effexor ssris important variables yet opted undertake analysis skeptical view analyzed data fashion found nothing thus reported good news effexor i know conducted additional analyses reported however would seem me someone wyeth would run analyses point perhaps part meta analysis advantage ssris would make excellent marketing copy fact effexor running better ssris line years based rather scant data impressive data would reported prozac rest findings showed effexor superior statistically significant degree i expect differences chance alone compared prozac fluoxetine authors credit pointed multiple occasions however reporting seems little contradictory one hand report venlafaxine superior ssris class see quote toward top post note differences statistically significant compared prozac percentage difference remission favoring effexor zoloft sertraline paxil paroxetine celexa citalopram luvox fluvoxamine i think anyone would concur difference versus fluvoxamine seems high credible based one study making fluke factor tenable advantage effexor ssris except prozac statistically significant even differences statistically significant would authors claim needing treat patients effexor rather celexa achieve one additional depression remission would improve public health small differences soft squishy arbitrary endpoint combined performing reporting meaningful data news editor piles press release editor journal article appears jumped board big way acknowledging seemingly small advantage john krystal editor biological psychiatry affiliated yale university school medicine va connecticut healthcare system comments article highlights advance may importance public health individual doctors patients explains reasoning average doctor actively treating symptomatic depressed patients switched venlafaxine ssri patients would predicted benefit switch signal benefit might hard doctor detect imagine entire population depressed patients united states estimated population million people received treatment effective conceivable million people would respond venlafaxine would responded ssri may example optimal use existing medications may improve public health even might make much difference individual doctors patients seeing journal editor swallow kool aid encouraging difference based
