i get carried away answer question likely yes benign supplement based studies reviews i melatonin used treat insomnia sleep disorders nobody seems report major side effect even high doses taken periods time reviews lot qualifiers example say doses mg per night range unlikely cause major side effects others suggest even though melatonin use widespread large clinical trials assess long term safety probably never people ask me safety melatonin exactly i tell individual use counter melatonin varies greatly average self administered dose i encounter days milligrams range outliers high side nobody uses mg mg tablets people using mg concerns come number perspectives first issue normal excretion melatonin pharmacokinetics second role melatonin systems body third question toxicology melatonin case supplements presumed toxicology often based exposure large numbers people supplement alarming immediate side effects melatonin ubiquitous tissues body gives impression may benign compound hand metabolite ht serotonin additional implications ht highly politicised molecule unquestionable roles human physiology pharmacology i start think general approach problem first thing i look physiological levels melatonin might blood csf published medical literature area seem scant normal levels often determined part experimental intervention like peripheral sympathectomy one study normal diurnal fluctuations noted peak ranges peak plasma levels varied pmol l peak csf levels pmol l study authors demonstrated bilateral ganglionectomy abolished diurnal rhythms resulted lower levels melatonin suggesting peripheral sympathetic nervous system input melatonin secretion studies looked effects melatonin supplementation plasma csf levels always important average natural melatonin secretion humans mg per day i previously indicated supplementation many times early study showed oral melatonin supplementation led rapid increases blood csf melatonin authors also compared ratio cfs blood melatonin noted constant supplementation suggesting blood source csf melatonin recent studies suggest melatonin secreted directly third ventricle pineal recess may central peripheral compartments melatonin different effects recent comprehensive review pharmacokinetics melatonin authors reviewed high quality studies looking oral iv dose ranges mg mg cmax maximum plasma concentration following dose ranged ml mg iv pg ml mg oral tmax time peak plasma concentration ranged mg min mg half life ranged mg iv min mg oral response melatonin insomnia unpredictable dose response curve determined course wide range available melatonin preparations pharmacies health food stores even research often difficult say preparation used bioavailability quoted sleep research melatonin shows clinician know weak sleep effects variability exist people notice little effect claim knocked strongly sedated even next day effect hard reconcile short half life lack dose response curve makes difficult determine dosing review authoritative sleep text says studies use dose mg timing dose hours sleep may important factor i advised myself sleep expert mg dose melatonin hours sleep may optimal entrains circadian rhythm individual seen work many cases weak effects sleep eeg me suggest strong placebo component getting back side effect issue i surprised find pages melatonin last
