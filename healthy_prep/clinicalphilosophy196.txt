donald davidson gave reason thinking reasons causes julia tanney killed argument reports death greatly played i want start put right also challenge successor argument bill child davidson starts acknowledging rationalising force reason giving coming understand something developing grasp makes sense simply conflated causal explanation however tells reflecting certain examples see rationalising force reasons enough explain explanatory potency leads prima facie implausible idea reason explanation i turned tap i could water geraniums despite univocary appearance actually amalgam rationalising causal powers examples cases someone might two reasons action nevertheless one makes case one reason eventuates action causation davidson says glue binds reason reason representation actor mind 'primary set beliefs desires reason agent action davidson however made mistake need rationalisation let start acknowledging davidson would may one reason given someone indeed two reasons performing action best question ask tanney suggests i remember rightly paper i read years ago 'what binds 'operative reason action 'what renders reason inoperative ask latter question find latter inoperative

causes rationality action given actual preferences revealed reason explanation makes manifest bill child tried another tack making case reasons considered causes putatively non causal explanation event always make davidsonian point knowing story allows fit event pattern potentially makes sense still left wanting know event actually occurred made happen later suggests wrong think davidsonian argument depends idea cases agent acts one two equally strong reasons point argument need understand 'because 'she phi believed p suppose never case two equally good reasons action performs one still
