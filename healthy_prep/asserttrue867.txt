interesting discussion going theserverside right someone asked strangest thing java platform i think lot strange things java space precludes full enumeration offhand i say one disturbing aspects java ill behaved unpredictable system gc method according sun system gc reliable control returns method call virtual machine made best effort recycle discarded objects notice wording best effort absolutely guarantee gc actually force garbage collection well known anybody actually tried use anger problem rare case actually need use gc really need work least behave well understood deterministic way otherwise ca make serious use mission critical application put fine point method guaranteed expect seems me method becomes quite dangerous i know i rely system calls work ca rely system call rely suppose written reentry program spacecraft absolute need particular routine fire retro rockets execute without interruption starting particular point time spacecraft lost mission fail cost taxpayers million retro rockets fire time shut time imagine program fireretrorockets method entered jvm decides stop world garbage collect houston well know point could call system gc ahead time count exactly want collect garbage immediately uncommanded gc wo happen wrong moment could save mission arguably obviously example somewhat academic one right mind would actually use java program spacecraft real life i think says great deal java platform
