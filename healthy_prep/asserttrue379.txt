something strange happened day i fooling around looking flagellum genes various organisms hoping find homology bacterial flagellum proteins eukaryotic cilia proteins sudden search came back positive bacterial gene rice things lark i decided check one gene transferred maybe i reasoned late night going bed i downloaded dna sequence data genes enterobacter cloacae subsp cloacae strain nctc set brute force blast search bacterial genes genes oryza sativa l ssp indica i set value threshold stringent value allowed cogeblast interface namely meaning reject anything one chance matched chance i went bed expecting search turn nothing one flagellum protein match i found earlier i woke next morning i stupefied find brute force blast dna sequence search brought back high quality hits rice genome i later found bacterial genes acidovorax common rice pathogen enterobacter known pathogen rice although isolated rice get impression kind major scientific find let me cut suspense right telling bottom line many days checking rechecking data i longer think really hundreds horizontally transferred bacterial genes lurking rice genome oh sure genes data check actually sad case garbage rubbish oryza sativa indica genome i convinced suffers sample contamination say bacterial cells present rice sample prior sequencing bacterial genes amplified got contigs assembly software dutifully spliced bacterial data rice data first tipoff possibility contamination aside finding several hundred bacterial genes bacterial genes came i ran blast searches using date copy indica genome suddenly many hits i seeing vanished recent genome consists chromosome sized contigs earlier genome i using chromosomes plus scores tiny orphan contgis orphan contigs went away hits i looked ncbi master record oryza sativa indica group i noticed footnote near bottom page contig aaaa suppressed feb may contaminant actuality great many contigs removed well i ran tests sequenced rice genome oryza sativa japonica group genome i found bacterial genes contamination continues plague indica group genome official chromosomes oryza sativa indica acidovorax genes place day i suppose technically possible genes represent instances horizontal gene transfer easily biggest transfer across species lines ever recorded happened indica variety rice japonica two varieties diverged years ago following table shows acidovorax genes found oryza satisva indica group genome means complete list note identities number far right column pertains dna sequence similarity amino acid sequence similarity acidovorax genes ocurring published oryza sativa indica genome query gene function rice gene query coverage identities aave phospho dehydro deoxyheptonate aldolase osi aave orotate phosphoribosyltransferase osi aave lipoate protein ligase osi aave ff atp synthase subunit osi aave ff atp synthase subunit beta none aave ff atp synthase subunit epsilon osi aave twitching motility protein osi aave general secretory pathway protein osi aave nadh ubiquinone plastoquinone oxidoreductase chain osi aave nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain l osi aave deda protein dsg protein osi aave hypothetical protein osi aave histidine kinase internal region osi aave hypothetical protein osi aave penicillin binding protein osi aave hypothetical protein osi aave major facilitator superfamily transporter osi aave tetrahydropyridine carboxylate succinyltransferase osi aave ferrochelatase osi let lesson diy genome hackers everywhere find think dozens putative horizontally transferred genes large genome stop consider likely occur massive horizontal gene transfer event involving several dozen genes crossing another life form contamination lab sample bacteria i think know answer many thanks professor jonathan eisen davis providing valuable consultation
