trained medicine find observations surprising nearly years since i medical school findings come findings go interestingly theory i first heard biochemistry professor charged organizing medical students discussion seminars would critique research time broad spectrum journals final advice every class make sure kept reading new england journal medicine reason many people inaccurate view science especially applies medicine think science supposed true belief system fact science process initial theories supposed subject debate replication look closely discussion paper looks correlative research invariably find researchers saying research suggestive needs replication short time i writing blog asthma treatments swan ganz catheter diagnosis treatment acute bronchitis acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease clear examples theories research old standard care necessarily change time becoming increasingly obvious reproducible research short supply ioannidis provided six corollaries original paper first regarding power effect size greater number relationships tested greater design flexibility relatively straightforward last two corollaries focused subjectivity less accessible i think common reading research look technical aspects paper statistics involved forget human side equation paper th corollary follows corollary greater financial interests prejudices scientific field less likely research findings true conflicts interest prejudice may increase bias conflicts interest common biomedical research typically inadequately sparsely reported prejudice may necessarily financial roots scientists given field may prejudiced purely belief scientific theory commitment findings many otherwise seemingly independent university based studies may conducted reason give physicians researchers qualifications promotion tenure non financial conflicts may also lead distorted reported results interpretations prestigious investigators may suppress via peer review process appearance dissemination findings refute findings thus condemning field perpetuate false dogma empirical evidence expert opinion shows extremely unreliable reference typical conflict interest arguments seen medicine financial conflict interest current reporting database believed may considerable commentary nature earlier month speaks non financial side conflicts interest primary focus

behavior originates say institutions benefit perverse incentives lead researchers accumulate markers scientific achievement rather high quality reproducible work want institutions take corrective steps toward research highly reproducible one area bias ioannidis nature commentators light political biases seem preferentially affect psychiatry reputable scientists affected many factors previously
