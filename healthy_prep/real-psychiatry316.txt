i madison wisconsin second annual university wisconsin clinical update i reviewed first conference last year anyone unfamiliar conference started last year replacement long running conference run john greist md james jeff jefferson md acknowledged year contributions psychiatric education good conference builds tradition actual venue monona terrace convention center shore lake monona excellent modern facility one drawback charge high speed wireless access i talked many psychiatrists attended previous conferences long time bring speakers top experts fields depth presentations also strong department wisconsin headed ned kalin md conference wraps day half seems like good length working psychiatrists combine accessible speakers excellent course syllabus i consider elements good educational experience bonus i never really seen unbalanced presentation conference overarching message number interventions treatment successful scientific basis psychiatrists i thought i would make comments day move day first lecture given maria oquendo md neurobiology assessment treatment suicidal behavior aleman denys called investigation suicide special problem apart particular diagnosis began review epidemiology suicide including fact suicides psychiatric disorder also discussed converse statement vast majority patients psychiatric disorders never attempt suicide statement usually discussed parallel argument violence aggression psychiatric disorders implications care based dangerousness threat aggression suicide presented interesting stress diathesis model suicidal behavior takes account clinical features impulsivity cognitive inflexibility substance use family history poor social support neurobiological features low serotonin decreased noradrenergic na neurotransmission inflammatory markers model links norepinephrine neurotransmission pessimism cited evidence included slide crh innervation na neurons behavioral models lead na depletion animals reviewed evidence inflammatory signaling related childhood adversity mechanism interferon alpha induced depression markers inflammation suicide attempters versus controls increased interleukin il tumor necrosis factor

discussion public health approaches preventing suicide specific recommendations psychiatry fits response apart presenting data increased antidepressant prescriptions led decreased suicide rates sweden hungary japan slovenia also discussed specific psychotherapeutic interventions suicide name presented study cognitive behavioral therapy led reduction suicide attempts dr oquendo also provided excellent contrast results observational studies meta analyses double blind placebo controlled studies differ biases may effect case lithium preventing suicidal behavior clinicians aware fact lithium clozapine consider medications prevent suicide case lithium turns data observational studies meta analyses double blind placebo controlled trials two double blind studies suggest lithium effective preventing suicides agents suggested one bias may tendency clinicians use lithium people use safely led fewer suicide attempts i found presentation suicide suicide assessment interesting broad topic single lecture pick focus presentations suicide i seen tend focus trying figure people attempt suicide interventions populations people psychosis suicidal ideation common clinical scenario psychiatrists generally left would definitely complicate presentation couple levels issue happens usual risk factor analysis especially case subtle forms psychosis factors typically seen reliable deterrents suicide prevention plans thrown situation since patient marked change conscious state true whether patient clinically interviewed given structured interview like ccrs case psychotic individuals paranoia also risk factor suicidal behavior paranoia focused particular situation individual believes tortured killed someone develop plan kill rapidly using highly lethal method happen common scenario knife handgun nightstand case becomes necessary treatment situations preferred course treatment address depression psychosis time past studies populations also suggest high levels hypothlamic pituitary adrenal hpa axis activation consistent dr quendo model roger mcintyre md followed practical considerations successful treatment bipolar depression seems fairly widespread confusion diagnosis bipolar disorder i think common consulting subspecialty psychiatrists reverse diagnosis bipolar disorder often make new diagnosis dr mcintyre made point said misdiagnosis still problem even era overdiagnosis took assessment notch discuss utility limitations diagnostic issues bipolar qualifiers dsm mixed features anxious distress imply diagnosis treatment also emphasized need time assessment appreciates fact primary care physicians may little minutes make mood disorder diagnosis said even specialty clinic may know diagnosis patient lengthy assessment made point illustrate many patients single cross sectional view symptoms clinic appointment insufficient make correct diagnosis presented excellent graphic showing dsm continuum manic manic mixed features depressed mixed features depressed also spent fair amount time discussing treatment comorbid anxiety significant morbidity bipolar disorder presented interesting data comorbid medical psychiatric conditions bipolar disorder rule rather exceptions main focus metabolic syndrome obesity migraine headaches presented good graphics mechanisms associated comorbidities made point metabolic abnormalities much like studies done patient schizophrenia never treated medications associated number social metabolic environmental factors suggested obesity major depression obesity bipolar disorder phenotypes carried specific risks including poor cognitive performance anxiety symptoms case depression possible higher suicide risk cited estimates metabolic syndrome ranging form populations bipolar disorder compared general population estimate nhanes iii study presented interesting data correlation cognitive impairment obese overweight bipolar patients demonstrated first episode manic patients obese versus non obese molecular level demonstrated gradient inflammatory markers obese non obese bipolar patients published paper looks relationship treatment response depression body weight although speculate exact mechanism suggested altered brain systems involved cognition many patients section dr macintyre lecture included interesting graphic fda ema european medicines agency approved medications bipolar manic bipolar depressed maintenance therapy agencies approved quetiapine bipolar fda approved lurasidone olanzapine fluoxetine combination ofc number medications approved columns ema fda presented number needed treat nnt number needed harm nnh analyses ofc quetiapine lurasidone analysis lurasidone looked like superior medication analysis specific side effects nnt nearly identical medications terms overall treatment general agreement florida medicaid drug therapy management algorithm one interesting points made presentation treating preventing recurrent manic episodes may reduce risk alzheimer dementia potentially confounded effect lithium gsk induced tau phosphorylation lithium pearls several lectures claim lithium one two medications prevent suicide based observational studies meta analyses two double blind studies looking issue negative experts continue use lithium consider one major treatments bipolar disorder lithium may provide benefit manic prone patients long periods stability positive family history day dosing recommended lithium used pregnancy given several specific precautions informed consent issues including precautions time delivery prevent elevated lithium levels newborn lithium may decrease risk alzheimer disease minimal cognitive impairment afternoon breakout sessions various topics final presentation ned kalin md neurobiology depression point disclosure i know dr kalin first fellow university wisconsin back i completed residency model clinical researcher seen patients entire career also involved basic science research several department members wisconsin engaged balance clinical scientific activities i learned also president elect society biological psychiatry uw always active primate research dr kalin discussed important ethical scientific issues basic science research non human primates including reason primate research changes standards research settings years broadened research years include depression anxiety start childhood adolescence posted interesting graphic deaths worldwide due violence suggested suicide top cause followed homicide warfare based world health organization data showed experimental data
