biologist i find darwin theory hugely disappointing better alternative believe magic basically much sadly charles darwin died mendel proved existence genes scientific theories go theory evolution easily weakest major scientific theories commendable piece work ability stir discussion terrible ways useful scientific theory minimum two things explain observed provide testable predictions darwin theory weak first count useless second evolutionary theory explains practically nothing every explanation theory rooted survival fittest circular notion utterly content free fittest means able survive survival fittest means survival survive ironically darwin landmark work called origin species yet actually explain speciation except vacuous speculative terms course ca set high expectation darwin since live see publication mendel work word genetics would exist years darwin death still speciation portrayed darwin outcome accumulation small gradual changes explanation offers explanation wrong least accord well facts explain cambrian explosion example sudden appearance intelligence hominids rapid recovery net expansion biosphere wake least five super massive extinction events recent earth existence one frustrating aspects evolutionary theory fault theory though hard test laboratory fact one ever seen speciation happen laboratory repeatable conditions happens distinct disadvantage understanding speciation incidentally i count plant hybridization breeding anomalies fruit flies whose sexuality control microbial endosymbionts examples speciation i school taught mutations dna driving force behind evolution idea thoroughly discredited overwhelming majority non neutral mutations deleterious reduce increase survival mutations lead loss function easily demonstrated lab gain function evolutionary theory great explaining things like loss eyesight cave dwelling creatures bats terrible explaining gain function even mutations capable driving evolution simply happen fast enough account observed rates speciation bacteria measured rate rrna divergence due point mutations per million years yet flowering plants earth recently million years ago take biologist see disconnect i bring i spent time recently genomics research aimed exploring mechanisms new protein creation differentiation mechanisms relying wholly even mainly point mutations i wanted set stage discussing research next week i presenting new ideas findings hopefully put much needed flesh darwin exploring testable notions new protein motifs arise quickly without reliance magic
