couple papers came attention week relate i consider real evolutionary psychiatry evolutionary reasons might genes make vulnerable psychiatric disorders real evolutionary psychology academics consider discussion abnormal psychology like evolutionary psychology somewhat controversial i actually think disorders much evolving evolutionary light i tend think terms human body gut neurons working outside design specs thus breaking version evolutionary psychiatry overlap one ev psych another deserves scrutiny certainly i make case often patients particularly bipolar adhd ocd elements disorders quite adaptive certain situations long maladaptive parts derail everything part major hypothesis industrial digital age processed low nutrient food brought severe different phenotypes underlying vulnerabilities also brought seemingly new illnesses atypical depression thus less destructive phenotype mildly paranoid schizotypal person example creative average person compared full blown schizophrenia impairs functioning terrible extent persist population due selective advantage certain traits previous article real evolutionary psychiatry found creative advantage well fitting first two papers today comes medical hypothesis melissa mcewen sent me i think likes journal crazy makes laugh advice aspiring published purpose medical hypotheses publish interesting theoretical papers journal consider radical speculative non mainstream scientific ideas provided coherently expressed i publications myself though i assisted research efforts mentor would like me cobble something together research i done blog affective disorders something i never fancy myself much academic thus never felt motivation write anything boring enough published journal however would certainly add street cred i know i write exotic papers medical hypothesis however melissa sent me paper previously sort reptile origin theory illness i ca remember hysterical must slipped part editorial process also mostly incoherent back evolutionary psychiatry evolutionary origin bipolar disorder revised eobd r paper question one julia sherman madison wisconsin quick google search brings original eobd sans r much i make light medical hypothesis i admire originality paper noting wildly speculative basic premise likely incorrect ms sherman connects dots circadian rhythm issues vulnerability bipolar disorder manic episodes known peak spring time light increases exponentially day day extremely northern southern latitudes nutshell eobd suggests bipolar disorder developed adaptive trait northern temperate zones extreme winters ice age hypomanic spring summer got lot stuff done could slow hibernate depressed winter use much energy r revision question actually brings interesting bit neanderthal dna non san bushmen otherwise directly derived africa without side stepping europe asia coming close personal hominids seem ms sherman thinks bipolar disorder neanderthal trait hmmm brings observations german psychiatrist early th century kretchmer noted folks bipolar disorder tended certain pyknic constitutional type thick trunk relatively short limbs big head short thick neck apparently several researchers early th century really measuring heads body sizes making silly claims based measurements found manic depressive patients likely pyknic endomorphs schizophrenics likely leptosomic ectomorphs much newer study also confirmed finding sherman believes striking neanderthals also described big bellies short limbs interesting addition people african descent apparently lower incidence bipolar disorder studies sherman cites however reliable data among truly purely african populations san paper i hit highlights i entirely sure think question bipolar disorder seasonal component light dark therapies useful hypomania extended bursts drive energy creativity also adaptive one imagine moderately depressed cold dark winter might keep small tribe neanderthal hair might nothing much anyway i think pyknik bit little ridiculous know actually schizophrenia bipolar disorder related metabolic syndrome even people never medicines i also would bet poodle san bushmen bipolar disorder symptoms might attenuated latitude hunter gatherer lifestyle plenty socialization exercise though like omega filled mongongo nuts according wildly speculative theorizing second paper far less imaginative published much staid journal affective disorders creativity affective temperaments non clinical professional artists empirical psychometric investigation researchers looked undergraduates art school creative majors vs undergraduates majors predicted lead professions mostly requiring application learned rules like accounting i suspect students tested several standard measures detect subclinical clinical manifestation cyclothymia mild variation bipolar disorder also scales general health demographic data i think surprise anyone know creative students significantly likely score cyclothymic range scales interesting quote paper positive mood happiness particular postulated fuel creativity enhanced positive affect feature hypomania mania core symptoms bipolar disorder may predispose people within manic depression bipolar disorder spectrum creativity contrast postulated depression might provide fresh insights executed artistic oeuvre energized phases cyclothymia appears bipolar disorder linked creativity may adaptive advantage i think particularly controversial nice see studies subject neanderthals creative homo sapiens least springtime might help julia sherman hypothesis edited add neanderthal winter love song primitive radio gods right click open new tab
