last two posts i explored theory hyperglycemia might one predisposing factors developing alzheimer dementia epidemiological studies looked pretty solid though know strict reliance epidemiology cause ridiculous things eating boneless skinless chicken breasts even worse veggie burgers least plausible biochemical mechanism high levels insulin could interfere enzyme clears away amyloid brain thus allowing amyloid build plaques unfortunately smaller studies autopsy studies dr steve parker linked comments seemed show link alzheimer diabetes best hypothesis i could come data papers posts perhaps combination genetic predisposition alzheimer carrying apoe allele diabetes could put one higher risk people apoe seem lower amounts enzyme clear away amyloid first place add lots insulin got plaque city hyperglycemia alone going explain though everyone agrees hyperglycemia rotten brain cause alzheimer truth told whole cascade things played decades beta amyloid peptide definitely key player certainly one begins amyloid aggregating vulnerable areas brain called plaques takes years years followed accumulations tau protein called tangles plaques tangles i residency holy war going different sects brain researchers important plaques tangles seem interact inflammatory cells way accumulated plaques tangles finally trigger diffuse brain toxicity neuronal death beginning measuring amyloid predict problems even someone experiences first clinical stage alzheimer called mild cognitive impairment mci cognitive decline seems triggered tau protein increases recap long symptomless amyloid buildup tau takeover inflammation neuron destruction boom alzheimer dementia researchers looking amyloid ran problems example long interest developing vaccine amyloid sounds awesome right zap alzheimer immune system however time amyloid accumulated alzheimer proportions unlikely vaccine could reverse course disease vaccine trials trials drugs lower amyloid production even showed reversal plaque build autopsy patients still demented despite zapping plaques wanted stop alzheimer targeting amyloid would need start decades earlier one wants take experimental preventative anti amyloid medicine without safety track record lifetime least i however brings interesting hypothesis low carbers paleo diet enthusiasts kitavans anyone avoids hyperglycemia could preventing amyloid build long prodromal stage thus possibly reducing risk later alzheimer types frontal temporal dementias humans involve tau protein amyloid required treatment hypothesis focused amyloid missing big part picture sorry plaque researchers looking combat alzheimer later stages disease mild cognitive impairment beyond need fight brain inflammation tau protein tangle accumulation brain inflammation part mediated oxidative damage free radical ions roaming around taking proteins fats brain dna known quite leading lots research vitamin known antioxidant alzheimer preventative works great certain types mutant mice lousy experimental trials humans mci alzheimer vitamin may quite specific enough lots alpha tocopherol vitamin might even deplete self made antioxidant gamma tocopherol meaning much oral vitamin could pro oxidant oops gets interesting kitavans certain evolutionary minded psychiatrists inflammation alzheimer dementia linked eicosanoid production actual process dizzyingly complicated certain inflammatory markers il beta complement protein pro plaque tangle certain models disease anti plaque tangle times seems complement lead immune system chew plaques tangles appropriate inflammatory response whereas alzheimer brains late disease complement reactions way proportion likely worsen problem inviting bunch inflammatory fighting forces decimated neural battleground recall evolutionary medicine theory inflammatory cascade whack due horrible western dietary imbalance inflammatory anti inflammatory eicosanoid precursers omega omega polyunsaturated acids well one afraid unilever saturated fat ask people decrease omega consumption one could something chemically similar trying treat alzheimer nsaids naproxen ibuprofen like anti inflammatory prevention trial adapt looked first failure halted early safety concerns something interesting happened several years naproxen treatment halted two years study apparently treatment group significant reduction conversion alzheimer disease years naproxen stopped measurements treatment group csf time showed reduction tau amyloid ratio good increasing tau amyloid ratio one markers accelerating cognitive decline alzheimer studies shown reduction dementia long term use ibuprofen especially apoe carriers since long term nsaid use kill kidneys cause ulcers possibly heart attacks great strategy primary population based treatment alzheimer i prefer kitavan approach balance omega omega i go use omega treatment prevention alzheimer next post one thing kitavans island living may particularly stressful chronic expression inflammatory cytokine il interfere regulation hpa axis resulting unfortunate elevation glucocorticoids like cortisol discussed long term excess cortisol bad brain interestingly many alzheimer patients much cortisol called hypercortisolism fully explained damage hippocampus alzheimer excess cortisol may contribute insulin resistance problems energy regulation brain know energy everything comes helping sick brain boring thing evolutionary medicine prescription every problem stop sucking vast quantities omega eat diet wo promote obesity hyperglycemia get plenty sleep lots play avoid excess stress knows might eventually prove government panel wrong kitavans already maybe boring completely intuitive relatively simple awesome picture neurofibrillary tangle hyperphosphorylated tau protein
