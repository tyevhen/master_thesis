unfortunately good deal intrauterine trauma registered right brain becomes vain task use later developing left frontal brain gain access two universes apart i explained earlier speak two different languages start therapy patient rarely retrieves memories high life death valence laws evolution often permit repression job intended allows manageable fear first found way access depths unconscious orderly methodical fashion patient overwhelmed pain man microcosm universe therefore man clue universe certainly learn evolution brain observing patients therapy study day old baby rabbits deprived oxygen found radically lower precursors building blocks serotonin ht recover deficit found rabbits later offered prozac serotonin enhancer i sure would literally jump chance pun intended many animal studies show oxygen deprivation birth lowers set points serotonin research endless almost always conclusions early trauma including pre birth trauma alters serotonin neurotransmitter levels brain fetus develops normally inhibitory serotonin cells also develop orderly fashion trauma carrying mother husband leaves home interferes process later baby adult suffers panic anxiety attacks appear blue perhaps understand origins see newborns whose bodies express restlessness often non cuddly babies one reason evolution left frontal cortex produce brain system could distance areas nervous system painful feelings lie way overwhelmed lay get life deal daily problems brain system uncouple massive damaging input human part disengage lizard head brain water longer communicating together another important reason evolution left hemisphere left frontal cortex evolved use tools left frontal area involved precise tool use example hammering nail precision become domain left frontal area looking good surgeon find one left brain dominant assured precise want therapist feel sense things may want right brain dominant individual course someone balanced brain always ne plus ultra actually born enough serotonin systems yes genetic born born think way take drugs boost serotonin prozac zoloft etc levels help repress anxiety pain mean anxiety due low levels serotonin like asking headaches occur due low levels aspirin really serotonin natural product something produce internally low indeed born low serotonin levels due epigenetics mother anxiety low serotonin levels help fetus donating supplies fetus pain basic need fulfilled example need safety feel safe untroubled child lives rageful parent never feels kind safety never really relax world becomes dangerous place pain compounded stark sterile unloving home could development delusions me want hurt me comes feeling safety anywhere one turn help soothing danger lurks outside also inside danger hard escape professionals never

making unable deal simplest task could handle additional pressure one obvious reason mother remained anxious pregnancy downloading baby baby substrate anxiety father menacing strong loud voice tended overreact especially fearful hence obedient overreacting means reacting different epochs early life different kinds trauma lack love layers feeling compounded time reacting current situation reacting also past trauma well parents take away dare disobey fearful start healthy baby would shake head say parents i want eat whereas child spent life anxiety filled womb dare say dreaded consequences triggering birth gestational traumas would overwhelming without theory takes account gestational life loss help patients kind person i describing someone refuse invitation discipline child say way parent could child say father normal levels serotonin could repress would anxiety panic attacks low serotonin means inadequate repression thus riddled impulses homicidal suicidal typically low neuro chemical means loss control anxiety starts life pure terror barely held back gating system gets transformed later phobias free floating fear able dampen variety defenses never less forceful originally let me state pure primal terror never changes defended filtered softened never changes internal effects biologic kept place reasons survival uses supplies inhibitory neurotransmitters suffering may exacerbated problem seems conception adulthood utilize serotonin manufacture animals shocked rendered helpless far lower serotonin levels diabolic traumas womb life cause use huge supplies serotonin compromise inhibitory repressive system make enough set point low forget takes almost half womb life make serotonin consciousness end anxiety consciousness means connection driving disconnected
