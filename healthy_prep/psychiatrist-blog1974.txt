standard peer reviewed journal seems like article ca make mind discuss really address legal issues involved drug related criminal prosecution incomplete discussion clinical studies frankly i left article feeling little bothered lack focus regarding clinical issues violence multifactorial behavior i think overly simplistic reduce simple medication cause effect confounding variables presence personality disorders previous acts violence active affective disorder symptoms co existing substance abuse know nothing confounding variables article clinical trial data useful identify strong associations could attributed medications eg weight gain increases prolactin levels less useful low base rate phenomena like homicide roy already pointed base rates general aggression low begin

began working lifted patient point able thoughts shifted patient bipolar mixed state simply ineffective treating depression incidental final given vast range odd side effects adverse reactions people get medications studies linking suicidal ideas children ssri extreme nature cases discussed plosjournal article probably reasonable say small percentage patients given ssri may become violent still bit stretch me also people history violence unpredictably kill someone becomes hard look correlation medication tens millions americans take medication kind like i eat twinkies i kill anyone

less irritable better able cope life throws simply cease depressed identify medication makes feel like old pre depressed self often people sexual side effects left make decision someone report violent ideas medication distressing side effect i would discontinue patient practice decision take take medications ultimately patient i discuss possible risks possible benefits i make recommendation based studies i read patient responses i witnessed i strongly encourage someone take medications ultimately i suppose i could refuse treat someone i felt i could help without medication final decision generally issue team work often patient comes predisposed i never taking meds prozac made best friend better i want stuff vignettes story striking date i felt need warn patients might become violent
