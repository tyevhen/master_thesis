i read shrink rap blog found recent post reaction one blog posts violation people feel psychiatric hospitalization direct attack author certainly predictable especially given sources quoted article expected none author intentions captured responses intention explicitly stated following sentences i realize people involuntarily hospitalized terribly traumatized i writing book i think psychiatrists see i think figured equation maybe less people would involuntarily hospitalized certainly one forcibly hospitalized 'sadness one mia commenters put alternatives could found effort would made treat options involuntarily hospitalized respect kindness i worked acute care inpatient setting treating acutely ill patients years thought i would give impressions statement psychiatrists see see people acutely hospitalized especially involuntary basis i think several critical factors determine experience like circumstances considerable variation experience based factors approached pre hospital experience units i worked voluntary admissions minority people brought emergency department ed police paramedics usually involved acute behavioral change leading safety issue pre hospital encounter people beaten maced tasered law enforcement happens person ed wearing handcuffs tight effect perception hospital staff following admission also extremely traumatizing experience years observing problem led me problem solve patients affected situations could avoid confrontations police source trauma prior admission fights accidents self inflicted injuries near death experiences suicide attempts accidental overdoses also happen prior admission cases people transferred intensive care units stabilized intoxication states intoxication states including alcohol cocaine amphetamines hallucinogens marijuana well associated drug induced mental disorders overrepresented population gets acutely involuntarily admitted people substance use disorders systematically discriminated insurance industry past thirty years time functional detoxification allowed patient intoxicated generally denied care psychiatric units companies even significant psychiatric disorder supposed go social detox county detox units least counties learned insurance companies cost effective resources deny care means today people never get sober likely increasing numbers encounters police takes
