recent opinion piece new york times george makari md me shaking head thesis recent headline grabbing story wrong criteria effects comprehensive treatment psychosis opposed treatment usual surprised many highlighted problem reductionism bemoans fact reaction story one surprise specify surprised i certainly surprised i attended recent meeting somebody audience asked daniel weinberger surprised response spent million dollars showing good treatment better bad treatment certainly surprised i heard eric kandel response based paper plasticity happens psychotherapy i doubt would surprised exact population might surprised findings seems poorly defined point time i doubt included psychiatrists speaking myself i elaborate i surprised one point i medical director community support program group outpatients state wisconsin according state statutes access program depended diagnosis degree psychiatric disability could apply diagnosis bipolar disorder major depression schizophrenia borderline personality disorder significant associated disability high risk hospitalization clinical goal program reduce hospitalizations maintain independent living facilitate employment program staffed psychologist social workers three nurses me i arrived one early dynamics frame problems terms medication needs translated increasing dose medication typically antidepressant antipsychotic crisis situations emotional crises patients program chronic problems symptoms necessarily respond medication one first steps start discuss problems solutions patients i met patients supportive psychotherapy possible team meetings every morning problem solved around needs patients community solve crises approach people ways medications i tracked total dose antipsychotic medication days hospitalization outcome measures end three years days hospital gone days per person less total dose antipsychotic medication gone total mg chlorpromazine equivalents point obviously comprehensive care patients severe problems results improved outcomes case lower doses medications used patients spent less time hospital time home orientation ability implement program accident i trained len stein md university wisconsin dr stein pioneer area defined community psychiatry motivated realizing people large state hospitals easy warehouse overcrowded conditions nobody seems recognize overcrowding suboptimal conditions state hospital equivalent managed care rationing state hospital spreadsheet state bean counter accountability patients families rationing fewer fewer resources order day community psychiatry seminar dr stein projected slide gymnasium sized room populated male patients hundreds cots aligned edge edge room walk cots motivation moving people state facilities housing i trained three programs independent living quality life primary goals staff involved programs good effort extended skill set contrary surprising results quoted study i thing back true known years comprehensive care psychiatric disorders trumps treatment usual rhetoric dr makari seems want make mind brain argument words biopsychosocial approach uncertain effect mind opposed brain based approach looks specific mechanisms action seems focused psychopharmacology points example highlighted study would possible qualify current nimh funding unless looked specific brain mechanisms throws around word reductionism anytime reductionistic reductionism used rhetorically sentence psychiatry pejorative old psychoanalytic teacher would refer anyone talked brain biology dial twister implication reductionists somewhat simple minded largely accept uncertainty dealing organ poorly defined inputs outputs kind double whammy rhetoric unsophisticated reductionist really ca see big picture things really simple arguments accurate problems equating reductionism bad course major problems first statement inherent proposition mental illness brain disease implication psychological social events somehow also brain events serious misreading definition plasticity experience dependent changes brain i give neurobiology brain lectures i use kandel original new england journal medicine article discusses brain changes patient therapist conducting psychotherapy changes associated brain plasticity i give examples weightlifting playing violin typical stream consciousness profoundly altered drug addiction neuroscientist biological psychiatrist i know would suggest psychological social events brain events numerous experimental paradigms look specifically events occur brains animals second aspect dr makari argument reductionism specific comment luck studies like dr kane undermine suppositions help move away narrow thinking embolden substantial community within psychiatry never accepted reductionism suppositions case mental illness brain disease social psychological events brain representation argument based false premise use term reductionism instructive previously noted definition reductionism applies many proposed etiologies psychiatric disorders etiologies studied molecular level higher level schaffer says model reductive employs standard biochemical molecular entities account psychiatric symptoms disorders non reductive models discuss causal connections higher levels aggregation illustrates definitions looking kendler non reductive account major depression kendler used path analysis look clinical variables relevant psychiatric disorders although i access one used book typical example model looks life stages familial factors psychological factors higher levels aggregation molecular mechanisms reductive side things examines harrison weinberger proposed genetic susceptibility genes schizophrenia time book written author limited discussion genes also looked continuum psychiatric genetic models ranging basic advanced genetic epidemiology non reductive gene finding partially reductive molecular genetics fully reductive seems perfectly logical me study brain biology proceeds way biology living organisms proceeds difference studying infinitely plastic organ significant computational power clearly lot phenotypic heterogeneity unexplained psychiatric diagnostic categories highly unlikely refining diagnostic descriptors applying clinical methods lead significant change diagnostic treatment process i understand reluctance go specific mechanisms treatments idea molecular clinical focus psychiatry problem psychiatric services also misleading i hoped point mental health center example psychiatrists know comprehensive care rarely able provide known provide decades state asylums became overcrowded therapeutic due financial management system state governments bean counters moved asylum integrated every level health care system strong bias comprehensive treatment mental illness insist patients severe psychiatric problems get comprehensive evaluations discharged adequately treated associated addictions poorly treated biases people hospitalized medical surgical illnesses effect moved poorly run overcrowded asylum model general health care system comprehensive care severe mental disorders system advertising phenomenon rather reality reductionism argument good new york times opinion pieces may sell papers get clicks online unfortunately perpetuates old pattern blaming people psychiatrists particular shortcomings non system mental health care country set favor large health care businesses blame psychiatrists want people realize real problems product business politics scientific interests psychiatrists nothing change
