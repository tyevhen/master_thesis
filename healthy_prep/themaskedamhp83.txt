reporting period doubt fairly recent addition powers mha popular psychiatrists applicants cto would problem cto indeed help patients maintain stable mental health outside hospital promote recovery evidence far somewhat equivocal march octet study cto published research selected detained patients diagnosis psychosis total sample consisted half sample discharged cto half made subject extended leave leave process whereby patient formally discharged detention mental health allowed hospital leave recalled time little formality object research see cto reduced readmission monitored samples
