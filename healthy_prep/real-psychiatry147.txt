debate dialogue like complex issue people opinions mirror political party lines people opinions interested changing people open dialogue practically dialogue seems focused high risk incidents happen matter seconds involve deadly force i seen neuroscientific ponderings unconscious implicit biases affect split second decisions i thought possible i went web site took tests involving implicit bias single case i could predict outcome ahead time based i already know myself me appeared unconscious bias operating decision since i white psychiatrist police officer i going suggest specific solutions

instead took average msec highly trained officers shot msec translated inexperienced suspects shooting first tying officers scenarios interesting article literature also suggests shooting errors high threat situations persist even weeks practicing scenarios comparison web site allows determination reaction time scenario completely free distractions noise like anxiety trying determine suspect
