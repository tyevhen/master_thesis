appearances phenotypes instead causes genotypes many new drugs market heralded breakthrough i discuss one recent one makes claim ketamine something used light anesthetic fifty years ago called twilight sleep claimed effective treatment depression question ketamine originally aimed horses veterinary medicine transferred humans yet legal treatment depression experimental studies reported quite effective first tried scientists national institute mental health thoughts suicide diminished depression eased time though long time period happens drug infused patient system feeling dissociation feeling drugged thoughts suicide diminished depression eased time though long term happens drug infused patient system feeling dissociation feeling drugged ketamine fill space neurons neurotransmitter glutamate producing flood drug prefrontal cortex helps activate mental activity making person better able handle feelings conclusion depression caused imbalance regulating action glutamate ketamine activate parts limbic system including anterior cingulate cortex sense upper gathering energy activating system basic repression deadness thus lifting depression remember anything eases repression help depression generally medication combat depression must energize repression short need soften massive repression involved depression help patients thus biochemical gaba gamma amino butyric acid works inhibit transmission nerve impulses partially undone ketamine thus lessening repressive work accomplished gaba diazgranados et al vutskits et al researchers believe imbalance responsible depression i believe need ask caused imbalance first place since effects ephemeral i believe need first discover right balance endures seems me might well early traumas disrupt much neurochemical balance brain depressives may low glutamate excessive activity became dangerous trauma birth shutting survival every breakthrough one key effect easing repression lifting gates since i posit depression repression elevated higher level would make sense easing repression would make permanent difference otherwise obliged work around edges tweaking symptoms never reaching causes
