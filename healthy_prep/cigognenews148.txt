first part series i wrote epigenetics primal therapy whole article publish soon activitas nervosa superior journal world psychiatry association activitas org sometimes i realize i getting science heavy happening today exciting especially since supports i writing almost years almost every week seems scientists announce new research confirming much primal position especially true burgeoning field epigenetics study experience changes individual genetic code previously considered inalterable article recapping groundbreaking work pioneering researchers mcgill university montreal proclaimed emerging field epigenetics revolutionizing study mental health challenging belief dna destiny moreover terms history science new developments augur convergence previously distinct fields psychology biology one report regarding research shows link early life adversity changes person genetic make canadian researchers come sweeping conclusion epigenetics could serve bridge social sciences biological sciences allowing truly integrated understanding human health behavior mcgowan szyf p short growing understanding mental illness crucial physical component basic tenet primal theory start always maintained neurosis disturbance mind body treatment mind body must involved cure science showing possible cellular level unlike genetic mutations researchers state epigenetic alterations potentially reversible mcgowan szyf p promising finding i discussed epigenetics blog books adversity early changes switches key genes serves compound repression inhibition switches turn gene thus help
