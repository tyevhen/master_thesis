wrong placebo controlled clinical trials transparency i imaginary meeting bunch internists psychiatrists debating available meager literature use trazodone sleep got one favorite topics double blind placebo controlled trial catch evidence based medicine dialogue went something like internist evidence double blind placebo controlled trials weak trazodone me i need double blind placebo controlled trial tell me prescribe trazodone sleep internist saying need evidence oh wait i conference head society stood gave evidence clinical trials limitations like subsequently proven true me i talking i talking hype people recover antidepressants better placebo internist algorithmic approaches show me yada yada yada every algorithm somebody meta analysis show wrong i talking ridiculous notion psychiatrists could stay business want stay business people treat got better true i would become recluse years ago walked away general laughter internist i would kill response rate problems i treat informal conversation among colleagues illustrative recent arguments focus physicians generally psychiatrists physicians treatments ineffective based oversimplified view placebo controlled clinical trials conflict interest many times clear points demarcation scientific issue technical aspects clinical trial ethical issue conflict interest issues may compromise scientific results read current technical problems clinical trials like common observation lack generalizability clinical populations compared highly selected trial sample case psychiatry generally much milder forms illness studied concerns i see discussed anywhere especially comes clinical trials psychiatric interventions crude state clinical trials clinical trials psychiatry tremendously unsophisticated trial result generally depends rating scale clinician global rating scale results grossly oversimplify condition measure parameters irrelevant clinical settings best example i think depression rating scales list dsm criteria depression apply likert dimension symptoms clinical practice common see hundreds patients score scale full spectrum disability absolutely none totally disabled population might likely exhibit antidepressant effect also common see medically ill patients insomnia may score mildly moderately depressed physically ill depressed problems exist clinical trials schizophrenia anxiety alzheimer disease weak technology combined selection process eliminates clinical populations severe illness surprising treatment studied weak effect weak clinical trials data base one clarion calls called evidence based medicine cochrane collaboration i looked hundreds reviews majority reviews medical psychiatric studies insufficient results methodologically unsound i suppose good somebody make statement proclaimed evidence based physician nothing go fact point stop going cochrane results fairly predictable even case result apply patient seeing i see many cochrane studies depressed patients right bundle branch block ventricular premature contractions complex atrial fibrillation common patients seen clinical practice many research papers i read conclude research needed continued inadequate trials published analyzed cochrane current trends political correctness evidence based medicine go forever practical aspects large costs trials real reason pharmaceutical companies big pharma sponsor trials political system decided farm clinical trials private profit companies exact manner government farmed management entire health care system systems big pharma absorbs disproportionate amount criticism relative managed care companies managed care equated medically necessary care care provided form pill politicalization clinical trials clinical trials psychiatric medications done days without eye politically relevant dimensions new antidepressant needs get many fda approved indications possible order beat political restrictions utilization review managed care companies would include indications depression anxiety panic social anxiety also chronic pain possibly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd best way beat utilization review fda approved indication class also applied atypical antipsychotics fact seems escape critics focus number prescriptions implies physicians pawns game suitable tolerated medications bipolar disorder depression atypical antipsychotics indication current political factors clinical trials preclude focus cognition functional capacity endophenotypes potentially much valuable focus diagnostic criteria rating scales based criteria characterization average physician ignorant best political movement associated ugly rhetoric clearly effort stampede physicians reservations evidence based medicine neanderthal category irony criticism often comes sources like managed care companies medical certification authorities press bloggers entities high levels conflict interest common rhetoric used psychiatrists want measured criticism originates government managed care company administrative authority often attached explicit threat days obvious implicit observation medicine psychiatry run people know anything medicine plenty evidence blog back many critics seem get lot mileage position seem particularly anointed criticize field seems especially true happen physician colleagues certainly seem bunch chumps therfore rejected wholesale basis course listen me enlightenment i never witnessed level incompetence group physicians i practiced across multiple settings use statistics rhetorical purposes stage reading research past years i convinced come meta analysis show whatever want show several years ago new england journal medicine study looked well meta analyses predict results available large scale clinical trials study showed times common see result see meta analysis disproves clinical trials result nobody seems interested looking detail sound meta analysis today large number questionably valuable clinical indicators quality care markers often based political rhetoric government managed care organizations may invalid face second equally important aspect organizations valid approach looking statistics longitudinal data look clinic results even results physician convert numerator denominator whether fraction means anything anybody guess administrator somewhere happy tell false assumptions expertise physicians much rhetoric focused physicians psychiatrists politically disenfranchised group frequent target past years endured ideas medical treatments prescribed ineffective overprescribed brings full circle opening imaginary conversation physicians trained focus several goals including acute treatment treatment chronic problems providing care dying psychiatrists physicians i pleasure working highly effective achieving goals i look modest results poorly designed clinical trials i shake head i would quit long time ago diagnostic treatment capabilities accurately described clinical trials physicians would informed clinical treatment series often rapid changes course rejecting poorly tolerated treatments looking things work better along way i change course treatment depicted clinical trial one day trial result carried end failure clinical trial evidence would predict treatment results mean treatment ineffective tolerated practice i stop treatment call person unsuccessful intent treat subject i work establish effective treatment often time frame clinical trial quite literally absurd suggest clinical trials accurately describe happen clinical practice yet state discourse false promise transparency anyone followed politics knows disclosing potential conflicts interest meaningless case politicians general idea politicians would refrain either accepting money sources involved politically involved area legislation reality happen sometimes politicians involved speak suggestion connection money receive legislative record even activities consistent financial conflict interest sunlight transparency many critics talk simply legitimizes ongoing involvement areas potential conflict interest disclosure stamp approval involvement researched congressional watchdog sites new cms web site posts payments doctors hyped way appease critics seem clueless transparency eye opener take look decision point conflict interest cms seems much charitable typical blogger politician journalist disclaimer sharing information financial relationships alone enough decide whether beneficial improper financial ties mean anyone anything wrong transparency shed light nature extent financial relationships hopefully discourage development inappropriate relationships given complexity disclosure importance discouraging inappropriate relationships without harming beneficial ones cms worked closely stakeholders better understand current scope interactions physicians teaching hospitals industry manufacturers lack appreciation regulatory environment rush condemn big pharma anyone associated critics often idealized version regulation minds access clinical trials data analyze would personally able hold big pharma feet fire allow drugs approved deemed safe effective smarter ethical anyone actual trials certainly smarter regulators minimum failure recognize pharmaceutical regulation political process like politically directed regulation broad goals safety efficacy relative regulatory mandate takes account blog i pointed several cases medications i scientific committee employed fda recommended based safety considerations approved fda many drugs i approved member pharmacy therapeutics committee p expensive minimal efficacy approved based political considerations small vocal advocacy group untreatable illness rather pure efficacy safety considerations regulatory environment currently designed get promising agents hands clinicians clinical use limited exposure patients clinical trials means rare serious side effects recognized post marketing surveillance occurs every person taking fda approved medication realize regulatory process designed provide perfect medications none lot say subject like detailed analysis politicalized version physicians work think nothing way physicians actually work think today i stopping life randomized double blind controlled clinical trial generally good thing
