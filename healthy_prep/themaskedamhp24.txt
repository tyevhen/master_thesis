service developed protocol referring circulated organisations may refer mha assessments among requirements patients unknown secondary services gp first seen patient considered alternatives patients known community teams unallocated team made efforts see assess patient first referrer must seen spoken patient patient must seen another professional worker advised concerns unless clear defensible reasons referrer clinical team leader team manager senior worker expected discussed referral senior member team order rule alternative support treatment options example referrer considered referral social care assessment carer assessment referrer considered made referral dementia intensive support team crisis resolution team avoid admission hospital person crisis contingency plan avoid admission implemented referrer considered discussed patient informal admission hospital consideration given use mental capacity guiding principles including issues capacity consent least restrictive alternatives detention mha considered brings me back initial statement beginning post mental health designed protect liberty human rights deemed mental disorder prevent coercion forced hospitalisation possible mental health assessment therefore last resort amhp service regarded emergency service statement may surprise many genuine cases emergency example someone standing top multi storey car park threatening jump getting amhp two doctors attend point would serve useful function immediate crisis resolved via emergency services code practice states first guiding principle least restrictive option always tried first possible treat patient safely lawfully without detaining patient detained wherever possible patient independence encouraged supported focus promoting recovery wherever possible para goes say commissioners providers relevant agencies work together prevent mental health crises possible reduce use detention prevention early intervention commissioning range services accessible responsive high quality health emergency services para protocol merely draws attention guiding principles mha particular para issuing guidance resulted fewer inappropriate referrals time hard pressed professionals faced lack accessible responsive resources still try desperation use amhp fill gaps
