italian neurophysiologist parma brain research using macaque monkeys specifically researching area brain called f located premotor cortex area f contains millions neurons specialize coding one specific motor behaviour actions hand including grasping holding tearing important bringing objects food mouth iacoboni explains every macaque actions basic essential come homo sapiens grasping manipulating objects moment fumble snooze button morning adjust pillows bedtime perform hundreds thousands grasping actions every day rizzolati team chose area f close investigation one day neurophysiologist vittorio gallese moving around lab lull monkey sitting quietly chair suddenly vittorio reached something heard burst activity computer connected electrodes surgically implanted monkey brain experienced neurophysiologist signalled discharge pertinent cells area f vittorio immediately thought strange monkey sitting quietly grasping anything yet neurons affiliated grasping action fired nevertheless many painstaking experiments neurophysiologist came discovery within f motor area dedicated neurons fire one performs action one watches someone else performing action grasping bringing objects usually food mouth kicking ball playing tennis etc even fire one simply hears word kick mirror neurons imitating grasping action fire even object grasped hidden view behind screen monkey knows object crucially mirror neurons involved predicting meaning certain action essential communicating relating others iacoboni says action recognition process implemented mirror neurons sort simulation internal imitation observed action given actions almost invariably associated specific intentions activation brain neurons i use perform actions may also allow me understand intentions people example i watch someone grasping cup soon argument person thanks mirror neurons i know whether grasping cup get drink whether throw cup me quiet simply mirror neurons differentiate action associated different intentions years experiments many different neurophysiologists mirror neurons thought involved much imitating motor actions one brain watching someone else performing motor action thought involved emotional bonding empathy language thought mirror neurons play role empathy capacity feel people emotions brain area connecting mirror neurons limbic system responsible emotions insula words feel understand emotions people thanks mirror neurons activated sight someone smiling frowning crying etc thus mirror neurons fire see others expressing emotions making facial expressions means firing neurons also send signals emotional brain centres limbic system make feel people feel essential empathy based mirror neurons people facial expressions trigger firing mirror neurons james james lange theory emotions phenomenon means mental life knit corporeal frame strictest sense term incidentally connection emotions po chinese medicine mirror neurons also play role development sense self social context critical developing sense self isolation seems inhibit ability develop sense self rich social context facilitates presence others continuous relations interactions one must others facilitates development sense self mirror neurons fire observe actions perform actions strong link social environment sense self link least partly due mirror neurons mirror neuron hypothesis relation autism autism imitation deficit i child unable translate perspective another individual one perspective believed key neural deficit autism dysfunction mirror neurons iacoboni says deeply felt mirroring moves people closer makes emotional connectedness possible seems main deficit patients autism chinese medicine particular shen hun i think interesting connections role shen hun mirror neurons shen hun together responsible emotional empathy relating others consider chinese ideogram shen right side ideogram interesting pronounced shen means express explain stretch extend last two meanings stretch extend crucial understanding shen responsible extending towards others connecting others emotional connection empathy words function mirror neurons however shen perform function alone relies help hun ancient books say shen hun related work unison yang nature opposed relation po jing yin nature hun help shen hun responsible different type consciousness shen responsible intuition planning life dreams ideas inspiration incidentally also artistic inspiration hun perform functions movement hun always moving sense searching exploring ideas nurturing life dreams etc without input hun shen would inert consciousness input hun therefore essential shen perform function relating connectedness others chinese medicine equivalent function mirror neurons movement hun right much little movement hun deficient person may become depressed movement hun excessive person may slightly manic i relate autism children deficient movement hun leads impaired function shen relating others seen related dysfunction mirror neurons conversely i relate hyperactivity children excessive movement hun interestingly hyperactive children often artistic function hun
