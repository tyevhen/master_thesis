interesting stuff fast really important amhp doctors completing mental health forms get right br whole detention could completely illegal ultimately could lead patient subject unlawful imprisonment could sue br sounds bad bad amhp drummed beginning importance filling forms correctly br using lot exclamation marks today masked amhp i sorry i getting bit excited i try avoid exclamation marks oops oops br calm cup chamomile tea tell me mental health hospital guardianship treatment regulations si states certain statutory forms used compulsory admissions legal aspects mha regulations give wording used forms br ah yes dreaded pink forms without amhp powerless new born kitten yes although forms pink see wording forms statutory forms could write hand wanted long used wording set regulations forms set information provided managers hospital order able legally receive detain patient code practice says regulations require specific statutory forms used certain applications recommendations decisions reports records forms set regulations para goes say people sign applications make supporting medical recommendations must take care comply requirements people authority documents also make sure proper form incorrectly completed indecipherable form may constitute authority patient detention br otherwise patient could sue asses i keen terminology essentially right i always tell amhp trainees fact anyone listen amhp responsibility assessment admission patient mental health end patient tucked hospital papers accepted reference guide states clearly detained patients treated admitted relevant application received behalf managers words assessment process end paperwork checked signed br make sure happens always best practice go least follow patient hospital leave someone authorised

advance long way away way scrutinised approved principle patient actually gets i done twice br form mistake make illegal necessarily rectifiable non rectifiable errors come cqc useful document called scrutinising rectifying statutory forms admission mental health gives examples errors rectified although bit vague comes defining non rectifiable errors document says documentary irregularities fall three broad groups incapable retrospective correction sufficiently serious render patient detention invalid may rectified within days admission rectified sufficiently serious render application invalid expiry period errors omissions even corrected within statutory period sufficiently serious render admission application invalid mha allows days rectifiable errors forms corrected br rectifiable errors usually fairly minor things like minor errors address name patient crossing things needed leaving blank spaces written something example might crossing bit application referring unable identify nearest relative fact identified nearest relative bigger errors two doctors clinical team providing recommendations long get another medical recommendation within days right br errors make detention invalid i already given one example failure sign form another fatal error another one would form completed someone authorised complete form example application made someone actually approved mental health practitioner another would using wrong forms i remember one particular admission i night duty called assessment gp however time i arrived patient home patient already gone hospital ambulance ambulance arrived hospital patient brought onto ward clutching single pink piece paper hand turned nearest relative application form nearest relative completed first part form gp written space back i certify person detained mental health signed br using exclamation marks sorry br ever made serious mistakes completing application masked amhp me masked amhp made serious mistake
