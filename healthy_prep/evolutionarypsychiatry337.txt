yesterday i made brief introduction topic ketogenic diets bipolar disorder today i want discuss issues raised post little thoroughly first let talk bit nerves work pretty cool really involves little biochem physics bear me picture courtesy government wikipedia nerve impulses signals travel along nerve fibers via electricity happens extracellular levels ions intracellular levels ions maintained different level inside neurons sodium concentration mm outside mm rather like bunch balls stored container top hill open little door side container balls come pouring hill potassium opposite levels high inside cells quite low outside neurons plasma membranes like cells bodies membranes somewhat like tarp oiled sides charged ions sodium potassium ca get unless go special ion pumps located cell membranes sodium pump fact may use energy brains result shenanigans nerve cell membranes left somewhat negatively charged mv fact neurotransmitters serotonin norepinephrine dopamine acetylcholine glutamate gaba etc work changing membrane potentials various ways neurotransmitters open ion channels allowing sodium enter cell causing wave electrical impulse travels along neuron neat electrical impulse action potential reaches end neuron presynaptic terminal neurotransmitters released space nerve cells called synapse part neuron calcium important ion though sodium plays role electrical impulse originally mediated sodium dendrite traveled nerve causes extracellular calcium pour cell leads release neurotransmitters synapse affect communication next neuron voila neurons sent messages one another yee haw sodium calcium membrane potential craziness set back baseline transport potassium everything set new signal sent friday i know important understand extent understand ketogenic diet might change ionic environment brains get ketogenic diet let look lithium carbamazepine valproic acid depakote medications anti seizure mood stabilizing properties lithium especially interesting recall looks lot like sodium much kidneys become confused seems brains rats treated lithium lithium displaces intracellular sodium neurons overall sodium decreased changed sodium gradient may central mood stabilizing effects lithium doctors squinting me right hey lithium anti seizure med well actually used used one psychiatrists know get away somewhat lower doses many medicines mood control neurologists need seizures exception depakote sometimes lithium horribly toxic levels high enough needed control seizures never used seizures anti seizure potential carbamazepine little mysterious one effects definitely inhibit voltage sensitive sodium channels lamotrigine another anti seizure mood stabilizing drug something similar valproic acid depakote whole load actions increase gaba making pretty good anti anxiety med another thing decrease rapid fire ability spazziest neurons probably inhibiting sodium channels get picture meds life saving bad bipolar disorder seizures pretty toxic host side effects work effectively insulators brain decreasing ability neurons send whack sodium messages leading neurotoxic calcium overload calcium overload speculated cause seizures also migraines bipolar symptoms anti seizure meds used treat three conditions enter ketogenic diet ketogenic diets severely carbohydrate restricted diets result ketone bodies made fat used brain fuel lieu glucose ketone bodies acetoacetate beta hydroxybutyrate acidic simply means extra protons hanging compared non ketotic brain well protons pumped neurons exchange sodium acting little bit like lithium extra protons outside cell sorts interesting things reduce excitability neurons reduce activity excitatory neurotransmitters protons seem block calcium channels nmda receptors example gaba inhibitory neurotransmitter anti seizure also increased brain ketogenic diets along many neurotransmitter changes sounds good well intrepid doctors israel bipolar patient respond well medication discussion patient family decided try ketogenic diet patient fasted hours began described classic ketogenic diet two weeks oddly urinary ketones two weeks doctors added mct oil coconut maybe specify low carbers also know induce reliable ketogenic state patient pretty gung ho diet doctors made note compliance good month diet tried showed clinical improvement loss weight urinary ketosis changes liver function seems odd would get ketosis fasting strict ketogenic diet perhaps work i discuss second case internet one find number anecdotes people improving bipolar symptoms ketogenic low carb diets i mentioned yesterday absolutely systematic scientific studies last thing would want ditch meds try home made ketogenic diet without anyone help ketogenic diets pretty bad side effects constipation menstrual irregularities elevated serum cholesterol care triglycerides good hemolytic anemia elevated liver enzymes kidney stones gall stones kids ketogenic diet get changes heart conduction puts higher risk death thought mediated via selenium deficiency valproic acid ketogenic diet seemed worsen side effects ketogenic diet studies done height low fat era likely designed pretty lipophobic nutritionists like atkins many original ketogenic diets regard omega omega ratio case atkins made manic psychosis lot worse i wonder arachadonic acid omega metabolite administration also shown worsen psychosis case patient valproic acid also may part problem natural sort ketogenic diet think inuit would probably lot fewer complications side effects makes think many ancestors probably spent many winter ketosis times lack food long fasts would brought brief periods ketone body use brain maybe brains work better spend time ketosis speculation course unimportant question research
