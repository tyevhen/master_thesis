common rhetoric used psychiatrists drugs psychiatrists prescribe somehow dangerous drugs numerous problems argument including fact psychiatrists really influence medications approved regulators majority called psychotropic medications prescribed primary care physicians associated arguments overprescribed ineffective i address another time evidence dangerousness i previously commented issue whether medications used field cause person become homicidal i restrict post issue medication complications whether regulatory action needs taken medication areas pharmacovigilance pharmacoepidemiology offer insights area drug dangerousness point good studies available public access formats one study done wales showed year period incident reports related medications patient safety incidents incidents resulted severe harm death patients medication related incidents majority reports skewed toward reports hospitals opposed primary care clinics looking severe fatal outcomes drug class table drugs could classified medications used treat mental illness benzodiazepines antipsychotics ranked th th respectively top drugs starting number one opioids antibiotics warfarin

critical denominator determine true complication rate unknown unfortunately complete systems pharmacovigilance long standing data base around decades used primarily monitor physicians prescribing practices pharmaceutical companies pharmaceutical representatives would detail physicians introduce product information company would sell information whether detailing resulted increased prescriptions product occasionally data large data base makes medical literature serious question well marketing information works pharmacovigilance publicly available data centers disease control cdc

nefazodone due low incidence hepatotoxicity serious outcomes like liver failure need transplantation conclusion article majority drug discontinuations due commercial reasons safety noted trend decreasing nmes time associated decrease drug discontinuations part problem perception drug dangerousness especially medications used psychiatric indications seems idea devoid side effects certainly ideal scenario approach taken regulatory bodies like fda like regulatory body depends politicians funding always variety political influences cases bureaucratic structure may prioritized scientific review paper qureshi et al good example certain threshold severe side effects may lead drug discontinuations reasons inspection current approved medications rare serious side effects shows plenty concerns commonly prescribed drugs classes regulatory concern many medications useful people really need medication applied population people likelihood rare serious side effects reason call drug dangerous especially people benefit taking also likelihood common side effects less dangerous adversely impact quality life also easy see problem politically words kind conspiracy driving prescription medications opposed others reality patient decision make i pointed i really never encountered person including myself patient takes decision lightly additional interpersonal psychological factors personal bias physician primary goal treatment minimal side effects tolerating side effects decision made patient informed physician always needs balanced therapeutic effect medication george dawson
