gets active anxiety symptoms impulse driven behavior happen receptors receptor theory several theories exist drugs actually brain body attaching cells called receptors interacting cellular enzyme systems affecting chemical properties outer cell membranes goldenberg pages many drugs believed combine chemical groups within cell cell wall drugs combine specific agents known receptors theory receptors actually attract drug molecular shape fits drug sometimes known lock key theory think shape key fit certain lock correct shaped key lock matched lock opened receptor theory much certain
