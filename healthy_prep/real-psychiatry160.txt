consciousness expanding treat anxiety depression actively discriminated like illegal drugs reason done research prove treat many problems back would said man restricting access valuable consciousness expanding drugs man overthrown world would much better place i briefly reviewed lines rhetoric occur cannabis i heard similar arguments ketamine probably fewer people experience difficult drug use even medical setting drug known concentration purity hallucinogens diverse set compounds number analogues parent compounds basic structure dsm little terms organizing category saying might make sense classify dissociative hallucinogens like pcp ketamine separate category traditional hallucinogens like lsd dsm little attempt classify wide array hallucinogens available point time authors use term serotonergic classic psychedelics lsd dmt psilocybin see graph i think makes sense classify drug taken express purpose creating hallucinations hallucinogen drugs secondary hallucinatory effects like alcohol cannabis stimulants remain unique categories cause hallucinations generally taken purpose scientific classification approaches generally based chemical structure available standard addiction

lasting side effects example could corroborate least people taken hallucinogens persistent problems anxiety panic attacks perceptual disturbances familiar themes new research lsd noted several additional references starter i read articles came several unanswered questions obvious technical sense obvious rather get detailed critique papers i thought i would outline i see missing claims made benign side effects profiles efficacy drugs look details subsequent posts efficacy drugs broadest sense used treat specific collection symptoms syndromes popular indication use changed little since mystical experiences curiosity introspection level medical indication use used produce altered state consciousness like alcohol recreational drug level issue resembles many ways medical cannabis exception cannabis seems preliminary evidence might useful medical problems data exists hallucinogens psychedelics lack effort recent meta analysis discussed nature suggests alcoholics treated lsd likely stay abstinent original experiments done found correlation recent paper lancet psychiatry discusses application existential anxiety terminally ill facilitate psychotherapy far medical indications seem bit stretch using cannabis prototype seems many parallel arguments made hallucinogens rhetorical standpoint interesting common antipsychiatry criticism psychiatry medicalized life order proliferate diagnoses make money pharmaceutical companies nobody seems problems cannabis hallucinogen proponents medicalizing life order provide useful venue cannabis hallucinogens adjunct psychotherapy new recent review psilocybin mdma assistive modalities psychotherapy read review authors proponents therapies cite lack useful current therapies reason exploring therapeutic aspects psychedelics may true extent usefulness current therapies also depends broad access i new assessment i get global acceptance therapy popular press suggest impression i get psychotherapy experience people get suboptimal best therapeutic modality often technique therapist economic considerations managed care constraints lack results authors suggest exploring psychedelics settings might offer better results faster results i ca help think therapy real life resemble psychotherapy clinical trials like many people managed care settings get two three cursory sessions discharged better happens psychedelic assisted psychotherapy occurs manged care setting guess complex therapy eliminated sessions drug administered emphasized conditions therapy reviewed include cancer anxiety addiction alcohol tobacco cocaine obsessive compulsive disorder psilocybin ptsd anxiety life threatening situations social anxiety autistic adults mdma minimal detail psychotherapeutic technique apart lengthy sessions problems blinding controlled trials discussed issue lower dose psychedelics active placebo work preliminary successes speculation effect psychedelics might discussed main argument seems ample reason continue research psychedelics measured clinical trials psychiatry lack objective measurements illness improvement case psychedelics standard problems still standard rating scales anxiety depression used trials additional instruments altered states consciousness questionnaire asq psychotomimetic states inventory psi seems interest purportedly consciousness expanding drugs may finally get psychiatrists interested consciousness dynamic multidimensional entity independent syndrome definitions problem course states highly subjective resistant classification also highlights question psychedelic drug psychotherapy supposed target typical syndrome anxiety depression purpose like altering conscious state fundamental way true really idea measured translated therapy i would also suggest outside purview physicians psychiatrists effective one aspect psychedelic assisted therapy i thought would useful patient takes two three doses drug course psychotherapy require maintenance treatment quality subjective measurement aside nothing annoying me interested reader reading rating scale questionnaire readily available i need know specific questions instruments statistics instrument secondary consideration far i tell neither asq psi readily available readable form i would go far encourage editors suggest original analysis rating scales questionnaires inventories include scale used direct wording rated data included article essentially worthless clinician talks patients measuring dimensions consciousness i addressed general lack concern human consciousness psychiatry medicine general human consciousness generally regarded brain determined state idea state arises underlying neurobiology plenty theories scientific society dedicated study human consciousness consciousness highly subjective state makes difficult study even basic consideration experiencing color red complex considering human every human unique conscious state experience color red unique way may able agree basic task requires selecting color red colors beyond never completely sure people experience colors physical properties complicated states like pain depression aging opposite gender true human consciousness would expect happen taking drug alters conscious state research purposes alter conscious state really good way measure baseline conscious state detect changes

adopted political strategy involved selling medical treatment rather recreational drug preferred path seems starting terminal illnesses illnesses current good treatments nobody ever seems explore question legalization question seem carry argument merit arguments therapeutic use hallucinogens seems following pathway rights politics pro hallucinogen literature promotes use hallucinogens including legal right people use hallucinogens i problem activists trying influence favorite politicians way easily obtain favorite intoxicant i problem activists start write medical literature perspective i also think additional level disclosure needed editorial level authors argue availability hallucinogens matter recreational intoxicant disclose potential conflict interest specific compounds example would dr smith supports widespread availability lsd medical recreational use explicitly stating potential conflict interest every bit important stating research supported pharmaceutical company difficult track better way live always philosophical ethical considerations i hope show future post philosophers generally interested telling people live although notable exceptions psychiatrists certainly interested either matter much rhetoric saying otherwise arguments use try hallucinogens general form may improve way offer valuable insights certainly may case many leave negative residual memory personal experiment residual symptoms much rhetoric old legalization argument really harmless i freedom use add corollary less dangerous tobacco alcohol full scale legalization argument hands debate become stereotypical days nobody seems ever ask question reasonable way live people get high really take drug expand consciousness something else focusing legal
