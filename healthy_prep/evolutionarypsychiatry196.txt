design would randomize one group teenagers high risk psychosis smoking pot hey make multi arm smoke lots pot others less another group smoke pot follow young adulthood see happens yeah going happen evidence several epidemiologic studies prospective cohort trials pot earlier teenager starts smoking pot higher risk developing psychosis also plausible biologic mechanisms study example seems show folks cannabis dependence folks schizophrenia similar brain metabolism key areas significantly different non schizophrenic non cannabis dependent folks animal studies randomized controlled trials done heavy doses thc seemed damage brain i feel like music austin spoon evah right click open new tab news bad funny cigarettes time one badmouths marijuana questions benefits one find bunch people pop sorts miraculous properties cannabis truth cannabis thc exceedingly interesting plant sorts intriguing cannabinoids commenter erik noted cannabidiol seems neuroprotective balance toxic effects thc suggesting vintage pot better ratio two might much healthier i used cannabinoids clinically never psychiatry however fda approved synthetic thc called marinol used give cancer ward medical school texas cachectic patients appetite back proliferation ton antiretrovirals saw lot advanced aids patients also seemed benefit marinol increase appetite i must say i number consults hospitalized cancer patients massachusetts never saw marinol prescribed look link marinol find dea page describing purified synthetic thc much safer cannabis smoked au naturale dea points valid lord knows cannabis might buy friendly neighborhood dealer certainly case immunosuppressed cancer advanced aids patients smoked joints could easily adulterated natural fungi grow big nasty deadly fungus balls lung i saw case fungus ball medical school patient immunosuppresed hiv also happened smoke lot pot could sources course attendings assured me seen several times aids patients heavy pot users pleasant way go

neuroinflammation might protect brain toxic injury thc may also called cholinesterase inhibitor class drugs used treat alzheimer small open label trials showed marinol synthetic thc reduced agitation helped weight gain dementia patients another small trial cannabidiol showed helped sleep peter known say small third rate studies small third rate studies little give reason design larger better studies might prove point two great thing cochrane review scientists comb medline ovid conference reports ongoing research trials pubmed awesome studies randomized controlled done acceptable follow inclusion criteria comb literature sort study respect cannabis products dementia find one study even greatest studies patients using marinol reviewers ultimately say reliable evidence cannabis used clinically dementia patients non dementia non psychosis studies neuroimaging studies example i treat particular population one apt anxious depressed demented psychotic none high risk psychosis ie family members psychotic disorders personal history like spend days smoking mom basement couch risky brain well neuroimaging review seems indicate metabolic changes brain related smoking pot one sure means kinds studies neuropsychologic testing also show mixed results seems consensus one reads general articles meant psychiatrists psychiatric times example marijuana brain perhaps best conceptualized potent nerve growth factor young growing brain teenager likely replete plenty nerve growth factor extra nerve growth factor potential disastrous lighter fluid briskly burning fire older demented brain smoldering dying fire nerve growth factor may well therapeutic enough good evidence conclude case marijuana paleo anthropologists answer question far better i healthy i name circumstances encompass majority patients reasonable evidence likely unhealthy risky i willing withhold judgment ultimate therapeutic value cases like dementia evidence certainly logically difference artisan variety vintage stuff skunk high thc brands today let forget underlying evolutionary principle human babies born natural eating natural living mothers fathers strong amazing broken automobiles left evolutionary diet activities likely thrive always cannabis potential potent long term brain altering substance old adage psychiatry fix ai broken modern world well let hope science researchers design implement good studies answer questions
