i finished reading paper called energy cost ssl deeply embedded systems sun microsystems researchers vipul gupta michael wurm fascinating stuff turns secure communication ssl shortens battery life approximately small mote like wireless devices use ssl size devices commonly used sensors manufacturing soon around believe sci fi hype makes extraordinarily sensitive anything draws electrical current including computation mote uncommon available energy pair alkaline batteries consumed ssl handshakes polling ssl data transfer remaining device ratios different non secure non ssl data transfer apples apples energy balance ssl mote pays energy penalty overall security authors paper discuss things like efficient versus inefficient implementations assembly language handshake algorithms elliptic curve obviously poor implementation could significantly affect performance unfriendly chip architecture could affect things authors mention particular chip used ti msp offers rotate instruction speeds sha md almost motes ubiquitous yet hopefully time powered something batteries ambient light worry ssl causing even zinc manganese enter environment worn mote batteries find way landfills imagine ssl environmental threat
