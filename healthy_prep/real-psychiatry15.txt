major study came lancet last week head head comparison suboxone buprenorphine naloxone bup nx vivitrol extended release naltrexone xr ntx i beginning product names actual medications used study nobody uses generic names point physicians important study couple reasons first oral naltrexone tablets already tried treatment opioid use disorder oud approach failed xr ntx used study long acting intramuscular injection given every days second many people oud want take bup nx many reasons may philosophically opposed may experience know relapse using heroin covering heroin withdrawal bup nx may able tolerate medication either side effects possibility cognitive side effects cognitive set patient also important decision common find patients benefit xr ntx using medication makes heroin ineffective therefore using waste money study design relatively straightforward week open label randomized trial comparing bup nx xr ntx placebo arm i hope point human subjects committees suggesting oud dangerous considering placebo group protocols starting treatment either medication make blinding impossible eight study sites national drug abuse clinical trials network ctn used one non uniform aspects trial detox protocols varied site two sites used opioids used clonidine comfort meds term i really like see comfort meds typically include nsaid like naproxen muscle joint pain hydroxyzine anxiety insomnia methocarbamol muscle spasm dicyclomine abdominal cramping four sites used day methadone tapers two sites used day buprenorphine tapers subject going xr ntx group opioids three days negative toxicology presence opioids negative naloxone challenge test authors explicitly state detox protocols favor bup nx induction phase initial dosing toward maintenance basically moderate heavy users heroin experiencing withdrawal symptoms end protocols random assignment subjects xr ntx group subjects bup nx group occurred early termination occurred number reasons xr ntx group bup nx group total subjects respectively assigned final intent treat analysis primary outcome variable time relapse relapse defined self report use either provided positive urine toxicology non study opioid failed provide urine sample subjects seen weekly monitoring cravings self reported use reports adverse events report substance use standard physician nurse led office based medication management described happening visits clear me described standard medication focused visit psychosocial counseling recommended available variable research secondary outcome variables included portion subjects getting induction phase active study adverse events including overdoses frequency non opioid study use opioid cravings rated visual analogue scale terms results broken across several variables intent treat analysis showed relapse free survival weeks xr ntx group weeks bup nx group weeks xr ntx group weeks bup nx group protocol group rather treatment intent used difference results due induction starting either medication end detox failures xr ntx group rates successful xr ntx induction varied site extended stay opioid free program methadone detox programs self reported opioid abstinent parallels results graphical representations data survival curves show essentially parallel curves initial drop due differences induction protocol authors conclude drugs equally safe effective preventing opioid relapse separate interesting survival curve rating opioid cravings time authors interpretation curves bup ntx group fewer cravings initially weeks ratings converged may additional data graph showing low point cravings reached weeks earlier bup nx group therefore persistent longer important secondary outcome measure number overdose deaths analyzed protocol overdose events xr ntx group overdose events bup nx group including failed induction subjects intent treat analysis increases number respectively fatal overdoses xr ntx group fatal overdoses bup nx group fatal overdose group due failed induction premature termination treatment physician involved treatment oud implications bup nx xr ntx equivalent treatments recognized press xr ntx evidence based treatment despite fact use time articles either ignore fact fda approved indication ridicule study used get approval additional evidence need standardized opioid detox protocols optimized patient safety efficacy treating withdrawal symptoms three options used treatment center trials representative available community one goals detox optimize transition medication assisted treatment mat prevent relapse opioid use authors point lack smooth transition xr ntx main reason treatment failures poorer outcomes group intent treat analysis besides detoxification protocol resources facilitate transition detox mat maintenance unknown clear transitioning patient detox mat critical step treatment process involves medication structure program individual patient support time people leave treatment sustained untreated withdrawal symptoms include severe psychiatric comorbidity including severe anxiety panic attacks insomnia often involves days sleep drenching night sweats depression often lot confusion symptoms due associated psychiatric disorder symptoms due withdrawal confusion heightened patient comes treated anxiety insomnia depression maintenance medication current paper describe optimal path treating patient characteristics psychiatric disorders substance use disorders exclusion criteria optimal patient selection bup nx versus xr ntx unknown additional significant psychiatric symptoms number factors influence patient selection least cost logistics many parts country still extremely difficult find bup nx provider even physician found many accept insurance pocket cost patients visits associated lab tests prohibitive xr ntx expensive injection may covered insurance companies patient assistance programs study may increase likelihood coverage despite fact xr ntx fda approved indication prevention relapse opioid dependence following opioid detoxification since clinicians use information discuss realistic treatment patients i previously pointed bup nx panacea neither xr ntx contrary idea antagonist therapy prevents overdoses significant differences overdose deaths study lead serious informed consent based discussion medications patients idea long medication taken whether taken indefinitely part initial discussion focus needs completing detox transitioning onto one medications patient capacity make realistic decision preferences regard medications part process life randomized clinical trial part skill set physician ability discussions takes ability prescribe medications take head head comparison vivitrol xr ntx suboxone bup nx even effective treatments prevent relapse opioid use many elements need place practical issue frequently discussed availability prescribers nobody seems talking fact treatment programs offer neither option also little discussion fact treatment programs lack atmosphere expertise provide patients shot successful getting opioids come long way agents treat oud compared days i would see hospitalized heroin addicts wanted stop realistic options i could offer days methadone detox continuing methadone maintenance dose covering sympathetic symptoms withdrawal clonidine i could tell closest methadone maintenance program assure appointment place program federal law time prohibited active treatment oud unless happened licensed methadone maintenance program legal regulatory landscape improved treatment programs everywhere get
