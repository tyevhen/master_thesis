interviewing seminars big part first year psychiatric training i sure goes days i recall record interviews critiqued instructor peers seminars i remember always agreeing critiques every psychiatrist goes develop interview style around basics every interview unique also depends person talking flow information interview always fascinating me times cover essential elements minutes time talk minutes end information facilitating directing flow information one key elements interviewing backdrop i found commentary interview robert downey jr somewhat interesting seems surprisingly linear reminded me media interview experiences predominate advice seemed dead air either i talking talking me got clip widely broadcast past several days interview takes bad turn downey politely gets walks discussion near end brief clip suggests probably minutes left critique interview kathleen kelley reardon focuses described human chemistry participants potentially involves features like attractiveness mood timing features reardon speculates downey may interview transition personal questions may premature sees excellent case study go wrong interviews i think good examples might go wrong also unknowns vantage point psychiatrist i observations i never worry tone interview i never working interview infomercial introduction important may missed even though supposed entire interview begins downey speaking old oral boards style point introduce set context interview come back try next year failed exam year interviewer could saved lot problems discussing interview context ahead time setting ground rules actor willing discuss time discover minute interview many people room never good thing i teacher i still people observing interviews teaching purposes i never like i completely focused person affecting me i see downey distracted disinterested i saw look advisor several times got point overtly looking advice i saw make clear announcement one point promoting movie clearly dissatisfied direction things headed comment directed people room best way maintain focus make sure two people room purpose interview focus point interviewer needs aware psychiatric medical interview overriding agenda mutual focus problem needs solved patient everything confidential possible i heard prominent psychiatrist researcher say psychotherapy conference primary goals nice patient say something useful celebrity interview really dual agendas publicity interviewee interviewer celebrity interviewer lead celebrity status interviewer probably aware want come across viewers want along famously provocative famously uncontroversial spectrum aspire celebrity interviewer focused entertainment versus journalism i personally think greater intrusion interview process contrary author point i think reporter krishnan guru murthy problem transitioning failing read cues downey seemed anxious me downey came across authoritative talking american cultural influences somewhat oppositional defensive talking past opinion gave embarrassing period life aggressive commenting interviewer motor behavior suggesting running time ask probably going controversial question would entirely different interview focus maintained superhero culture actors theories film fits genre pretty good interpretation stan lee origins vietnam era america time line developments implications film would filled time sometimes person interviewed drops gift feet go example i interviewing person incarcerated i rarely go directly information i probably get historical details elsewhere threat interview process i want interviewee develop cop transference start experience police interrogation i usually hour compared less minutes session interviewer needs aware fact psychoanalysis barbara walters interviews key emotional disclosure occurred hours interviewing heavy editing case downey talks portrays character interpretation character changed time leaves talking small part audience interview people interested art acting would ended lot better i watched interview i question whether journalistic biases operating becomes clear guru murthy wants downey answer questions nothing movie difficult time actor career clear reporter anxiety level building tries force questions clear trying force smallest possible window interview final minutes anxiety provoking me watch section interview often lot focus process aspects interview seems emphasis communication aspects interview linear pick cue make intervention interviews least way i see non linear lot parallel processes going interviewers tend elicit much different information based biases techniques may times i slow interview way get specifics times i looking global markers whether present based past experience i also wonder gotcha dynamic operative i called media interviews reporter preconceived notion world works good example fallacy christmas holiday season peak time year suicides i spent time explaining reporter phone really true interview i pummeled comments anecdotes people naturally get depressed kill often christmas happened me good reason avoid reporters way interview ended seemed quite civil me surprising me media making big deal spite fact really catastrophic interview endings tend occur people accusatory demanding threatening aggressive interview actor likely happen despite focus interviewing psychiatry seem loathe look science past years operating illusion order make dsm diagnosis takes getting answers right questions questions typically structured interviews using dsm precursor rdc criteria gave way diagnostic interview schedule dis early epidemiological work followed schedule affective disorders schizophrenia sads work seems led brief diagnostic checklists based dsm criteria i read article journal clinical psychiatry suggested clinicians clinic used sads diagnostic interview would better outcomes idea structured interview checklist elicits better useful information experienced psychiatrist interviewing patient another great fallacy field i would actually put top list rate higher needing head head comparison antipsychotics based time discontinuation whatever cochrane collaboration say limitations methodology need study practically drug trial evidence i right replicated tens thousands times every day psychiatrists work interview patient twice unlikely give history i standard flashcard lists medications classes consistently endorse medications list interview people subjective experience experience always plastic much interesting storing encyclopedia computer chips cases might put metric like test retest reliability interview metric global result structured interview given measuring something reflects functioning highly plastic organ i know would expect reliability high brings me back interview interview technology holdover evolved subtle modifications years currently constrained small fraction conscious state know optimize flow relevant information major limitation theorists looked mapping diagrams interview process none gained widespread acceptance good news psychiatrists operating level reporters george dawson md dfapa
