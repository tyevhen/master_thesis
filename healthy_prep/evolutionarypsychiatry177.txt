flurry rather interesting style evolutionary psychiatry papers week tomorrow i hope i review findings probiotics gut microbiota brain function rodents alas also paper jamie sent me breakfast staple types correlated gray matter cognitive function healthy children two breakfast choices forced rely correlative data feed children bread rice playing safe interested protecting growing brains guess jamie might blog one first actually knows today though i looking paper endocannabinoid signal gut controls dietary fat intake published pnas first i added two new blogs like minds listing right chris kresser healthy skeptic anastasia primalmeded i meaning add chris time never really got around terrific thoughtful anastasia mom medical student australia i find relatively new blog nonsense refreshing endocannabinoid paper well seen yet i covered endocannabinoids previously omega mice receptors funny cigarettes endocannabinoids cough focus obesity regulation summary endocannabinoids obesity background rat studies i far familiar binge eating literature obesity literature bingeing literature i aware done omega fats usually crisco though trans fat free crisco used recent studies grains sugar consistent findings rats binge sugar fat omega combination sugar fat resulted weight gain otherwise bingeing rats make extra calories spontaneously restricting times one study showed bingeing rats maintained weight increased fat mass bingeing crisco i think i recheck one i check edit later i misremembering major distinction literature comparing rats humans humans typically binge fat alone far likely binge pasta bread sweet foods chocolate salty snacks bingeing literature may focus may important overall state obesity straight obesity literature respect munchies endocannabinoids i think fair backdrop alrighty new paper researchers gave rats sham feedings okay three guesses used fat pasture butter coconut oil lard wrong corn oil mixed nutritionally complete diet sugar solutions protein solutions sham feed rat well unpleasantly install aluminum cannula stomach let liquid food drain allow rats eat liquid diet aforementioned macronutrients mmmm spoonful corn oil delicious researchers think eating fat mammals adaptive advantage seeking fat rich foods nutritionally essential scarce natural habitats innate preference become maladaptive limited environmental constraints indeed unrestricted availability fatty foods characterizes diets industrial societies considered key contributing factor obesity diabetes cardiovascular disease little review endocannabinoids happy little family omega derived bioactive molecules bind cannabis receptors cb cb receptors also activated cannabis two best studied endocannabinoids ag anandamide researchers study trying elucidate mechanisms endocannabinoid feedback goes mouth gut brain found previously cb receptors tongue modulate neural activity elicited sweet taste neural signals nutrients including fats sugars transmitted mouth brain via cranial nerves specifically v vii ix twelve pairs cranial nerves shoot directly brain rather shuffled spinal cord first predictably control stuff head neck one cranial nerves vagus takes long trip gut seems responsible lot brain regulation gut digestive system carries feedback two areas happened sham feeding sugar solution protein solution corn oil mixed liquid diet brain nerve activity rats levels endocannabinoids ag anadamide increased jejunum middle part small intestine rats fed corn oil mixed liquid diet rats fed protein sugar solutions none solutions changed jejunal content oleoethanolamide fat derived molecule typically signals satiety usually released small intestine response ingestion fat interestingly severing vagus nerve rats stopped production endocannabinoids rats sham fed corn oil would suggest feedback brain required produce endocannabinoids small intestine response corn oil signal small intestine researchers complicated work studying different entities along metabolic pathways endocannabinoids figure exactly endocannabinoid levels increased sham feeding corn oil affect generation ag seem slow natural breakdown ag typically done via hydrolysis biochem nerds anandamide popular endocannabinoid sham fat feeding increased production decreased breakdown another twist study researchers measured amount corn oil regular chow rats consumed infused rimonabant cannabis receptor inverse agonist simplistic terms blocks ability endocannabinoids activate cannabis receptors jejunum rats ate much less corn oil guts full rimonabant lesser extent less regular chow thus researchers conclude eating fat increases positive feedback mechanism causing increased ingestion foods especially fat via endocannabinoid signal gut brain along vagus nerve excited try gut specific cannabis receptor blockers would pesky anxiety insomnia depression side effects rimonabant active brain treatment obesity also known rats small intestine levels ag anandamide rise repsonse food deprivation fall upon refeeding suggesting may signal energy balance promote caloric intake last least discussion goes details reward area dopamine stimulation affected feeding rats fat rich foods i time chase papers right let guess fat used studies well take sure play safe eat spoonfuls corn oil especially rat elucidating pathways definitely interesting reason extrapolating sham feeding results whole real food eating humans please explain seems me finding normal small intestinal fat satiety feedback molecule oleoethanolamide elevated sham feeding corn oil mixed diets sugar protein suggests model incomplete best
