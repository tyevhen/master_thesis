comments depression leaky gut post tony mach mentioned interesting amino acid called acetylcysteine shorten nac put link wikipedia page describing wonders i heard nac course punishment savior people show er overdosed disgusting things overdose acetaminophen tylenol paracetamol decide whole bottle far far less alcohol even upper limits normal daily dose damage liver combined alcohol might feel sick immediately perhaps recover think nothing days later accumulated killing hepatocytes rotten liver make ill nothing short liver transplant save failing die rather horrible death livers vital substitutes bypass machines mechanical livers liver like dialysis machines apparently er visits year tylenol overdoses deaths well someone shows tylenol od er get level hours post ingestion plot level hours post ingestion handy graph dark line graph welcome world acetylcyteine disgusting compound typically administered fruit juice still makes people vomit give loading dose mg kg followed mg kg doses ca keep dose repeated time psychiatrist typically called er figure whether safe let person go serious suicide attempt need intervention surprisingly easy overdose tylenol accidently acetaminophen zillion counter medicines plus perscription painkillers percocet vicodin etc mg day upper limit safe without alcohol get acute liver failure little mg unlucky treatment simple magical possible fuliminant liver failure one side skipping hospital fine treatment everything body master antioxidant glutathione seems metabolite tylenol napqi kills liver cells like gangbusters glutathione bind render harmless run glutathione leftover napqi nasty job acetylcysteine nac comes ready precursor glutathione liver bountiful supply fight napqi well look wikipedia article nac treatment mucus build cystic fibrosis also acetaminophen overdose perhaps reduce kidney toxicity contrast dye though seem holding interstitial lung disease investigationally reduction noise induced hearing loss lessening destruction pancreatic beta cells curing hangover decreasing symptoms flu course i care specialist i required medical convention stick brain keep little nose parts body nac interesting properties noggin well usual goes back glutamate excitatory neurotransmitter doom short much glutamate around neurons rather like whipping horse go go go kill horses brains need time pasture chilling eating appropriate foods sometimes nice rubdown brushing well nac seems able get tricky areas brain amazing management glutamate past years number intriguing studies come using nac alone adjunct treatment difficult psychiatric conditions decent multicenter randomized controlled trials real deal tricky conditions trichotillomania compulsive hair pulling common exceptionally difficult treat several decades research come nothing effective nac trial schizophrenia bipolar depression another difficult disabling condition respond particularly well therapy medicine ongoing study ocd studies vary mg daily capsules i assuming better tolerated emergency room drink studies adverse events side effects placebo arm treatment arm many studies long months lifetime randomized controlled clinical trials studies positive effects pretty astounding considering pharmaceutical companies doubt spent millions millions chasing bipolar depression example without much show quetiapine fluoxetine olanzapine fluoxetine modest effects another cute little study used nac reduce cocaine cravings something really effective fda approved medical treatment would precursor master antioxidant anything glutamate brain mechanism sort hysterically complicated i quote trichotillomania paper fun nac hepatoprotective antioxidant converted cysteine substrate glutamate cysteine antiporter antiporter allows uptake cysteine causes reverse transport glutamate extracellular space stimulates inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors thereby reduces synaptic release glutamate restoration extracellular glutamate concentration nucleus accumbens seems block reinstitution compulsive behaviors translating sciencespeak nac helps excess toxic glutamate stop wrong place wrong time helps put brain pasture rest recovery downsides nac i think two problems might biggies first nac mucolytic thins mucus cutting disulfide bonds i suspect might raise risks one would want little mucus mucus important paul jaminet mentions issue links study also cutting disulfide bridges within body inflammatory baddie homocysteine supposed leading crispy collagen inelastic elastin arteries would possibly first show high blood pressure course hunter gatherer chugging grams nac daily evolutionary psychiatry seem potential replicate perhaps downsides natural brain glutamate situation lower stress life plenty appropriate minerals micronutrients hey maybe even absence tons carbs top inflammatory rodent diet ketosis live modern life brains already tracking wrong direction would certainly worth studying nac information view intractable otherwise untreatable conditions significantly impair functioning giving try
