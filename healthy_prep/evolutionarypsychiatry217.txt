i meaning eating disorders i find research frustrating eating disorder researchers see within eating disorders even areas diagnoses proscribed dsmiv really fit symptoms people three official categories anorexia nervosa restricting eating underweight obsessed body image bulimia nervosa bn bingeing purging via vomiting excessive exercise laxatives typically normal weight fluctuating weights body image issues eating disorder otherwise specified ednosanyone seems eating disorder quite meet criteria people eating disorders fall last category simply many people primary anorexia also binge purge way bulimics often periods restriction even worse entire category eating disorders official diagnosis binge eating disorders bed bingeing without restricting purging patients often overweight normal weight actually common anorexia numbers approximate many folks eating disorders seek treatment estimates adult western population bn bed estimates ednos review literature evidence based treatments really none ednos simply research focused bn anorexia firm things recommend severely underweight refeed supervision treatments work particularly well starvation extent reversed young people family therapy recommended bulimia particular type cognitive behavioral therapy specific disorder good evidence base eating disorders among deadly psychiatric disorders short term anorexia probably fatal cases though number dropping acute treatment getting better whereas bn ednos mortality rate people disorders including bed higher risk suicide good news year follow people disorders longer symptoms particularly frustrating eating disorder literature one real clue backed solid evidence causes genetic links common psychologic features environmental risk factors likely people low amounts serotonin dopamine certain areas brain vulnerable developing eating disorders suspicion speculative sensible combination societal pressures thin modern industrial diet terrible track record putting fat lead common restricting behaviors basically makes everyone member little minnesota starvation experiment locked continuously restrict worry exercise begin obsess food anxiety depressive side effects quite sensibly cave evolutionary imperative eat regain weight etc etc particular subset people often young women perhaps face societal pressure develop extreme behaviors become eating disordered thus conjecture industrial food problem wholesome unprocessed food get rid excess sugar excess linoleic acid gluten grains large part solution stance actually unproven controversial many people eating disorders restrict varieties food recovery common practice teach people eat everything moderation though focusing healthy nourishing food course suggest restricting whole categories food without solid evidence base could seen feeding disorder issue everything moderation i think putting aside entire paleolithic nutritional paradigm neolithic agents disease causing obesity first place eating disorders addictive folks addiction actually eventually moderate intake addictive substance people better least complete abstinence obviously one completely abstain food suspect neolithic agents building addictive cycle neurochemically brain definitely speculation educated guess i would say would seem getting rid diet would obvious help situation stabilized natural realistic relationship food body diet adopted would make sense adopt moderation make life easier less food obsessed everyone different people get despondent idea anything limits treating eating disorders like every psychiatric condition requires common sense flexibility innovation let get back addiction angle minute i going spend time second post focusing neurobiology binge eating today i going drop eating disorders look new paper called neural correlates food addiction study actually food obesity general bottom line america adults obese obesity related disease second leading cause preventable death obesity treatments unsuccessful patients regaining lost weight within years food addictive drug use result release dopamine mesolimbic regions brain least animal studies one gets sense reward happiness eating obese versus lean individuals show greater activation addictive behavior centers brain anticipation receiving palatable foods obesity food researchers typically mean sugar fat salt still unproven conjecture massive excess linoleic acid fructose easy cheap availability fatty grain chips like sweetened grain desserts issue gorgeous bone marrow dressing salad delicious steak would also light reward areas brain part natural order things shut reward cycle bodies reach certain level fat stored hand interestingly one finds case obese individuals people addicted drugs obese people anticipate food intensely actual food comes less enjoyment general reward brain areas light less someone lean true drug addiction brain seems like anticipation much actual event study young human women average bmi selected women enrolled program developed help people maintain healthy weight long term basis history eating disorders head injury current smoking illicit drug use psychiatric diagnosis excluded participant measured weighed took tests assessing level food addiction research standard item yale food addiction scale test among young women normal distribution participants put mri baseline measurement fasting hours caffeine either women exposed pictures chocolate milkshake picture glass water seconds thereafter received one two deliveries half milliliter chocolate milkshake calorie free tasteless solution meant mimic saliva randomized women got picture water saliva milkshake picture saliva water picture milkshake etc time taste delivery made give researchers idea scan would look like without paired stimulus taste delivery occurred via sort tubing system within mri scanner kind neat trick results women lean obese high level food addiction scale test showed activation brain centers associated addiction reward anticipation milkshake picture less activation actual milkshake pretty solid human evidence certain people truly addicted chocolate milkshakes interesting tidbits study addiction scores associated bmi participants average age however high scores addiction scale test far likely periods binge eating emotional eating problematic eating attitudes researchers felt young age sample might mean lean women high food addiction score would increased risk obesity older obese adults tend higher food addiction ratings i suppose time tell main problem study researchers measure hunger participants though fasted amount time may hungrier others hungrier people greater food reward signals brain limitation i see selection first place rather selecting random young women college campus example chose enrolled healthy eating seminar well learn really highly palatable food addictive certain susceptible individuals usually things highly palatable somehow good i feeling environment without neolithic agents disease food reward system would work planned like sex reward exercise reward jack system weird chemicals excess anything ever experienced evolution like heroin tobacco ho hos people develop problem obesity researcher milkshake recipe scoops haagen dazs vanilla ice cream cups milk tbs hershey chocolate syrup personally i would recommend using variety artesian homemade reduced sugar chocolate ice cream whole milk without syrup also whipped cream chocolate shavings top
