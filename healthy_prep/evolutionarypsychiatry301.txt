quick review hypothalamus brains secretes crh hormone tells pituitary gland secrete acth travels blood adrenal glands sit top kidneys stimulated acth adrenal glands spit adrenaline cortisol pow ready fight run whatever need jacked stress hormones eventually cortisol tell hippocampus tell hypothalamus cool stop producing crh cycle shuts supposed work depression anxiety obesity cycle broken cortisol stays high brain adrenal glands try compensate downregulating receptors seem work least long term whack hormonal system elements hormonal system seem get whack time i introduced main characters far hpa axis supporting cast many fold regulates sleep appetite mood members familiar leptin orexin serotonin among others let discuss supporting cast depth starting anecdote hormonal system general cushing disease results adrenal glands produce much cortisol symptoms cushing disease weight gain sleep disruption hypertension insulin resistance depression even psychosis depressed mood often first sign illness removal adrenal tumor producing cortisol adding medications suppress function adrenal gland improve symptoms including depressed mood simply giving someone tons cortisol glucocorticoids cause symptoms removing excess cortisol resolve symptoms elevated crh found brains suicide victims cerebrospinal fluid living depressed people people major depressive disorder seem increased response increased acth cortisol production response crh stimulation dexamethasone suppression test compared people without major depression interestingly family members people major depression show similar increased hormonal activation depressed comfort food overeaters actually lower cerebrospinal crh levels suggesting comfort food somehow soothes savage hpa axis beast leads obesity successful antidepressant treatment seems resolve hormonal abnormalities humans ones easily tested brain abnormalities rats rats administration antidepressants seems regulate expression crh gene stressed rats rats hanging good old time right brains examined microscopically finding would suggest antidepressants ability directly affect hormonal axis decreasing response stress newer studies people different crh receptor gene types seem show differential response antidepressant treatment people work well others different crh receptor gene antidepressant wo work future envisioned big pharma big medicine show office symptoms major depressive disorder anxiety i send genetic testing results come back i able pick medicine regimen fit genetic profile eventually doctors would hardly needed expensive take depression quiz insurance company website show processing center genetic testing appropriate pill maybe i post industrial maybe i see goes gleeful industrious minds businesspeople health care heaven forbid eat well take enough vacation exercise guerrilla prevention campaign leptin perhaps familiar hormone regulates appetite general higher leptin appetite suppressed obese people usually high leptin however showing primary regulation mechanism broken development obesity leptin tends diurnal variation evening rise leptin normal obesity rise seem happen resulting night munching also leptin ability suppress cortisol production adrenal gland reason obesity suppression work well either rare leptin deficient individuals end obese tend obese anxious depressed administration leptin alone seems solve issues orexin brain chemical stimulates appetite nom nom also related sleep disorders famously narcolepsy depression orexin neurons seem less numerous perhaps one reason depressed individuals classically lost weight whereas land vegetable oil hcfs get depressed generally gain weight orexin seems activate catecholamines like norepinephrine dopamine internal cannabis system yeah chemicals make brains rather like major active ingredient marijuana munch munch serotonin seems tell orexin cool drugs activate system wide serotonin phentermine recently withdrawn meridia used appetite suppressants treat obesity discussion serotonin heart valves htp skeeves me post sure read comments drugs block serotonin cause weight gain ssris ostensibly increase amount serotonin hanging synapse used treat emotional eating often result weight loss yes antidepressants often cause weight gain well likely due antihistamine effect agents rather much direct serotonin effect though i go issue fully subsequent post interest last least il il inflammatory cytokine elevated obesity depression little bugger found abundance fat cells suggesting may metabolism il supposed low day depressed individuals levels especially high day even depressed individuals measurable deranged hpa axis issues yet il immune system activator inflammation common depression anxiety metabolic syndrome right nifty players similar things depression anxiety obesity conditions commonly found together skinny depressed person happy overweight person rather similar obese person without diabetes slender type ii diabetic review papers discuss generalities conditions tend explain differences complicated studies done genetics big genetics studies answers hand i finish today complicated get stressed protect hpa axis good food friends relaxation depression anxiety real obesity quite visible
