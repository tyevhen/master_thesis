i going go unusual direction today swerve normal focus psychiatry comment general direction medicine ways psychiatry drug heavy focus forefront medicine good way perhaps far outside specialty i make fool myself young giant cough syrup right click open new tab thoughts response culmination number recent news items medicine first end expert panel convened national heart lung blood institute recommended universal lipid screening children years age years age surface seems innocuous enough conventional medicine standpoint one considers cholesterol important marker health let ignore little bit fact low cholesterol along exceptionally high associated increased overall mortality study study study matter one basic tenets modern medicine consider point test one runs test one must prepared something information going anything run test first place i pleasantly surprised jama editorial earlier month concerning universal recommendations new nhlbi guidelines linked recommendations behavioral drug therapies behavioral therapies obvious increased exercise prudent diet cough surely recommending diet focused healthy whole foods avoiding processed foods everyone healthy activity also universal without much controversy get drug therapy dyslipidemia means statins kids jama editorial gets real note meta analysis primary prevention trials primary prevention refers people without prior cardiovascular disease less general population whereas secondary prevention refers drug treatment folks already heart attack stroke statin use associated reduction coronary events reduction total mortality let ignore fact relative risk rather absolute risk numbers later let ignore fact atherosclerosis begins childhood cholesterol levels track childhood adulthood reducing ldl cholesterol levels appears extend life people familial hypercholesterolemia even cardiologist would agree children dyslipidemia develop early heart disease treating children statins exposes unwarranted risk side effects drugs lower cholesterol fibrates sterols newer cetp inhibitors associated increased unchanged risk cardiovascular events suggesting lowering cholesterol numbers means end studies first cetp inhibitor torcetrapib crackerjack job lowering ldl raising hdl time whee showed modest increased hazard ratio scarily enough would detected cholesterol measures used rather overall mortality cardiovascular events initial studies jama authors go remark statins tested small numbers children hundred studies ranging weeks years brief periods time surrogate outcomes cholesterol measures assessed far trials lacked size duration demonstrate health benefits children long term harms unclear might detected surely uncertainly would enough give pediatricians pause say least one screens compulsion quickly results give statins children data would recommend whole foods avoiding processed garbage prudent exercise staples children matter course novel public health intervention children clearly lacks evaluation determine whether long term risk benefit profile may fact favorable harmful let move children women statin use also controversial new meta analysis published journal american college cardiology week meta analysis statin effects women versus men i imagine study used order pressure average cholesterol go medicine primary prevention heart disease meta analysis brings together data number different studies strives statin study done prove benefit women particularly primary prevention end authors find compilation data trials sex specific outcomes people women outcomes similar women men statistically significant benefit women well men similar magnitude primary secondary prevention cause mortality also lower statin therapy women men significant differences sexes well hallelujah last conclusion statin therapy used appropriate patients without regard sex course know devil details beautiful editorial edition journal american college cardiology controversy consensus statin use sex editorial says yes indeed finally surprise statin therapy similar benefit women men mean exactly means secondary prevention already heart attack example statins indeed impart benefit i willing extend benefit women well men come primary prevention statins people risk factors heart disease proven heart disease talking whole different kettle fish first studies identified doctors meta analysis met inclusion criteria meaning high quality enough included primary prevention trials funded pharmaceutical industry included sex specific data side effects adverse events one included trials jupiter remains controversial halted early short follow devil women considerably less likely die heart disease men thus primary prevention women need meet stringent requirement men numbers alone primary prevention heart disease lesser benefit women risks diabetes muscle problems cognitive deficits perhaps increase cancer would expected issue women smaller lean mass thus higher relative statin dose issue play children longer lifespans lower risk heart disease higher risk cancer men relative risk decrease heart disease say decrease relative risk decrease might promising absolute risk change unimportant get heart matter women without cvd lower annual mortality risk lower cvd risk men without cvd therefore absolute benefit statins typically less women men suggesting might appropriate women receive statins less frequently men setting primary prevention current meta analysis provides information sex specific relative risk benefit absolute benefit absolute risk cvd proportionate risk reduction associated statin therapy needed make informed clinical choices regard use statins primary prevention although latter might similar sexes former might quite different studies provided sex specific risk data simply evaluate risk statins primary prevention women adverse outcomes extremely clinically important giving medicines healthy people prevent disease wisdom editorial sex specific results cardiovascular prevention tirals provided relative absolute benefits adverse outcomes cost effectiveness know less uncertainty whether good gander also good goose medicine still art emphasis
