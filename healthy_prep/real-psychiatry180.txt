i saw erik van kuijk md phd present lecture macular degeneration minnesota academy medicine couple weeks ago international expert subject thoroughly reviewed epidemiology basic science current treatment disorder described risk factors including age years smoking doubles risk dietary factors antioxidants sun exposure suggested best barrier methods sun exposure included baseball caps wrap around sunglasses point lecture i brief episode free association remark thought sunglasses issue within minutes i thought sunglasses multiple roles society sunglasses projective test i recall college professor seemed eager tell anyone would listen men beards sunglasses something hide i could told introvert course i something hide really nothing beard sunglasses sunglasses special meaning psychiatric disorders tend magnify ordinary thoughts like sunglasses make me look like alien i might want look like alien psychiatric disorder thought eye contact facial expression depends lot eyes people realize want expose channel communication inpatient psychiatric units sunglasses usually forbidden rationales vary place place typically patients staff intimidated people wearing sunglasses i meeting one point one participants asked late arrival sunglasses freaking couple books look social meaning sunglasses terms social behavior fashion scope books discussed popular press largely terms people sunglasses may attractive medical literature surprisingly little say factors indirectly work facial symmetry attractive feature speculation cases sunglasses give appearance greater facial symmetry cyclist sunglasses prominent place cycling literature coaches typically advise eye protection number reasons best articulated one reduce fatigue training cycling tens hundreds miles per day places going cycling sun point without sunglasses reflexive squint eventually spreads facial neck shoulder back chest muscles would surprise me also results increased grip tension handlebars increase blood pressure muscle contraction leads increased fatigue decreased efficiency factors probably explain many professional cyclists shades best designed wraparounds market epidemiological studies also show total sun exposure risk factor macular degeneration skin cancer places certain occupations recreational pastimes higher risk sampling beach goers spain showed correlation subjects sustained

comorbidity precursor iatrogenic complication mental illness theorists suggested ros produced metabolic syndrome reason numerous complications another potential research area whether current medications prescribed psychiatrists increase likelihood cataracts macular degeneration directly affect phototoxic mechanisms occur eye i recall medical student emphasized eye exams psychiatric patients brief emphasis quetiapine initially marketed much evidence since days concerned stellate cataracts retinal hyperpigmentation caused phenothiazines institutionalized deterioration quality
