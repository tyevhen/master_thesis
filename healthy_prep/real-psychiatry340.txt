i posted opinion burnout interventions physicians another blog opinion mental health interventions address product toxic work environment increasingly toxic seems futile me author agreed me stated program designed help residents survive residencies nothing pointed i agree residents ca change structure work environment ca quit one advantage senior physicians additional rhetoric thread suggested definition toxic work environment based i posted i thought would fairly easy pull together elements definition i proceed qualifiers senior clinician possible like areas life younger colleagues experience therefore relate posting case would whether worked trained managed care environments i think entirely possible worked trained exclusively managed care environment experience entirely different could make difficult identify cause distress might make easier tolerate non medical intrusions daily work environment documented personality factors cognitive styles like perfectionism obsessiveness implicated burnout tend traits inherent physicians i focused immediate environmental factors cause widespread problem really quite straightforward attributed mismanagement sleep deprivation adverse effects sleep deprivation cognition emotional health well documented expectation physicians sleep deprived well known tradition improvements restrictions residency training number hours continuous work current practices many ways led worsening problem hospitalist movement led days days schedule creates fatigue decreased work performance toward end stretch i interviewed hospitalists experience told me work slows largely due cognitive inefficiency last two days slowing adds additional hours added time complete work seems like questionable practice extend working hours point cognitive inefficiency fatigue sake administrative simplicity schedule cross coverage weekends outpatient physicians less immune expected sit clinics long hours complete essentially administrative tasks many administrative tasks unnecessary medical standpoint cases electronic health record ehr places large burden physicians everywhere access home create work environment excessive workload invention rvus given administrators unprecedented leverage establishing high volume low quality production line physician services markedly different quality service provided different physicians submitting billing code unquestionable race bottom administrative side better example annual review conversation physicians told global productivity scheme one two things happen told target higher decile two next year simply given rvu expectation need meet order justify salary cases arbitrary expectation percentage increase rvus theoretical upper limit changing work load accounting fact physicians taken work tasks past thirty years previously done people transcriptionists billing personnel replaced hundreds thousands burden generating detailed medical documents accurate billings falls directly onto physicians heavy price seeing patients day physicians generally settle documentation associated phone calls billing expectation physicians need know matching documentation purely subjective billing coding scheme change year year within organization reminder absurd administrative burden paid physicians uncertainty medicine demanding field mapped onto significant biological variability increases age patient coping uncertainty one baseline tasks physicians best way cope stay current best diagnostic treatment practices speciality practiced business government intrusions field based strictly cost regulatory changes introduce much uncertainty intrusions take form case managers external reviewers demanding ill people discharged hospitals based arbitrary length stay figure reviewers denying recommended therapy physician seen personally responsible patient denied medications based expense contracting treatment based guidelines promulgated business organizations rather medical professional organizations also broad movement train physicians basically customer service representatives use basic interpersonal techniques many organizations use customer feedback another piece algorithm determines compensation important physician task telling patient might want hear incentivized relevant dimension staff ordering physicians around frequently physicians real responsibility patient frequently working proprietary guidelines devised people also physicians direct responsibility patient expectation free work better example free work looking employees health care organizations physicians replaced stop teaching medical students residents another good example lectures lecture preparation reimbursed usually expectation number patients needs seen day made point week teaching tasks typically unsupported lecturers teachers responsible lecture content even getting necessary copyright permissions managed care medical education integral part work physicians typically got credit department support current work environment emphasizes rvu productivity sole measure reimbursement become problematic academic environments supposed emphasize teaching many cases academic goals become secondary called productivity managed care added immense amount additional free work physicians comes form additional work due utilization review medication prior authorizations blizzard additional paperwork case medication prior authorizations takes minimum minutes day additional staff paperwork i sure physicians spent kind time single case initial impetus measures supposed cost effectiveness apparent point making money managed care companies real priority physicians forced role rubber stamping measures rubber stamping comes significant time cost aggressively holding physicians productivity standard wasting significant amounts time probably single toxic factor already toxic environment overt abuse unprecedented leverage business administrators physicians proliferation administrators also additional strategies developed get rid physicians dissenters fit corporate expectations familiar one disruptive physician concept many forms corporate interest taking complaint physician whether substantiated using manipulate physician many possible sources evaluation solicits complaints coworkers environment physician works making complaints anonymous predictably results significant negative complaints may reviewed annual review used compensation purposes disciplinary action variations within organizations like three strikes rule procedures physicians involved recourse filing lawsuit defamation suit procedures become tools used administrator physician viewed dissenter latest greatest idea administrator i seen physicians subjected firing onerous rehabilitation schemes like meeting administrator supposedly aggrieved employee help get along ongoing basis exercises manipulation superimposed physician already trying keep head water sleep deprived assembly line environment covert war medical profession let face business administrators would obviously love physicians way treat like production workers rather knowledge workers would really like replace physicians less expensive providers prescribers eventually make argument corporate structure various computerized whistles bells superior trained medical staff reason tension point physicians skills learned medical school residency codified certain degree legal regulatory landscape reason behavior inconsistent corporate behavior tolerated particular physician probably skills nobody else prevent administrators threatening entire blocks physicians either disenfranchisement firing disenfranchisement occur along spectrum decreased reimbursement additional work expectations without additional resources additional sorties include campaign teach physicians basic interpersonal skills learned many times medical school residency bringing consultants tell physicians perform work manner consistent administrators want ignoring often considerable internal expertise department another familiar strategy legislative front exploited maximum already business tactics like utilization review prior authorization included many state statutes resulting business friendly legal regulatory environment leaves little room criticism physicians patients examples toxic work
