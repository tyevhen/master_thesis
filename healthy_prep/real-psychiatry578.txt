ronald pies md published second article two part series american psychiatry save essay contains specific recommendations change i surprised see written perspective american public disenchanted psychiatry profession needs address issues attributes public relations problem number factors including lack robustly effective well tolerated treatments ties pharmaceutical industry declining use psychotherapy public lack understanding current effective treatments essentially political attacks anti psychiatry groups sources disappointing see formulation problem basically one public relations dr pies observes public really care dsm model used mental illness historically obvious reason psychiatry tolerated years availability treat people obvious problems difficult deny mental illness exists brought catatonic family member emergency department able eat drink two days fact alone reason decades anti psychiatry abuse nuisance destroyed profession main problems days morphed brisk business many detractors whatever legitimate media seem able separate wheat chaff case psychiatry incredible amount chaff dr pies six fairly specific recommendations based public relations problem i listed table along responses places distinct advantage i position reacting statements i offer solutions along article hope rebuttal rebuttal anyone else reading article dr pies dr dawson change name dsm manual neurobehavioral disease mnd another option would manual psychiatric disorders i generally avoid term behavioral political term used managed care companies disenfranchise psychiatry behavioral neurologists suggest know human behavior psychiatrists every time use word behavioral rather psychiatry lose somebody neuropsychiatry anyone emphasize importance suffering incapacity hallmarks disease eliminate condition lacks features i think dsm confused cautionary statement definition mental disorder xxi describes mental disorders clinically significant behavioral psychological syndrome pattern occurs individual associated present distress disability significantly increased risk suffering death pain disability loss freedom additional details separating clinical descriptions disease research oriented criteria using prototypes clinical descriptions might useful public relations move experienced clinicians already movement dsm already capture namely elimination schizophrenia subtypes understand diagnostic categories tools service medical ethical goals i think experienced clinicians also currently biological data regarded supporting finding disease categories diagnoses would remain clinical probably state art biomarkers may fast approaching define homogeneous categories disease specific successful treatments offered parsimony regard number diagnostic categories agreed point able use mechanisms disease parse categories hopeful point speculative example would role ventral tegmental area addictions amotivational syndromes opinions i offered apparent i think plan fairly weak one order come strong plan major problem affecting psychiatrists delivery psychiatric services needs clear focus i look dr pies suggested solutions public relations diagnostic manual focus i suppose could argue public relations always important diagnostic manual essentially public relations nightmare particularly considering arguments people trained clinicians agendas looking easy press i think american psychiatric association resources engage thousands anti psychiatry special interest groups want make headlines critiquing dsm order save american psychiatry problem needs clearly recognized single destructive force american psychiatry without doubt managed care includes managed care companies profit managed care companies profit pharmaceutical benefit managers government agencies using managed care strategies ration psychiatric care within space two decades essentially shut half inpatient bed capacity turned inpatient units high volume low quality discharge mills created similar assembly line outpatient clinics added hours free work physicians frequently justify financial decisions claim one great purveyors quality treatment medicine united states travesty possibly ignored threats american psychiatry pale comparison become profession essentially defined managed care industry reverse trend actually save psychiatry following steps need taken managed care pharmaceutical benefit managers managed care tactics applied government government proxies need clearly identified problem needs concerted effort reverse political tactical gains made industry importantly reclaiming quality ground managed care industry currently represented ncqa role accreditation entity anyone looked standards mental health care appalled every professional organization psychiatrists members critiquing organization posting quality standards professional psychiatric organizations need maintain edge terms quality standard care guidelines afford guidelines years date need date current american psychiatric association task professional societies post current guidelines areas expertise possibly win political battles industry special interest group using dated incomplete guidelines standards care excellent example psychopharmacology guidelines available british association psychopharmacology website education future psychiatrists critical makes issue managed care assembly line psychiatry even immediate problem possibly expect psychiatrists train additional one two years going paid less see patient enough medication management visits world fund additional training professional salary unless concrete changes occur practice landscape future current psychiatric training risk point speculating enhanced event adequate funding available training future profession i would recommend changes total time residency psychotherapy training different manner suggested pies i would opt adding two year neuroscience rotation pool resources departments neurology neurosurgery joint rotation focus latest neuroscience applications psychiatry neurology neurosurgery near future genomics neuroscience required training associated philosophy taught time discussions modeling various levels terms psychotherapy first thing recognize progress made residency programs well documented archives article weissman al long ago number biological psychiatrists walking around annoying rest proclaiming i talk therapy psychiatrist trained psychotherapy applies continuously work uses inform structure treatment best psychiatrists i encountered psychotherapy little minutes patients saw time found discussions beneficial psychotherapy today also informed new england journal medicine article written kandel years ago described neuronal plasticity affected human encounters teaching psychotherapy today used technical tool teach patients heuristic tool teach staff residents human consciousness biological basis newer forms psychotherapy acceptance commitment therapy mentalizing therapy provide theories explicit roadmap provide research proven effective psychotherapy takes human consciousness account political attacks prominent government officials tolerated longer acceptable suggest psychiatrists corrupted psychiatrists paid give presentations drug companies research suggestion dsm corrupted ties pharmaceutical industry dealt clear strategies deal blanket claims congressional critics i never understand entire profession became criticized fact members legitimately paid work pharmaceutical industry i understand member congress decide investigate private employment arrangements employee employer say nothing problems found i understand member congress significant conflicts interest allowed treat profession impunity conflicts interest never discussed board certification become business rapidly aligning business running medical boards managed care corporations goal ongoing professional education bring practitioners standards reason board examinations necessary evidence achieve goal clearly arbitrary political decision american board medical specialties tolerated practitioners field precedent forming independent boards i would refer american society addiction medicine clear example abms longer relevant better solution would form new board meets needs clinicians instead purported political goals quality based standardization local practice attainable goal one practical problems medical specialty fact outliers robust solution best example i think wisconsin alzheimer institute dementia diagnostic clinic network network statewide collaboration independent clinics receive guidance updates central university based clinic specializing diagnosis treatment dementias patients anywhere state wisconsin physicians refer local clinic receive state art diagnostics treatment recommendations model solves two problems psychiatry first access state art psychiatric treatment second practice drift practitioners especially outliers also solves third problem ongoing education reason collaborative networks like one could established mood disorders addiction schizophrenia anxiety disorders personality disorders training levels could guided principle psychiatric residents need necessary skills get networks implement guidance suggested central academic center path i would take save american psychiatry easy path realistic one psychiatrist practicing past years realizes practice environment deteriorated rapidly despite talk shortage psychiatrists current lot psychiatrists worked death trapped paradigm results high volume low quality work main problem foreseeable professional organization carry apa political expertise leadership regard future look good i think also implies apa really underestimated far psychiatry fallen much played role fall i see occasional glimmer hope long ineffective structure election process rewards academic achievement rather vision psychiatry st century progress remain difficult impossible already replaced generation prescribers areas managed care government would complain occurred everywhere george dawson md ronald pies md american psychiatry save part psychiatric times
