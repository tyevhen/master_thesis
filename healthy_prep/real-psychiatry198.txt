minnesota made headlines least within state lately qualifying intractable pain typically known chronic noncancer pain condition minnesota medical cannabis program i find politically interesting want take medical systems care strategy eliminate word medical wherever possible case limited medical evidence treatment carries significant risks initiative seems like part political movement toward general legalization marijuana word medical added seemingly legitimize entire process i think anything medical marijuana cannabis want legalized make argument pretend compound appropriately compounds around years suddenly become miracle drug i previously posted original statute repeat post full details intractable pain indication listed separate dhs web site including definition intractable pain statutory definition intractable pain quite complicated seems misunderstand nature chronic pain ignore addiction cofounder address non cannabis treatment chronic pain schedule ii v drugs issue seems totally unrelated cannabis use cite couple examples subdivision definition purposes section intractable pain means pain state cause pain removed otherwise treated consent patient generally accepted course medical practice relief cure cause pain possible none found reasonable efforts reasonable efforts relieving curing cause pain may determined basis limited following treating nonterminally ill patient intractable pain evaluation attending physician one physicians specializing pain medicine treatment area system organ body perceived source pain chronic noncancer pain generally accepted medical treatment eliminate pain medication totally alleviate pain includes high potency opiate medications literature suggests whether high potency opiates anticonvulsants antidepressants used result moderate amount pain relief best additional measures like physical therapy psychotherapy needed produce optimal results really minimal evidence addition cannabis existing pain medications add anything case statute also suggests pain patients referred one physicians specializing pain medicine part body pain associated statute seems like could easily set physician group physicians could add cannabis medications already prescribing words statute providing non medical indication used alter medical practice large scale prescription addicting drug seen previous epidemics use overprescribing based similar theories subd statute gets existing medical practice reasons apparent me includes following introductory paragraph goes cite non applicability statute issue treating substance use disorders use non therapeutic purposes providing scheduled drug purpose terminating life person intractable pain using non approved drug based experience schedule ii v drugs widely used non therapeutic purposes use indication outside analgesia considered non therapeutic purpose examples include taking extra medication insomnia anxiety depression well mixing medication alcohol added effect seems little naive me think controlled substance broad effects conscious state potentially reinforces use used purposes includes use cannabis marijuana subd prescription administration controlled substances intractable pain notwithstanding provision chapter physician may prescribe administer controlled substance schedules ii v section individual course physician treatment individual diagnosed condition causing intractable pain physician shall subject disciplinary action board medical practice appropriately prescribing administering controlled substance schedules ii v section course treatment individual intractable pain provided physician keeps accurate records purpose use prescription disposal controlled substances writes accurate prescriptions prescribes medications conformance chapter science added intractable pain page form review entitled medical cannabis non cancer pain systematic review prepared standard manner current literature reviews critiquing quality studies looking evidence shows people uninterested details reviews could benefit reading executive summary like systematic reviews authors conclude overall evidence sketchy studies established response better placebo clinical trials short duration patient selection likely reflect might use drug minnesota trials looked adjunctive treatment cannabis limited forms rather cannabis monotherapy also conclude cannabinoids associated greater risk adverse events serious adverse events events associated withdrawal study placebo authors aware recent review jama provided interesting analysis data context review pages authors point review unlike jama review use data unpublished studies meta analysis treatment effects analysis jama review data generally shows either evidence show superiority placebo case evidence low insufficient strength i going include exhaustive review toxicity cannabis developmental concerns cannabis exposure utero developing adolescent brain i considering separate post topic purposes intractable pain post i add couple points politics regulation first point chronic pain complex disorder resembles commonly conceptualized psychiatric disorder much closer considered standard medical surgical disorder chronic pain multidimensional frequently associated depression anxiety insomnia pain ratings given day reflect state conditions cannabis affect conditions unpredictable ways best example i think chronic marijuana smoker starts order treat anxiety stops years later anxiety worse experiencing panic attacks paranoia anything complicates dimensions chronic pain acceptable overall treatment second point chronic pain patients end taking drug addictive manner independent pain relief true marijuana opioids benzodiazepines many patients openly admit using drug like effects thing pain final point people discriminate numbness analgesia drug take pain induce numb state one generally difficult time functioning i include points chronic pain trials additional phenomena usually examined clinical trials trial occurs every subject rate pain like take blood pressure reading loses lot important information process studies reviews listed cannabis non cancer pain show weak positive effects kinds studies eventually approved fda evidenced fda actions regulatory considerations trump scientific ones marijuana described fast growing billion dollar year business projected maximum market billion annually bet large commercial lobby pushing approval whatever products want bring market i plan getting riled minnesota experiment political indications medical marijuana clearly response current cultural swing view cannabis benign product use medical avenue get total legalization marijuana use gets widespread alcohol use population toxicity evident meantime i hope physicians get pulled politics especially psychiatrists i plan registering medical cannabis registry certifying patients political indications use i consider foolish endeavor would much easier take physicians loop instead pretend select patients drug medical indications anything widespread use marijuana cannabis whatever reason complicate psychiatric practice increase costs treatment already
