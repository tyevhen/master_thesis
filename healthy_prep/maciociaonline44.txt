starting discussion i would like clarify something regarding nature damp heat damp heat dampness predominant pathogenic factor dampness hot heat damp fact would better call hot dampness rather damp heat however i continue calling damp heat term common use means treatment damp heat must concentrate draining resolving dampness rather clearing heat however course use cold herbs clear heat i would like also point generally chinese books doctors overstate frequency damp heat always talk damp heat seldom dampness example china every urinary problem due damp heat whereas also see lot urinary problems dampness without heat lot urinary problems caused stagnation sinking similarly gall bladder problem always attributed gall bladder damp heat whereas west see lot patients gall bladder problems dampness much heat i discuss dampness context heat common pathogenic factor many different symptoms diseases aetiology dampness external dampness derive environmental climatic dampness thus may due humid weather whether hot cold also damp living conditions living damp houses exterior dampness also caught wearing wet clothes wading water working damp places sitting damp ground seasonal external damp heat predominant summer late summer specifically great heat period periods year white dew period i roughly two months autumn equinox prevailing place seasonal heavenly exterior factor prevailing place earthly exterior factor due prevailing conditions place i low lying damp place place prone fog damp living conditions house etc internal diet dampness may result excessive consumption greasy foods dairy foods sweets sugar cold raw foods damp heat may also arise excessive alcohol drinking together greasy fried foods dampness may also due overeating way retention food irregular eating habits work excessive physical work including sports exercises lifting gym etc weaken spleen lead dampness internal injury spleen weakness spleen deriving chronic illness constitutional constitutional weakness earth element predisposes patient spleen deficiency dampness hand constitutional tendency fullness earth example people constitutional tendency stomach heat may lead heat stomach spleen combines dampness characteristics dampness following characteristics dampness sticky difficult get rid heavy slows things infuses downwards causes repeated attacks lingering exterior dampness invades body tends invade lower part first typically legs legs flow upwards leg channels settle pelvic cavity organs settles female genital system causes vaginal discharges settles intestines cause loose stools settles bladder cause difficulty frequency burning urination however dampness also common head always cause sinusitis example clinical manifestations dampness extremely varied

fact dampness obstructs mechanism leading dampness heat also dries fluids condenses dampness furthermore heat part damp heat especially predominant may also injure yin pathological processes illustrated figure figure consequences damp heat characteristics damp heat i discussed characteristics dampness i describe characteristics damp heat seasonal character prevalent summer late summer even countries hot damp summer seasonal damp heat also exacerbates pre existing internal condition damp heat urinary problems gall bladder problems wei syndrome ms intestinal problems etc lingering long course disease damp heat lingering heat part damp heat also perpetuates problem heat condenses body fluids dampness gives rise phlegm damp heat easily gives rise phlegm phlegm heat heat damp heat condense body fluids phlegm manifests complex symptoms due combination dampness heat may give rise contradicting symptoms signs example patient may feel hot heat skin may cold touch may cold feet patient may feel cold general may also get hot easily may feeling heat pulse rapid vice versa may thirst heat desire drink dampness bowels may sometimes loose dampness sometimes dry heat damp heat may injure yin heat part damp heat predominant may injure yin leads even complex clinical manifestations patient obvious symptoms damp heat tongue coating damp heat frequently toxic toxic heat damp heat frequently gives rise toxic heat toxic heat characterized heat swelling pain often pus skin bacterial infection causing pustules example toxic heat damp heat easily damages stomach spleen course dampness also damages stomach spleen damp heat even dampness tends injure spleen heat tends injure yin stomach symptoms damp heat following summary symptoms damp heat please note symptoms low grade
