question thousands millions people end taking stimulants unnecessarily days addiction psychiatrists unique perspective i thinks goes beyond typical approach problem i like consider grounded behavioral pharmacology neuroscience sake essay i limit remarks adults college aged older taking stimulants neuroscientific discoveries area brain maturation suggest significant portion college aged individuals might make decisions make decade later practical consideration millions people college making decisions stimulants every day several ways look problem best approach i think look various ways patients present treatment request stimulant treatment subtle overt unlike papers current literature i think diagnostic questions subtle initial clinical assessment diagnosis treatment commonly overlap cases i illustrate treatment considerations become primary initial minutes interview general psychiatric interview always screen sorts recollection typically problem focused past time interview started incorporate disorders focus inquiry outpatient side disorders added primarily post traumatic stress disorder attention deficit hyperactivity disorder non geriatric populations time screening done whether uses symptoms checklist lengthy interview always chance missing true diagnosis adding diagnosis probably examples i depressed past ten years inquiry mood disorders point focus concentration impaired concentration attention span occurs number psychiatric disorders combined developmental history history chronicity easy see problem missed diagnosis adhd initiate treatment disorder addition primary mood disorder problems approach especially history mood disorder clear never adequately treated i diagnosis bipolar disorder manic medications working adhd adults rarely presents hyperactivity severe could mistaken mania manic episodes also phasic disturbances making unlikely would many patients single practice manic adhd cases happen stimulant treatment complicates treatment bipolar disorder lead worsening mania delusional thinking hallucinations son daughter adhd two variations interaction first parent told high heritability adhd advised also probably assessed mention primary care physician may need treatment second parent child adhd diagnosis reads diagnostic materials comes appointment says know i read symptoms think i i treated adhd i always problem reading i never good school common approach view adhd screening proceed treatment physicians general little training assessment treatment learning disorder although comorbid adhd learning disorders also significant population people pure learning disorders adhd i took friend adderall felt like i could concentrate study first time life i lot better test population wide bias stimulants specific treatment adhd rather drug temporarily improve anyone energy level attention span also cultural phenomenon cognitive enhancement using stimulants performance enhancing drugs may driving request known availability stimulants campuses professional schools widespread associated students selling prescriptions profit availability stimulants illegally obtained purpose cognitive enhancement issue confused position statements scientific journals support practice i seen studied would interesting see questions responses cognitive enhancement asked student health centers practices see lot college professional students i adhd need prescription refill may true patient clear cut documented diagnosis prior age dsm criteria happened since initial diagnosis childhood critical history continuous treatment since treatment disrupted common causes disruption include stimulant side effects symptom resolution age co occuring substance use problems detailed history course treatment since childhood needed make decision continue reinitiate treatment i heard test adhd question often initiates screening higher level number places extended neuropsychological batteries brain imaging tests eeg tests claim definitively diagnose adhd fact tests capability i heard one top experts world adhd make statement also neuropsychologist i several years experience quantitative eeg machines know limitations point several hours extended testing adds nothing detailed interview review collateral information symptom checklists basically assure questions asked meds need adjusted could question person treatment another problem person already treated adhd unstated issue underlying belief adjusting medication one mental processes closer perfection child psychiatrist i work said best goal treating adhd get functional perfect functioning i think unrealistic goal perfection drives lot prescriptions exceed recommended fda limits also explains lot rescue medications superimposed sustained release preparations like adderall anyone familiar pharmacokinetics sustained release drugs realize rescue medications like immediate release adderall top sustained release adderall xr unnecessary i ca stay sober i ca get treated adhd complicated confusing situation child psychiatry literature suggested initially children treated adhd less likely substance use disorders adults children untreated adhd evidence accumulates less clear many adult psychiatrists addiction psychiatrists extrapolated equivocal findings mean treating known new diagnosis adhd adult improve treatment outcomes adhd evidence true addiction psychiatrists believe opposite true cross addiction phenomenon treating person addiction makes difficult stay sober drug choice person addicted stimulant medication clear history accelerating dose stimulants using unorthodox ways intravenously smoking snorting etc unlikely person able take stimulant prescription controlled manner also possible person making request long history experiencing prescription street drugs necessary regulate mental functioning highly reinforcing even effects sustained hours less i sober one month ca focus remember anything subjective cognitive problems frequent initial sobriety substance used total amount used time probably determine extent cognitive changes persist difficult problem study reasons clinicians know cognitive effects standard approach problem experience i think two months sober absolute minimum time consider evaluating subjective cognitive problems even time getting collateral history person cognitive functional capacity problem solving work arounds would probably biggest part treatment scenarios exhaustive i probably could come another illustrative pathways questionable stimulant use common thread anyone scenarios endorse symptoms adhd figuring symptoms fairly obvious many checklists one checklists shows symptoms checkboxes necessary make diagnosis grayed panels easy fake symptoms interview diagnostic checklist takes lot hard work part physician figure might faking also symptoms diagnosis one features dsm attacked several critics pre release hysteria generic diagnostic criterion requiring distress disability establish disorder thresholds dsm p case adhd criterion clear evidence symptoms interfere reduce quality social academic occupational functioning dsm p diagnosis adhd generally diagnosis severe functional disorder psychiatrist practiced hospital setting people i assessed clearly met functional criteria time i saw diagnosed severe mood disorders psychotic disorders substance use disorders dementias many definition unable function outside hospital setting entirely different assessment faced successful professional worked high degree competence years presents one problems think adhd takes review diagnostic criteria takes exploration patient motivations treatment hope accomplish treatment also takes conservative prescribing bias part prescriber stimulants potent medications alter person state consciousness potentially addicting medications result craving wanting take medication irrespective therapeutic effect wide availability stimulants led first amphetamine epidemic united states i first started psychiatry i still seeing people became addicted stimulants widely prescribed weight loss well known medications ineffective weight loss people continued take high doses spite fact lost weight talking people drives many people feel like competent taking stimulants believe cognitive functional capacities improved despite fact minimal evidence occurring descriptions work family number strategies clinical practice avoid problems excessive stimulant prescriptions i address separate post main point post look ways people mild subjective cognitive concerns addictions people seeking cognitive enhancement people functioning well believe function better come treatment adhd get stimulant prescriptions george dawson md dfapa supplementary literature used construct hypothetical scenarios
