suicide rates selected oecd countries suicide important problem psychiatrists even though rare event seems like time focused preventing suicide many days many high risk patients patients chronic suicidal ideation seen clinics hospitals treated outpatient settings treated involuntary basis hospital settings since suicide diametrically opposed self preservation assumed rational person would want get help thoughts impulses like things psychiatric practice almost never simple psychiatrists encounter wide range reasons suicidal thinking times suicidal thinking obvious declared suicide attempt many people decide see psychiatrists first suicide attempt even point common find person disappointed succeed common find person greatly relieved survived even assure cooperation necessary prevent another attempt standard practice assessing suicidal thinking ideation potential risk risk factor analysis standard practice long i practiced past years analysis requires making diagnosis series diagnoses looking associated factors patient describes mental state time major psychiatric diagnoses like major depression schizophrenia bipolar disorder panic disorder borderline personality disorder chronic substance use disorders significant lifetime prevalences suicide varying psychological autopsies series suicides find nearly patients suicided studies significant psychiatric disorder also studies done social science perspective emphasize social risk factors suicide including sex martial relationship status economic factors loss suicide widely misunderstood problem sometimes even patients experiencing thoughts common example encounter people suicidal thinking say deterrent suicide guts associated worry might painful feel need explain carry irrational i take mean point time suicidal person conscious state changed longer rational person must explain away fact carry irrational another common observation speaks conscious state many people say i never understood person could suicidal i finally felt way suggests altered conscious state associated mood state depression many times mixture depression anger anxiety resulting agitated state led understanding suicidal thoughts final observation one stressful parts psychiatric practice i believe person tell me going kill much acute care psychiatry hinges ultimate question risk factor analysis essentially nullified patient emergency department diagnosis past suicide attempts known thing left go standard questions current state mind deterrents safety plans whether person seems reliable says kill widely known people kill leaving emergency departments hospitals people killed hospitals direct observation many assessments become adversarial time psychiatrist sees patient hospital lot already happened hospitals i practiced crisis teams paramedics police assessed person community brought hospital people psychiatric care time intervention friends family members patient people called first responders patient usually concern welfare may aware psychiatrist comes around sometime next hours interaction unfolds people seem interested fact might kill getting hospital may priority approach might one non disclosure denial i really say i suicidal i mean i drunk high time even responses vary unlikely patient serious self inflicted gunshot wound unlikely patient delusional depression stopped midst suicide attempt possible intoxication history suicidal ideation sober interview dynamic also quite variable person may sullen irritated wanting discuss much information may express concerns self incrimination i know i say psychiatrists i know i say wrong thing lock me throw away key may blame problems psychiatrist look i know care me thing care covering ass going whatever want may hostile sarcastic look i really going kill myself i would sitting talking i dead i would talking statements ignore fact person sitting front psychiatrist result actions several people including persons affiliated best interests heart situation intense uncomfortable prevents physicians going psychiatry i many physicians tell me could go psychiatry guessing whether person kill stressful many ways reduce guesswork involved point i trying make behaviors consistent patient undergone change conscious state longer acting like person interested self preservation person contemplating self destruction taking active measures hide thought pattern main reason psychiatrists ca predict suicide long periods time degree certainty person conscious state changes completely actions less predictable even point may potentially self destructive want cover also risk factor analysis imperfect case diagnosis lot clinicians impression person satisfies written criteria diagnosis provides lot critical information potential suicide many clinicians seem miss point patient exact written criteria major depression psychotic features chronic markers suicide risk assessment suddenly much likely attempt suicide thing changed patient conscious state awareness suicide unwanted state evidence happens clinical ample patients report back psychiatrists conscious state psychiatrist miss either way clinician situation could make correct call without clear markers way figure change conscious state occurred patient usually recognizes retrospect clinical information assessment suicide makes jama psychiatry article interesting article authors attempt determine predictors suicide soldiers year following psychiatric hospitalization within veteran administration hospital system year period total hospitalizations total army personnel month period time total deaths suicide number army suicides authors consider long list potential risk factors largely demographic nature determine concentration risk suicide list includes law enforcement data base clinicians access overall goal determine practical identify high risk patients post hospitalization intervention whether might cost effective way prevent suicide able identify highest risk group hospitalizations suicides occurred like many similar studies authors also comment actuarial methods usually trump clinicians making predictions i found limited commentary fact generally possible illustrate want enough variables used say large enough spreadsheet case looked large number variables come predictors analysis i reviewed hospital records consisting printout electronic health record scarcely words usually impossible determine admission discharge date information even short term assessment suicide risk scant frequently says basically patient told going make suicide attempt cases rating scale approach like columbia used clinicians using scales often surprised variables change initial rating numerical risk necessarily reflect inpatient versus outpatient population i read article i also impressed amount alien statistics fairly esoteric statistical terms jama psychiatry wants include methods i think example calculations bibliography additional reading would minimal requirement addition statistical reviewers comments independent statistical discussion pros cons methods would enhance quality discussion one concerns statistical methods get abstract vague notions big data accepted clinical complexity wisdom completely diluted i saw headline day internet sellers know personality spouse fairly obvious healthcare research done based hedis healthcare effectiveness data information set information demographic variables product choices thing clinical assessment treatment headlines artificial intelligence replacing doctors ever comes true happen machine implement required knowledge performance computers sifting text based findings diagnostic criteria know years reference data points generally far superior demographics i owned programs bother sell anymore terms assessment treatment suicide knowledge base included harvard medical school guide suicide assessment intervention might step right direction lot knowledge depends skill particular clinician includes personality factors clinicians continue impossible job day day trying predict suicide prevent ca currently done algorithm i see algorithm i consider high risk people seen follow hospital rather get intervention i would mind errors false positive side george dawson md dfapa kessler rc warner ch ivany petukhova mv rose bromet ej
