i paraphrasing david healy previous post i emphasize side effects healy comment serves counterpoint highly successful multi decade advertising campaign pharmaceutical companies began first national depression screening day emphasis identifying treating depression antidepressants real discussion antidepressant side effects general problem side effects medications since antidepressant treatment conceptualized comprehensive treatment wrapped pill capsule bias continues today various political forces shifted depression screening annual event primary care clinics health care organizations states consider depression screening serial ratings depression quality markers health care services despite fact definite problems idea unless highly specific screening test screening procedure potential expose people side effects treatment highly specific screening test depression second factor considering side effects physician role doctors trained identify treat conditions surgery medications psychiatrists additional training psychotherapy training emphasis making correct diagnosis selecting medication useful even though medical training long longest might follow patient might couple years medical practice ability see people decades rather months years medical treatment changes years also observe first hand long term toxicity many medications might exposed theoretical basis training practicing physician expected help people deal fact side effects medications using may useful fact many cases may beneficial may causing harm good experience side effects leads clinicians develop new practices never trained early career i experience treating person antidepressant years headaches depression like many people chronic depression stressful situation could remove chronic depression context chronic stressor going away point headaches resolved depression improved decided taper antidepressant came weeks later said i feel much better years i taking medication i realize i felt like i flu cleared early experience led me modify ways i discuss medications people i generally tell people i expect anyone get used medication i often tell people may get used feeling ill rather develop tolerance medication side effects i tell experiencing side effects let me know decide time i let know range experiences medications might expect example i might say people might take medication notice taking anything people might tolerate i let know fda contraindications cases i review many times i discuss common side effects usually provide medlineplus handout medication i think comprehensive handouts gives fda black box warnings red box front every handout i talk rare potentially serious side effects like drug induced liver disease arrhythmias look case atypical antipsychotics i discuss movement disorders metabolic effects i demonstrate movements tardive dyskinesia may look like i let people know medications taking potentially addictive i case lithium i let people know unique toxicities safest possible way take case antidepressants i let people know may difficult stop due discontinuation symptoms side effect discussions people taught me valuable lessons people placebo responders nocebo responders nocebo responders develop problems taking medication even medications generally well tolerated low doses aware problem decline discussion side effects might say want medlineplus handout i read side effects i probably get would rather surprised whenever i encounter attitude i respect wishes advise contact me side effects i also recall forensic psychiatry lectures residency instructor advised could sued side effect discussions prevented patient taking useful medication adverse outcome result i realized years basing decisions whether could sued generally bad idea sued anything i think people need hear really happens psychiatric medications consider myself good source information i also found hearty group people decide try tolerate side effects let me know despite discussion i see follow appointment say well know doc i pretty good headache first three days medications i decided keep taking see would go away sure enough day headache gone tell me even though i advised tolerate side effects call me side effects patients almost always men history avoiding doctors taking care i guess experience confirms people develop tolerance side effects would want i large conference treatment anxiety disorders listened renowned psychopharmacologist talk technique treating anxiety disorders ssri snri type antidepressants approach keep titrating medication point toxicity back lower dose experience taught me best approach non acute situations use lowest possible dose usually dose recommended anxiety disorders titrate exact point symptoms remission i never compelled increase medication multiple based pill size drug level based aggregate experience cohort people drug trial i obsess hypothetical physicians practice aware trends medications prescribed psychiatry exception drug interactions area focus psychiatry since first learned fluoxetine could inhibit hepatic metabolism tricyclic antidepressants could lead antidepressant toxicity i treat people often mind boggling combination medications chronic illnesses psychiatric disorders i routinely run lists one computerized drug interaction software packages software inconsistent i often look case report study suggest specific interaction problem i make decision accept reject software telling me qtc interval interval electrocardiogram corresponds total time ventricular contraction relaxation major concern since approval ziprasidone complicated lately fda concern citalopram may prolong qtc interval people significant extent i screen people electrocardiograms appears clinical status total medication burden may lead prolongation qtc interval cases concern hypothetical requires inductive reasoning current textbooks literature standard prescribing references create illusion times everything known medication matter finding plenty examples true lot uncertainty medication safely effectively prescribed illustrate consider hypothetical situation patient bipolar disorder may benefit taking lithium time residency training renal toxicity lithium openly debated nephrologists time certainly believed nephrotoxic large series patients described minimal signs renal toxicity clinical practice treating patients severe bipolar disorder lead me situations i treated patients dialysis kidney transplantation estimation glomerular filtration rate gfr hour urine collections also problematic greatly improved practice using calculated gfrs i doubt taking lithium period time lead renal failure portion patients taking anyone prescribing lithium needs aware fact take measures necessary minimize episodes lithium toxicity exposure nephrotoxins cases like nsaids toxins well known cases like tenofovir interactions known fact scan entire fda approved package insert might find references lithium making decision may take hours weekend study figure best course action i hope i made case psychiatric medications needing careful analysis side effects initiated continued decision take medications serious one years practice i met single person told me liked take medications decision take medications often comes tried everything else realizing major change necessary get back want recent reply previous blog post described medications tools rather panacea i think perfectly safe effective medications invented true healy point advertising notion take antidepressant get better false psychiatrists trained help navigate complicated process recovery depression side effects potential side effects generally complicated aspect george dawson md dfapa additional clinical note another blogger sent me mail earlier week asking me send list psychiatrists i thought competent taper people ssri snri type antidepressants intention

hearing thoughts problem ssri snri discontinuation symptoms variable experiences people trying get problem diagnosed treated additional clinical note processes i describing post take time many cases equivalent amount time required psychotherapy longer i people telling me physicians types seem poised prescription pad tell me nobody ever informed risks potential side effects medication i think problem investigated would difficult idea medication management psychiatry internal medicine field brief uncomplicated encounter takes little thinking part physician largely invention business interests seeking reimburse physicians lowest possible rate consumer medical services consider approach post ask discussions i describe
