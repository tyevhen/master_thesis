long last blogger going kaput couple days usual stuff inositol post wait bit i sure people interested cannabis days away assuming i get distracted something else along way often case anyway research team massachusetts general hospital i attended meetings i resident published good paper journal affective disorders second tier natural antidepressants review critique paper goes r rosea chromium htp inositol i going start inositol i could use second messaging review myself i looked specifically patient well even though talking natural supplements i still contend evolutionary psychiatry none ancestors chugging vats inositol far i know figuring things work helps understand biochemistry speculate could going might end inositol deficiency first let mention first tier natural antidepressants complementary medicine treatments stuff generally considered herbals alternative medicine solid evidence base scientific literature i using quotes i see need distinguish things much evidence base i care someone thinks meditation flakey new age work certainly life changing results high horse well studied herbals growing consensus antidepressant effectiveness safety include st john wort omega fatty acids folate acupuncture exercise alternative treatments studies efficacy antidepressants inositol much evidence base treatments previous paragraph talk evidence shown efficacy least trials years larger others better controlled others favorite alternative treatment cause mania unless folate cycle humming along become evil homocysteine warned inositol sugar alcohol isomer glucose varieties found mostly within cell membranes myo inositol abundant stereoisomer making total free inositol body humans generally consume gram inositol day abundant grains beans nuts fruits might surprised know best sources organ meats beef heart liver also wheat germ uh oh would phytic acid wheat germ bind inositol well inositol part phytic acid ca actually break typically animal sources bioavailable phytate plant sources inositol however i ai gon na lie make inositol glucose evidence limited capacity make inositol dietary deficiency may matter eat maybe gram day kidneys make grams day inositol sometimes called vitamin inositol human body well tons things actually key part second messenger system que well pony express line cell surface proteins receptor complexes mailer hand signals second messengers riders ponies pass signal along eventually cell systems message recipients nucleus major neurotransmitter systems use inositol part messaging line i talking dopamine norepinephrine serotonin acetylcholine potential importance inositol psychiatric disorders thereby evident one considers number receptor types subtypes interact signal transduction pathway biochem nerds already know next bit biochem nerd wan na listen rest skip picture bit little dry inositol used make inositol triphosphate ip diacylglycerol dag ip binds ip receptors particularly calcium channels endoplasmic reticulum cause calcium levels cytoplasm increase causing cascade intracellular activity calcium dag activate protein kinase kinases goes around sticking phosphates things leading altered activity anyone learning molecular biology biochemistry see pathway mentioned many times eyeballs glaze short inositol vital picture wikipedia discussion comments lithium posts lithium interfering inositol metabolism specifically interferes inositol monophosphatase possibly leading reduced recycling inositol ip cell reduced inositol levels however unclear actual end product reduction second messenging something else one theory bipolar disorder caused hyperkinetic second messenger systems imaging study seems confirm something screwy going second messenger systems bipolar disorder one sure yet heck means theory depression side bipolar disorder might result reduction inositol manic episodes depressive disorders might result reduced signaling first place leading inefficient cell energetics mechanics build toxic calcium wrong places wrong times sounds nasty ready clinical data ie really interesting practical stuff study back found decreased inositol levels spinal fluid depressed patients however subsequent studies replicate finding levels inositol spinal fluid predict response inositol post mortem examination suicide victims shown lowered myo inositol levels magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed reduced myo inositol levels frontal lobes bipolar unipolar depressed patients dietary administration shown increase inositol concentration within central nervous system humans work comments people mentioned taking inositol mg several times day good effect well number trials controlled open label trials average dose grams day would mg capsules divided times day would mean would go bottle little six days putting monthly cost minus shipping inositol also available powder seems like could bit cost effective prescription doses studied trials showed benefit others showed improvement weeks definite improvement weeks trials adjunctive treatment meaning mood stabilizers bipolar depression little promising one patient develop mania weeks inositol studies done people respond traditional antidepressants even modest effect promising called treatment resistant patients tend treatment resistant kinds interventions additional studies typically using even inositol grams day positive results anxiety bulimia obsessive compulsive disorder inositol seems disorders bit like nature ssri inositol downside besides needing take mountains side effects trials included mild increases plasma glucose gas nausea sleepiness insomnia dizziness headache case reports mania antidepressant including light therapy cause mania vulnerable people one dropped trials due side effects inositol inositol appear drug drug interactions however might induce uterine contractions pregnant women used pregnancy end inositol might helpful people would interesting see organ meat eating paleos higher inositol levels cns average grain eater eat lot beef heart reach grams daily st john wort product studies i seen past suggest unlikely get standard doses product sjw shelf also probably maoi definitely major drug interactions birth control pills coumadin sjw product i routinely recommend reasons rcts pharmaceutical grade one done massachusetts general hospital research group worked well prescription antidepressants chris kresser suggests work well placebo personally i think reviews published unpublished studies prescription antidepressants give advantage placebo short term likely work better long term pain many ways side effects long term effects generally unknown favorite source unbiased evidenced based information psychiatric meds dr daniel carlat
