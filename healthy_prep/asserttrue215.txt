alcohol abuse third leading cause preventable death behind smoking obesity creating burden economy billion year data twin studies studies long suggested strong genetic component alcoholism widely claimed heritability alcoholism number supported national institute alcohol abuse alcoholism example well least one meta analysis twin adoption studies dissenting meta analysis see paper one expects alcoholism turn simple matter inheriting one two alcoholism genes although one time fact hope instead expected multiple genetic features probably interact produce propensity develop alcohol dependence even alcoholism heritable people say involves tractable number genes dozens scores rather hundreds thousands candidate genes fairly easy discover using powerful new tools dna analysis candidate snps single nucleotide polymorphisms jump right page hit face gene copy number variants involved readily apparent genes involved pretty obvious pretty fast find genome wide association studies gwas able account small proportion known heritability alcoholism small proportion heritability problem true also gwas investigations things like body height trait even heritable alcoholism variability human body height accounted genetic features thought control fact general failure gwas account heritable conditions widespread papers written general idea behind gwas common disease common variant hypothesis says common diseases attributable potentially many allelic variants genetic differences present sizable percentage population gwas several hundred thousand million single nucleotide polymorphisms snps assayed per person times hundreds often thousands individuals statistics expected versus actual rate occurrence various snps calculated snps appear travel together generations assessed linkage disequilibrium determine associated often normal population statistics would predict data sets generated gwas enormous statistical calculations challenging description technique see article also see piece criticisms technique spirited rebuttal criticisms one best known gwas alcoholism studies called german study treutlein et al study likely underpowered statistically authors admit included study subjects dsm iv alcohol dependence control individuals study claimed detected replicated evidence association markers alcoholism although snps genes rest used called junk dna two met criteria genome wide significance two snps met criteria genome wide significance colocated base pairs apart chromosomal region long arm chromosome less well known gwas conducted two samples korean

baseline data another study often called sage study bierut et al looked alcohol abuse subjects controls snps interest identified one snp identified rs among identified german study reach genome wide significance said researchers top association signals replicated independent datasets present study replicate two genome wide significant results reported treutlein colleagues one independent datasets large family based study families genotyped individuals second study alcohol dependent men community based comparison subjects german descent heath et al looked individuals alcohol dependent australian twin registry hard interpret heath writeup appears study population twins parents twins controls non alcohol dependent twins imagine twin study also gwas findings reached genome wide significance p study top snps effect sizes less variance ranked p value association heavy drinking effect sizes greater median effect size words main finding one small effect sizes heath writeup quite clear point stating primary conclusion analyses many complex phenotypes body mass index effect sizes contribution individual genetic variants differences heaviness alcohol consumption alcoholism risk small perhaps accounting little one tenth one percent variance fact heath et al found snps effect size terribly helpful alcoholism prediction standpoint theory snps put together might account phenotypic variance effects addictive reality unlikely inherit defects together clear whether inherit one copy two even raises alcoholism risk often claimed heath group also reported snps tagging snps confirmed german alcoholism gwas study replicated analyses snps tagging snps identified strongly associated snps sage study words german results replicate heath study results bierut et al edenberg et al case control study involving people found somewhat encouraging results arguably although single snp met genome wide criteria significance researchers found top snps german study significant primary analysis alcohol dependence p value stated sense german results replicated edenberg although means clear edenberg snps among german group top snps read study carefully says top also using variety types evidence edenberg et al argue cluster genes chromosome associated alcohol dependence effect sizes given noted genome wide significance mentioned several times fairly stringent criterion need arises fact time look frequency numbers million data points statistically likely jump producing false positives unless correct sheer number data points reading studies smoking pistols found snps suggestive relationship alcohol dependence i would exactly call results strong general studies found different snps different genes couple exceptions many snps genes introns studies terribly robust terms replication neither within studies certainly hope finding alcoholism gene singular dashed fact appears unlikely gene kind found explain tenths percent likelihood gotten alcoholism parents grandparents alcoholism heritable know runs families yes mean percent genetic lots things genetic run families poverty political beliefs tooth fairy myth etc affirmative answer question back rubbed
