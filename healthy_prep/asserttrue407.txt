day i wrote damning critique darwin theory offered nothing way positive alternative traditional view accumulated point mutations driving force evolution easy take potshots someone else theory walk away rule i like naysayers criticize something offer nothing return i like take moment try offer different perspective evolution particular i like offer theory new genes arise question new genes comes course one foremost open problems biology current theory revolves mostly around gene duplication followed modification duplicated gene via mutations deletions survival pressure reference gene fusion fission also proposed mechanisms gene origination addition genes derived noncoding dna recently described drosophila likewise transposons genes jump one location another implicated gene biogensis problem theories various enzymes required order duplication transposition fusion fission etc occur say nothing transcription translation initiation translation elongation existing theories explain participating enzymes appeared first place fully general theory start assumption pre cellular pre chromosomal pre organismic times genes existed may occurred singly multiple copies arising non enzymatic replication likewise assume early protein making machinery probably non enzymatic say entirely rna based i ribozymal idea catalytic rna new sounds unreasonably farfetched please review nobel prize research altman cech fundamental mechanisms de novo gene creation available pre enzymatic times might well nothing ribozymal duplication nucleic acid sequences followed erroneous translation erroneous translation two fundamental types frameshifted translation reverse translation reverse translation means transcription antisense strand dna subsequent translation polypeptide dna parsed bases time base combinations called codons codon corresponds amino acid single base spuriously added deleted gene reading frame disrupted hugely different amino acid sequence results called frameshift error frameshift mutation spurious addition deletion single base free floating piece single stranded genetic material rna dna needed order cause frameshifted translation protein results frameshift error course general vastly different original protein pre organismic nucleic acids single stranded reverse translation would require reading nucleic acid well reading hand early nucleic acids double stranded normal direction translation strand would suffice give one normal one reverse translation product note non biologists known current organisms reading dna rna takes place direction nucleic acids rna dna directionality defined orientation sugar backbone molecules terms carbons interesting speculate role reverse translation production novel proteins especially applies early biological systems know early systems relied triplet codons even four bases guanine cytosine adenine thymine existed beginning also know amino acids beginning may fewer novel possibility early triplet codons palindromic giving identical semantics read either direction palindromic codons codon lexicon aga gag cac aca ata tat aaa today encode amino acids commonly used palindromic codon world distinction sense antisense nucleic acid sequences vanishes single stranded gene made palindromic codons could translated either direction give polypeptide sequence chirality arising terminal polarity example sequence ggg cac gcg aaa would give polypeptide glycine histidine alanine lysine whether translated forward backward difference forward version would glycine terminus whereas reverse version would glycine terminus secondary tertiary structures two versions would long catalytic function directly depend amino carboxy terminus end acid two proteins would also functionally indistinguishable codon palindromicity potentially important system single stranded genes bidirectionally translated case gene happen rely heavily palindromic codons reverse translated product reasons explained potential functionally paralogous forward translated product extent matching extent palindromic codon usage assumes early organisms pre organismic soups single stranded genes could translated direction direction turns modern organisms differ markedly degree use palindromic codons remarkably prokaryotes whose genes use average palindromic codons complementary strand dna would course contain palindromic complements aga opposite tct ccc opposite ggg etc makes interesting conjecture really apply natural world example organisms actually employ strategies erroneous translation creating new
