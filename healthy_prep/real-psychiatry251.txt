insel tr cuthbert bn medicine brain disorders precisely science may i caught article rdoc criteria classifying mental illnesses based various non descriptive parameters neuroscience journal science couple weeks ago reader blog attest stronger advocate role neuroscience current psychiatric practice future psychiatry me media controversy subject always difficult determine much real controversy exists much made sake media self promotion like much dsm controversy reading article thomas insel bruce cuthbert statements taken face value i think statements consistent position clinicians general scientific also outright clueless areas bias i certainly heard scientists serve cause science well especially goal advance neuroscience bring everyone speed discipline dr insel presented view trainees clinical neurosciences psychiatry neurology neurosurgery rotate year two shared neuroscience i first heard present five years ago i thought great idea time since especially getting response i think less clear would great every department psychiatry neuroscientists staff teach neuroscience also problem neuroscientists focused research rather teaching hand plenty bright people departments know lot brain question reconciling two points come necessary infrastructure yet article authors make seem large clinical problems addressed clinicians fumbling around crude assessment methods list three articles examples rdoc interesting articles one american journal psychiatry proposes computer abstracted data hospital notes converted rdoc criteria better predictors hospital length stay los dsm criteria considering method first impression lot wrong picture first los data tremendously skewed based non clinical practices takes hospital case managers success intimidating physicians skew data favor business rather actual medical psychiatric discharge decisions second quality data inpatient settings incredibly bad due toxic combination electronic health records government billing coding regulations reviewer i seen thousands inpatient records hundreds pages length i found ehr records notoriously poor information content finally i thought rdoc new system designed dependent neuroscience dsm methodology looks dsm biased sketchy clinical data result rdoc diagnosis looking graphic science article top post pretty clear data dimensions integrated data basically clinical data smugness displayed report similar might seen rant antipsychiatrist clinicians might best advised simply aware usefulness dimensional models capture psychopathology result provide reassurance clinicians notes contain relevant detail deriving dimensional measures illness like moli bourgeois gentlemen speaking prose without knowing clinicians may already speak rdoc really average person i see chronic insomnia possible sleep terrors nightmares childhood along social phobia point developed either severe anxiety depression ca recall sequence events currently typically think manic episodes may diagnosed bipolar disorder even though know manic episode know symptoms persisted usually without remission past years course complicated fact using marijuana alcohol opioids excessive amounts since may significant family history psychiatric addiction problems expected childhood adversity adult markers psychological trauma abuse i know talking people repeated initial evaluations years give history twice rarely remember much medications psychotherapy treatment i use placeholder diagnosis pejorative term reference i assume i dealing social phobia patient may childhood idea rdoc diagnosis going give me answer question better dsm diagnosis pure folly ask me least get promised neuroscientific markers promised nimh fact description rdoc articles reminiscent another technology supposed diagnose mental illness quantitative eeg qeeg i know quite lot qeeg i purchased machine promising article technology came journal science i researched using highly skilled eeg techs expert neurophysiology run protocols concluded diagnoses came computerized analysis tracing better chance terms patients presented like rdoc diagnoses computerized analysis qeeg data highly dependent input clinical data collected clinician allowed clinician add subtract clinical variables look diagnosis varied staff researchers nimh need decide superior critical attitude toward physicians use current clinical approaches successful best one obvious analysis many naive ignorant science expect proposed solution would collaborative approach including following recruit train neuroscience teachers already example much i teach trainees interested addiction addiction medicine neuroscience also much realistic waiting every department access neuroscience researchers expecting researchers teach addition research guess every psychiatry department already faculty teach neuroanatomy pharmacology brain science neuroscience already officially scientists make reading list available online article refers published articles focus rdoc criteria available though national library medicine web site along neuroscience articles interest psychiatrists added bonus would cme activity available self study post list neuroscience modules build list previous post i posted two links neuroscience modules nimh i would put two lists one containing growing list modules second list neuroscience concepts need illustrated would useful psychiatrists psychiatrists training medical school professors hoping make basic science lectures relevant since many clinicians still seem difficulty understanding neuroscience important psychiatry better graphics make high resolution graphs illustrate detailed brain anatomy basic science available online teachers pulling material together often difficult part teaching job requires intensive effort run afoul copyright laws would easier recruit neuroscience teachers high quality teaching materials available neuroscience teaching blog addition nimh staff posting references concepts modules open teaching blog also available i would encourage platform discussing concepts present trainees ideally would place active dialogue concepts teaching i think measures would helpful building infrastructure neuroscience teachers neuroscience teaching mechanism widespread dissemination material residency programs educational programs practicing psychiatrists rdoc fact worthwhile plenty brainpower outside nimh figure brainpower currently focused coming solutions resolving problems incredible clinical complexity happens every day i plan send recommendation
