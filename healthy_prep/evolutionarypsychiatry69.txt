beginning september bit twitter new paper neurology fact folks emailed me links tweeted attention paper turns interesting tell way written researchers pretty stoked results always sneak dry modern medical literature funny little bit almost every scientific paper sobering end paragraph limitations study hand followed several paragraphs lame data one reason another paper says study limitations also significant strengths reason i find amusing i fairly easy amuse awolnation kill heroes i really like paper glorious way attempt link inflammation hyperglycemia coagulation glucose body brain pathology beautiful bold bit outside box i used seeing neurology paper let dive course know hyperglycemia type ii diabetes linked cognitive decline brain aging dementia also insulin resistance obesity higher caloric intake time also linked faster brain aging high ish levels fasting blood glucose still normal range well even linked systemic inflammation researchers thought would run observational study see could see structural changes brain time related fasting glucose levels random sample year old australians selected compulsory voting rolls individuals underwent mri scanning fasting glucose testing wave also scanned four years later wave exclusionary criteria weeded including anxiety depression type ii diabetes incidentally found fasting glucose higher mmol l mg dl i used seeing stroke neurologic disorders etc scans used make current dataset bunch measures taken included well blood pressure medications education sex smoking bmi apoe phenotype hippocampi wikimedia commons scans perused volume hippocapmus measured fasting plasma glucose individuals ranged mmol l calculations whatnot done fasting glucose level wave varied linearly amount hippocampal atrophy years later researchers flipped find way screw findings adjusted smaller intracranial volumes measured second time took anyone fasting glucose stringent criteria recommended american diabetes association wondering sample skewed highest normal fasting glucose folks atrophy excluded anyone greater normal bmi line remained pretty linear analysis added back type ii diabetics high fasting glucose folks line still linear seems pretty clear higher fasting glucose smaller hippocampus four years later least year old australian certain geographic region turns average rate hippocampal atrophy year old per year rate found average fasting plasma glucose level sample nice synchronicity fun experiment even fun data discussion exitement nearly gets hand evolutionary psychiatry level pathological lumping i love animal models rats higher plasma glucose greater brain damage exposed certain toxins specifically reduction hippocampal dendritic spine density humans higher normal fasting glucose associated greater risk developing type diabetes poorer memory performance higher glucose levels associated increased inflammatory cytokines tnf alpha il il inflammatory markers peaked higher lasted longer impaired glucose tolerance chronic systemic inflammation known cause cerebral atrophy likely mechanism behind correlation increased glucose neurodegeneration another feature type diabetes increased levels certain clotting factors blood increases lead increased risk vascular heart disease diabetics prediabetics folks metabolic syndrome also similar clotting factor abnormalities inducing hyperglycemia normal volunteers also induces platelet activation pro clotting factors clotting means risk microemboli small strokes vascular brain damage time since systemic inflammation coagulopathies also seem induce eachother could two together synergistically amplify risk something like chronically high glucose level taking another step back known depression anxiety associated increased risk diabetes high stress activation mediated increased hpa axis activation associated increased risk diabetes also increased risk brain atrophy particularly hippocampus amygdala memory problems could psychological stress leads hpa activation increases glucose levels leading brain atrophy yes stress eventually kill stops making stronger life funny way high fasting glucose levels great idea please get idea i endorsing vlc diet point remember fasting glucose levels insulin senstive individuals tend low lower regularly consume carbs i think vlc diets place i unconvinced perfect anti aging tool everyone
