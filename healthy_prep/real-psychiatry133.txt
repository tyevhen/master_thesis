i pointed several times blog number non medical forces state minnesota successful making mediocre mental health system one brink becoming travesty curiosity naturally piqued i heard suicide prevention plan released time suicide prevention week suicide prevention awareness month suicide prevention awareness possible seriously deteriorating nonsystem care people writing report say person actively involved suicide prevention every day career i decided read give impressions full text available anyone minnesota department health web site scanning document readable main body pages long relatively large font much organized like outline rather document reasons i outline could lot briefer task force member listed appears none psychiatrists listed task force members one physician stated goal work reduce suicide minnesota five years ten years ultimately working towards zero page certainly laudable goal recent reviews ongoing debates whether suicide eliminated recent consensus statement says buried page statement encourage health care systems implement zero suicide model link provided samhsa model product non experts promotion managed care i consider samhsa reliable source information expertise review available zero suicide model illustrates basically management heavy model used considered standard psychiatric care psychiatric care disrupted business interests usual ehr kowtowing far reduced rates total suicides state useful question whether trends suicide rates total number suicides real trend minnesota reflects expected variation second important question whether population wide phenomenon reflects subpopulations impacting statewide rates authors attempt answer questions showing increase rates suicide per per last year complete data report ratio men women died suicide rate across minnesota rate slightly less national rate among subgroups population american indian group highest rate per followed white per black african americans lowest rate per american indian youth highest rate per standard method determine death trends related risk factors illness significant joinpoint regression analysis developed national cancer institute analyze trends cancer deaths since used cdc researchers looking trends suicide rates i see application kind analysis rates year period time discussed article mean done apparent minimum analysis longer term trends accomplished along comparisons macro indicators like economic variables would interesting basis preventive recommendations authors leap model called social ecological model suicide adapted world health organization graphic included statement model appears generally applied widely adopted cdc way address suicide violence also colon cancer host medical problems seems modern equivalent old nature versus nurture schizophrenigenic mother argument cataloguing perceived deficiencies environment thing discovering mechanism cause specific problem specific person obvious examples abound vast majority people significant childhood adversity environment attempt commit suicide relevant question better approach may studying people trying figure survived either adapt chronic levels insomnia anxiety depression resolve consciousness based model may best approach authors seem say social economical factors need addressed approach going use reduce suicide rate even using approach overstep limits model end using familiar political approach political approach i referring assume somehow know suicide professional trained address i speak psychiatrists serious overstepping authority i board certified psychiatry well known time candidate demonstrate could interview person assess potential suicide aggression would fail oral examination psychiatrists focused timely assessments suicide aggression decades incorporated treatment guidelines every level assessments done day practically every psychiatrist working day yet minnesota plan following guidance train professionals community cultural leaders increase awareness suicide prevention efforts mental health wellbeing p train professionals community spiritual cultural leaders better understand talk encourage risk access help p objective expect providers interact individuals risk suicide routinely assess access lethal means p authors make statements non specific possible psychiatrists mentioned document neither mental health professionals speaking psychiatrists practicing psychiatry people severe forms mental illness assess treat suicide aggressive behavior certainly looking state agency training accountability accountable people treat professional standards furthermore acutely aware deficiencies care state input psychiatrists would probably useful tactic pretending tell professionals job generally behave used managed care industry years disappointing unexpected see document state friendly industry i say without doubt minnesotans seeking acute care family member suicidal thinking suicidal behavior disappointed severe rationing psychiatric services resulted lack resources would comparable medical emergency families frequently directed hospital emergency departments mental disorders viewed creating congestion inconvenience social workers making assessments know placement options extremely limited legislative response rationing psychiatric services mandate patient transferred nearest bed hundreds miles away hospitalized people realize inpatient units supposed help grim unsanitary places main goal convince psychiatrist longer suicidal discharged home family may find uneasy position monitoring suicidal family member home trying get adequate treatment logical progression events government insurance industry standard dangerousness reason person admitted psychiatric unit days managed care reviewers call physicians nurses charge looking day patient use word suicidal point according insurance industry patient must discharged always excuse attending psychiatrist become modern day joke psychiatrist administration insist patient discharged might need find another job work crisis care suicidal aggressive people based informed approach problem risk factors protective factor analysis really insufficient approach approach suicide epiphenomenon psychiatric disorders also limited approach certainly correlates high suicide rates major psychiatric disorders person came consider suicide generally unique pathway even case extreme mental illness first emergency department triage must go reason exists inadequate funding community mental health centers crisis services paradigm model dane county mental health center madison wisconsin one epicenters community psychiatry active crisis service runs day long pm walk crisis center adequately staffed avoid long waits active crisis psychotherapy second inpatient psychiatry needs serious revision longer accept idea person crisis sits inpatient unit say longer suicidal granted always social interventions along way lot needs happen units need clean calm comfortable places need provide array active services treat severe problems address suicidal thinking need keep longitudinal data efficacy interventions need provide assessments treatments alcohol substance use disorders many people become suicidal influence alcohol street drugs importantly need admit people severe problems even saying suicidal time reasons twofold majority people significant mental illnesses treated function logical point provide treatment reduce transition suicide risk reason many severely ill people clearly function current level distress may attempted suicide past psychiatrist knows high risk community currently hospital residential settings people admitted read document make assessment goals modifying social fabric various communities minnesota seem unrealistic me i think group parent document overreaching scope done apparently little funding also gross inconsistencies government business bigger conflicts interest days government seems want advertise solving problems opposite businesses functional state department health use usual public health tools education top attainable straightforward goals would public education suicide especially statistics risk factors fact suicide treatable resolvable condition means reduction public health level successful interventions example people need know firearm home single risk factor suicide i get letter every year telling me i report number abortions i performed last year abortion complications minnesota people access professional information know i never performed abortion i never investigated origin letter conclude law written anti abortion legislators hoping shame physicians performing legal abortions anyone using functional approach sending conceal carry permit holders letter suicide gun possession taught public health classes schools everyone know deaths firearms country suicide cultural permissiveness toward substance use minnesota medical cannabis laws active group recreational cannabis promoters current nation wide movement view psychedelics hallucinogens medications psychotherapeutic agents little discussion downside also midst highly lethal opioid epidemic addiction psychiatrist many people i talk get point addiction search getting high care live die knew taking lethal near lethal amounts care cases certain people alcohol use problems become suicidal intoxicated correlates substance use disorders suicidal lethality substance use practically unknown people trendy cool push back overwhelming pressure get high exactly needs happen stay sober reduce chances ever suicidal depend managed care companies provide reasonable system care record good one idea managers whoever might going teach coerce professionals providing better care people suicidal thinking working three decades opposite seems absurd me government wanted anything would provide functional oversight companies ongoing rationing care every state physician review agency treatments outside usual company reviewers insurance industry insiders placed state regulatory boards board last word treatments necessary community mental health centers need refunded
