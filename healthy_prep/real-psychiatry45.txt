reference permission friend mine insists telling me dream knows i interested i old house i feeling grandmother house really house i never gathering main floor two people i know one supposed grandmother look like guy apparently dating grandmother i know supposed handyman brother introduced grandmother i never seen either look like reality know grandmother dead years suddenly i longer party i house i upstairs bedroom reason i think grandmother bedroom i know i sudden guy comes hallway one commentators tmz hollywood gossip show let call bob i look floor next wall right two small bowls ms bowl green ms closer bowl red ms closer me anchor hocking glass bowls without blue plastic lids anyway i grab small handful start eating dark chocolate ms i look bob say starts eating asks i i say i heard mouse i need kill mouse runs me bob i tell kill misses runs me i kick knock corner bob still reluctant kill mouse runs me time big rat i kick corner room time runs back me longer looks like rat big otter i kick time i shaken awake wife asks me i bad dream said i kicking legs like i running punching arms air seconds heart pounding like i really fight thing mean things dream striking first amount detail recalled right appear product placements people telling me dreams rarely recall level detail often recall emotional tone dream vague idea something happened second overall content dream dreamer report illogical none events really happened likely happen exception tv celebrity none people dream really supposed strangers supposed grandmother grandmother boyfriend reality relationship movement dreamer thrashing bed wife wakes final consideration i like think processing power necessary create experience either de novo existing elements dream interpretation still alive well psychiatry least way i practice quite detailed analysis elements freud thought important combination look predominate affects might called synthesis supposed happen dreams also quite need neuroscientific perspective example part still operating model suggests dream activity occurs rem rapid eye movement sleep nrem non rapid eye movement sleep contains little know dream studies completely correct rem nrem sleep eeg correlates wake research subjects dreams determine dreaming based studies rough correlation still dreams occurring nrem sleep rem sleepers without dreams various theories advanced occurs comprehensive theory issue dream content needs better explanation simplified explanation illogical impossible dreams like one described rem dreams nrem dreams like plausible events finally movement rem dreams possible suggesting dreamer example rem sleep neurological problem account dissociation motor activity fact paralyzed rem sleep thoughts rem nrem sleep pervasive society i routinely interview patients tell me think getting enough rem sleep i lucky found recent paper subject correct may prove landmark study neural basis dreaming possibly consciousness one advantages paper written perspective consciousness researchers interest neural correlates consciousness study authors ran three experiments looking question dream reports high density channel eeg used serial wakening model subjects awakened asked report dreaming could recall de dreaming experience experienced something could recall dewr dreaming without recall content third option experience dreaming ne experience asked characterize content according protocol two groups research subjects first group subjects underwent awakenings total second smaller group subjects many awakenings third experiment subjects studied awakenings see results first two experiments could predicted initial section paper reports results de versus ne experience low frequency hz power spectrum authors able

power region condition occurred rem non rem states finding across distinct sleep stages appears highly significant next section paper reports de versus ne high frequency power spectrum hz corresponds

content involving facial recognition noted increase high frequency activity right fusiform gyrus structure noted involved facial recognition wakefulness dream content involved spatial imagery correlated increased high frequency activity right posterior parietal cortex area expected function wakefulness additional correlations noted movement speech final phase experiments authors sought find markers identified initial sections paper could used predict person dreaming based eeg data able accurately predict dreams time accurate across states i consider potentially critical paper psychiatrist interested sleep dreaming replicated illustrates posterior cortical hot zone correlates dreaming across rem nrem sleep stages explains lack tight correlation dreams rem nrem sleep theoretical standpoint point low delta activity hz correlates dreaming also corresponds alternations neuronal depolarization hyperpolarization causes breakdown cortical communication high delta activity corresponds states diminished consciousness including forms delirium loss consciousness suggest posterior cortical activation studied patients disorders consciousness see may consciousness without responsiveness based activity area also discuss broader implications dreaming model study consciousness good point end post i continue monitor work authors following time dr tonini example
