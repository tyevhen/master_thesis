i woke scary story diet soda several days ago least i thought scary clear point reporter lost track story talking regular diet soda interchangeably toxic i see might happen since recent soda scares focused regular soda referred sugary soda sugar current hysteria must eliminated media routinely informs years cholesterol fat vilified wrong fat cholesterol acceptable sugar villain complicate matters message consume large quantities colorful fruits vegetables servings day problem colorful fruits serving per serving basis generally contain much sugar sugary soda latest story presented news headline rather work progress news flash drink diet soda get alzheimer disease stroke fact drink little per day get stroke news outlets talked part story consuming sugary drinks study increase risk dementia stroke even presented way keep hysteria going mean start drinking sugary soft drinks really told me cause strokes alzheimer disease oh right contain well known toxin sugar time self disclosure interest transparency i get real story i eat lot sugary foods i like every imaginable kind desert i generally averse vegetables unless starchy consistency i consumed massive amounts soda diet soda life time i realize everybody story outlier beat food health odds grandpa smoked two packs cigarettes day died old age grandpa ate raw bacon every day died old age point physician anybody i know better challenge medical common sense hope survive i happen health nut consumes junk food i eat meat fat cholesterol i exercise lot i guess proclivity sweet consumption comes i would attribute scandinavian side genome cookies pies cakes donuts coffee course i defend vilify sugar artificial sweeteners fact i would definitely try hardest stop consuming stuff really biohazard self disclosure real story case easy find publicly accessible original research article editorial keep myself honest i wrote article without reading editorial first read original article editorial references respectively full text available one associations i automatically dealing food headlines framingham study study big i medical school offered first exposure epidemiology risk factor analysis cardiovascular pathology built epidemiology course several professors experts board exam questions based knowledge study generations physicians studied papers based study probably react cardiovascular risk factor headlines way i i mildly surprised see study diet soda sugar sweetened drinks based framingham study case researchers looked framingham heart study offspring cohort study began volunteers participants studied examination cycles every years date means cycles far last one occurring purpose study looked year risk stroke dementia beginning th cycle total subjects available exam completed food frequency questionnaire ffq population split based age criteria arm analyzed year risk incident stroke another arm sampled year risk incident dementia ffq used determine total sugary beverage consumption sugary sweetened soft drink artificially sweetened soft drink various rates consumption one bottle equaled one drink answers exam cycle used measure recent intake averaged responses exams used calculate cumulative intake years prospective study time stroke dementia using standard definitions done next ten years examination cycle total number events form article listed article contains tables detailing demographic details cohort consumption sugary artificially sweetened drinks authors also present year survival curves stroke dementia cohorts sample drank least artificially sweetened drink per week drinking one per day stroke cohort total events strokes ischemic stroke recent intake cumulative intake dementia cohort total events cause dementia alzheimer disease recent intake cumulative intake main finding consumption amount artificially sweetened soft drinks associated risk stroke case recent hr cumulative intake hr drinking greater equal artificially sweetened soft drink associated increased risk cause hr alzheimer dementia hr cumulative intake mode controlled two major variables hypertension diabetes mellitus immediately relevant strokes dementia controlling diabetes mellitus intake artificially sweetened beverages remained significant predictor stroke cause dementia alzheimer dementia diabetes found partial mediator effect excluding people hypertension decreased effect artificially sweetened drinks strokes well done prospective study hrs artificially sweetened soda stroke risk appear robust nearly doubling rate across board also dose related effect hrs subjects drinking day artificially sweetened drink greater rate drinking drinks week dementia significant hrs noted cumulative intake day authors good job listing limitations study point ethnic minorities limits generalizability populations non european decent true may also true study generalizable white populations provide usual disclaimer causality observational studies discuss recall bias ffq previously discussed validity recall coke pepsi product range mentioned undetermined confounding variables also adjust multiple comparisons surprising study many variables seemed weakest methodological link i thought bit study clear mechanism strokes dementia would produced artificial sweeteners discuss theories compounds implicated increasing cardiometabolic risk factors factor several compounds consumed public years fda provides information compounds extensively studied safety animals humans possible fda missed excessive cardiovascular cerebrovascular dementia mortality due high intensity sweeteners approach seems suggest average daily intake adi compounds suggest consuming amount course lifetime safe main factor affects physicians think studies whether supporting contradictory data paper lists nurses professional health professionals follow study showed artificially sweetened sugar sweetened soft drinks associated higher risk stroke years follow women years follow men sample size large women men pooled relative risk stroke authors suggest drinking decaffeinated coffee reduced risk authors also listed northern manhattan study showed artificially sweetened soda increased combined risk vascular events stroke editorial authors list two negative studies first association coronary heart disease biomarkers coronary heart disease sugar sweetened beverages artificially sweetened beverages second study showed identical result risk sugar sweetened artificially sweetened beverages i always skeptical results studies many variables clear cut effects least replicated good study quoted years ca believe hear media physicians researchers raises significant questions i think useful known literature order discuss people need take specific medications increase cardiometabolic risk like atypical antipsychotics personal level question anything done clear although study points increased risk majority research subjects ingested diet soda experience adverse outcome test period basic literature search shows many epidemiological studies looking various adverse outcomes artificial sweetener exposure positive findings i take sign i need get disciplined terms intake high intensity sweeteners well sugar take something toxic even theoretical risk answer course preferences time preferences die hard wish me luck george dawson md dfapa
