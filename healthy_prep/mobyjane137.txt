i driving appointment yesterday desolate feeling loneliness came me i felt unloved unworthy unimaginably isolated disconnected world around me christmas lights along way cheering frozen heart turn help moments deep despair i driving fast moving traffic busy highway often times i use mental exercises change mood meditations gratitude prayer kind i seemed unable choose one perhaps spiritual lack rather problem depression anybody love me i wondered anybody love me ahead distance large lovely trees beautiful clouds overhead billowing another storm i found myself talking love me trees care me i acceptable accept me trees i okay please know i i right i child universe like keep me company love me trees clouds love me i right i told need surrender surrender matter idea surrendering surrendering life therefore surrending life longer separate life i think maybe i trying surrender myself trees clouds i felt isolated healing thing happened yesterday ended i love trees i love clouds thank thank thank
