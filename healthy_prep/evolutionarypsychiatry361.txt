one looks books internet paleolithic style evolutionary based diet one likely confused end focus kurt harris calls paleo enactment meaning hunting wild boar digging roots honey okay i first told friend mine happens gastroenterologist johns hopkins interest paleolithic diets remarked guy i ever saw paleo diet pooping leaves blood take object lesson paleo enactors forage unless know paleo folks using kurt harris term knack pc paleo meaning low fat paleo loren cordain boyd eaton scientists paleolithic nutrition pioneers first look research focused fact animals wild tend leaner domesticated animals cordain paleo diet lose weight get healthy eating food designed eat paleo diet athletes nutritional formula peak athletic performance advocate lower fat approach notice published prior research headed time paleo diets studied diabetics staffan lindeberg others relatively low fat sometimes little weird sure many foraged canola oil mayonnaise go irb gets i guess important well good calories bad calories fats carbs controversial science diet health vintage came i think taubes work incredible amazing required reading health professional nutritionist however i believe focuses bit much carbohydrate hypothesis cause western disease however heck lot exonerate fat since good calories bad calories advent many call primal style paleo exemplified best mark sisson excellent book primal blueprint reprogram genes effortless weight loss vibrant health boundless energy like stephan guyenet i think mark little hard carbohydrates starch lot common ultimately different sugar could post time i highly recommend youtube video lecture robert lustig pediatrician obesity expert rather strange idea paleo diet hey everyone anyway primal folks love fat real food allow sensible indulgences high fat dairy dark chocolate red wine rumored even loren cordain pro fat used anthropological reports world show ancestors favored fatty cut meat anyway leaving carcasses lean meat rot savoring glands liver brains marrow high saturated fat fact ancestors forced survive lean meat alone endured life threatening condition called rabbit starvation symptoms fatigue weakness diarrhea hunger headache low blood pressure heart rate come diet much protein ameliorated substituting protein carbohydrates fat i told life animal fat bad me scientific story true explained exhaustive detail number different excellent books including gcbc also eat fat lose fat healthy alternative trans fats i especially like mary enig seems me researcher primarily responsible finally getting fda come nutritional horror industrial trans fats two final scientific arguments saturated animal fats case palmitic acid addressed full previous sources i named one high amount free fatty acids palmitic acid part blood causes insulin resistance erudite fat lover say yes course palmitic acid released bloodstream metabolic action livers every time fast overnight example lose weight otherwise would never burn fat stores ca store much glycogen release palmitic acid signals body might lot food around better preserve precious glucose stores glycogen brain use therefore muscles become insulin resistant shift burning fat fuel rather glucose burning fat sounds good right mechanism physiologic i would say little full body insulin resistance diabetes stephan peter brilliant takes matter required reading mind one said learning nutrition take lot time let get brass tacks insulin resistance palmitic acid debate remember key burn fat lose weight release flood palmitic acid blood stream deadly hard core saturated animal fat yes livers trying fat loss really best treatment diabetes bariatric surgery resultant forced semi starvation fasting fat loss often result immediate turnaround diabetes let see maximum pounds fat loss week calories fat burned less would equal calories fat day grams saturated fat less day supplied rumps hopefully visceral belly fat physiologic insulin resistance fasting short term increase fasting glucose levels diabetics true gary taubes explanation muscle insulin resistance vs overall body insulin resistance good one finding led american diabetic association recommend high carbohydrate diets diabetics years long term huge mistake know feasting stores animal fat help heart disease right i think i fairly addressed insulin resistance let go last best argument fat lipotoxicity perhaps i waited end one rather biochemistry heavy give whirl i full text paper let summarize abstract insulin resistance one pathophysiological features obesity type diabetes recent findings linked insulin resistance chronic low grade inflammation white adipose tissue excess storage saturated fat white adipose tissue due modern life style causes hypertrophy hyperplasia adipocytes exhibit attenuated insulin signaling due production release saturated fatty acids adipocytes recruit macrophages white adipose tissue together initiate proinflammatory response proinflammatory factors saturated fatty acids secreted bloodstream white adipose tissue impair insulin signaling non adipose tissues causes whole body insulin resistance let leave insulin resistance bit go proinflammatory section basically paper says stuff fat cells full fat release saturated fat get inflammation hate inflammation evolutionary psychiatry paper seems implicate saturated fat major cause huge part bodies white adipose tissue much stored body fat inflammation called lipotoxicity paleo diet aficionados tend agree following anti inflammatory diet omega fatty acids avoiding omega avoiding grains especially wheat casein eating vegetables fruits avoiding sugar fructose processed food using common sense biochemistry saturated fat anti inflammatory compared either cooked monounsaturated polyunsaturated fat given heat air make vulnerable unsaturated bonds oxidize become rancid everyone agree highly inflammatory bad cold fresh virgin pressed olive oil would escape oxidation i hope science telling saturated fat inflammatory i think full handle i think makes sense speculate lots saturated fat inflammatory combined lots sugar big thanks dr bg helping me clarify mind edit i refined thinking matter since publishing post please see comments thank end edit burning fat signal bodies might lot food around eating carbohydrates signals summertime lots tubers fruit foliage stumbled upon beehive yippie store never situation evolutionary past combined grotesque amount sugar consume year round western diet combined fats dr bg called metabolically speaking putting foot brakes gas time great transmission i think overall important anthropological lessons hunter gatherers healthy excepting infant mortality accidents long lived eating wide variety macronutrient ratios kitavans high carb inuit tokelau masai high fat folks likely somewhere consume tons sugar industrial seed oils wheat i come point epidemiology observation wo show truth show could possibly true saturated fat alone cause heart disease diabetes neither starchy carbohydrates alone facts true unless kitavans inuit blessed magical pancreases livers hearts guess old hearts i hopefully science holistic approach sense tell rest
