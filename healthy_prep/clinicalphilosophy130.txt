intellectual struggles rather piece moral emotional conflicts philosophy let first rehearse main thrust wittgenstein kehre concerning logical structure logical analysis tractatus claimed theoretical possibility making absolutely clear analysing imagined singular logical structure immanent within thought talk makes simplicity complexity makes thought decomposable 'simple names seen something relative analytical schemes interests purposes something 'absolute might also put 'of nature analytic possibility presupposed demonstrated later wittgenstein came realise analysis necessarily purpose relative language codifiable single way therefore said singular logical structure thought nonsense rather reminds me newton discussion scholium mathematical principles natural philosophy called 'absolute motion ordinarily deploy frame reference order establish movement direction speed say man ran miles per hour metres implicitly understand relative points athletics ground relative antelope running hither thither nearby field newton takes example man walking boat say walks east miles per hour speed relative boat newton points though boat moving west relative ocean supposedly 'truer measurement man walking relative ocean yet goes earth moving relative sun etc etc perhaps 'truer measurement relative sun however newton spins idea 'true movement outside context whatsoever wants talk movement relative fixed absolute space coordinates somehow pre exist objects residing within space also time absurdly think talk 'flow presupposes said flow steadily absolutely nature i temporal
