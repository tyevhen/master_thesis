scientists polled recently greatest discovery science majority chose darwin evolution explained much many fields scientific endeavor includes psychotherapy opinion evolution essential treatment emotional problems put differently one make significant progress psychotherapy evolution central process brain developed three major cycles first described paul maclean i describe instinct energy feeling thinking evolved many connections higher levels therapy last evolved cognitive insight therapy neglected great deal evolution tantamount neglecting ancient history course early personal history ignore two thirds brain possibly get well i think thinkers cognitive insight therapists cure patients think better leaves physiology feeling therefore need systematically measure physiologic changes psychotherapy otherwise great new attitudes bodies may degenerating i often called therapy evolution reverse includes evolution kernel sense evolution makes revolutionary overturns current thinking value thinking particularly terms measuring progress psychotherapy feel feel matter exhortations take place often buried feelings determine actions feelings deviated always home brain changed though change thinking denying projecting thoughts bereft feelings essence homeless roots proper psychotherapy must adhere laws biology evolution need find roots basis many thoughts beliefs history mankind found today history man found well follow history reverse must adhere natural order things therapy rebirthing defies evolutionary principles attacking remote early imprints first must start present give good foundation regard current lives associated feelings finally arrive reptilian instinctive brain long time later biologic laws disregarded thus clear rebirthing ever work indeed likely creates damage i seen treated damage ploy mechanism therapist defies evolution end failure evolution merciless unrelenting survived allow cheat principles evolution neglected perforce end abreaction release feeling without connection resolution bioenergetics focusing body muscles violates law focusing bodily release gestalt therapy like ape inadequate lsd hallucinogens completely disregard neurologic order nervous system spray feelings everywhere possible connection primal teach evolution follow neuraxis precisely tell evolution took place brain evolution therapy ever wonder fall asleep reverse order evolution come correct order means first prisoners brain evolution start become consciously aware move highest level brain come antiquity modern life though gone centuries millennia proper order day order achieve consciousness thing primal therapy must strictly obey evolutionary edicts change order sleep trump order sleep psychosis lurks enough dream second line limbic consciousness sleep suffer develop physical mental symptoms crucial trump order primal therapy suffer symptoms birthing dangerous trumps evolution cognitive therapy work trumps feeling areas brain ignores evolution dream sleep primal therapy enters deep unconscious slowly ordered progression deep level lies many remote life death pains shows nightmares associated terrible terror anxiety states demonstrated deep primals heavy pains reside access imprints never know life endangering memories include therapeutic process tells evolutionary beings biologically must adhere history mankind order universe part i stress enough take patients birth traumas first weeks therapy anymore dream sleep go directly deep sleep evolution ordered affair must superimpose ideas theory techniques patients rule decide patient example needs dream analysis neuro feedback rebirthing always patient readiness dictates approach new brain level evolution helps survival otherwise would brainstem early limbic system everything survival breathing blood pressure heart rate body temperature evolution continues survival strategies finishing neocortex structure detect enemies without within feelings helps survive disconnecting source pain self never meet access deep brain structures may never may kill prematurely travel evolutionary time neocortex adds physiologic contribution reason ideas trump feelings feelings integral survival survival system neo cortex also important survival different way coma without neo cortex really working survival functions heart rate blood pressure etc still operational animals survive well without complex neo cortex survive brainstem damaged breathe matter lower level brain function designed keep alive use lower levels modify higher ones work reverse imagine higher level neocortex could permanently modify brainstem functions survive thus feelings certainly sway ideas ideas suppress feelings eradicate see therapy physiology limbic feelings directly affect ideas beliefs rapid heart rate push someone go yet matter hard try often permanently alter heart rate especially rate accompanied anxiety slower heart rate time ideas hundreds millions years away physiological emotional functions know amygdala pretty well mature time birth code register inchoate feelings hippocampus yet fully developed several years precision regarding time place scene origin beyond capacity dredge feeling experiential level verbal one claim practice rebirthing ask words go along event true event overlook brain evolution therapy perform amounts magic patient never wants discuss life sinks immediately past abreact get well observe person history also witnessing ancient history time patient cries like newborn never duplicate sound primal one way know observing patient make motions reliving birth duplicate movement later matter hard tries often see abreaction patients start present begin feeling immediately skip steps goes kind birth trauma kind reliving becomes defense interrupts enhance connection dialectical fashion descend deep unconscious levels immediately become conscious level unconscious transformed consciousness means longer driven specific unconscious forces access inner states thereafter suffer things bleeding ulcer colitis without aware chances however suffer afflictions lower level brain function designed keep alive use lower levels modify higher ones work reverse imagine possible higher level neocortex could permanently modify brainstem functions survive thus feelings certainly sway ideas ideas suppress feelings eradicate see therapy physiology limbic feelings directly affect ideas beliefs rapid heart rate push someone go yet matter hard try often alter heart rate especially rate accompanied anxiety slower heart rate time consciously drive away anxiety ideas hundreds millions years away physiological emotional functions i remember seeing patient started therapy told me since forgave parents feels much better proof ideas trump feeling yet measured stress hormone levels cortisol never changed thus neo cortex trump think feelings without ever touching feelings per se neo cortex adept deceiving produce thought well without really well ideas function anesthetics therapy certainly want anesthetized order get well brain complex proposition stay one level therapy exclusion others means progress made therapy partial reprogramming brain achieve called normal brainwaves biofeedback deficient lead cure wonder call therapy scientific ask elucidate clarify properties nature ask works subjective always accurate difference asking scientific question one requires moral perspective alone know humanity therapy sort pragmatic mechanical solution deep breathing matching brainwaves ideal focus technique patient evolution major difference focus patient evolves learn decide treat beforehand short learn therapy treat human beings psychotherapy matter defying evolution harnessing good mankind darwin legacy
