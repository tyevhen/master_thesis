memorial day project purchasing roomba getting running i big believer robots make lives easier point decided time start walking walk familiar roomba designed robotic vacuum cleaner set rooms programmed basically supposed vacuum floors automatically park docking station charging machine inch diameter disk rises height inches floor light pounds able accommodate sharp angles secondary brush spins arm extends main disk combination main disk spinning extended spinning brush cleans corners room i purchased latest model roomba consulting friends relatives earlier models one considerations buying roomba whether would help turn home even cleaner environment currently tough one friends physician gave opinion home museum like office probably problematic room stacks books journals piled everywhere disarray certainly minimal dust entire first level hardwood flooring typically vacuumed built system credit roomba contains debris machine emptied exhausted air hepa filtered avoid exhausting dust particles main cleaning mechanism consists two debris extractors rubberized bars spin high rate speed across floor surface capture dust hair larger particles interesting aspect roomba going observed behavior two modes vacuuming start spot spin increasing circles outward direction gets foot diameter spirals back center spot typical mode heads room perimeter automatically calculates room size cleaning time valuable tip manual take measures restrict one room time comes two virtual wall lighthousetm devices allow easy demarcation work area fascinating aspect getting started roomba going setting watching went task vacuuming i minor room preparation charged turned loose expected headed straight wall attempted establish perimeter i remembered standard rodent behavior ever confronted mouse open area floor first move dash baseboards run parallel escape strategy works well wild maneuver associated cover makes less susceptible predators works much less well confronted human knows first move yes scientists bred mice exhibit behavior guess would fare well made outside lab roomba behavior less rigid typical mouse exceptions hour minutes took vacuum adjacent kitchen great room circled kitchen island perfectly least times wall perimeters much less predictable times roomba would peel take across room single pass rarely return continue along original wall sometimes would head wall degree angle times degrees never usual adjacent passes human would make using standard vacuum cleaner according literature roomba supposed crisscross room order clean floor i placed two small pieces popcorn middle large section flooring use markers cleaning efficiency course hour roomba passed markers many times sometimes closely without vacuuming time difficult detect much crisscrossing occurred since mouse like spent majority time periphery bumping spinning around walls furniture eventually break free walls set degree path picking one popcorn fragment one hour mark one hour ten minutes old adage pictures true i happened across minute time lapse photo roomba working room permission signaltheorist web site correlates well description actual paths i surveyed job afterwards floor definitely clean warning light machine saying dustbin full emptied contained impressive amount debris dust relative seemed visible naked eye another win robots well really interesting tool i continue use study comparison humans efficient point certainly autonomous despite guidance manual roomba still encounter unpredictable surfaces get trouble case pedestal recliner wood edge inch high reason machine recognize obstacle continued run base get hung loud spoken error message would sound advising human room pick start new place concern efficiency spent far much time perimeter low percentage time covering main floor areas tremendously inefficient took least times longer vacuum main rooms i would i pushing vacuum cleaner even though allows me things says something current state available affordable domestic robots ca match performance humans fairly basic task important concept futurists jump me luddite let me disclose details i member ieee past years i currently member ieee robotics automation society i electrical engineer i designed built robots hope start i retire psychiatry i consider myself expert human brain advantages confers humans animals machines roomba basic case point sense adapt novel conditions quickly enough match human task even striking although designed vacuum homes i fairly typical home better average floor surface still encounters situations exceed response capacity situations needs human assist human brain leads kind advantage first foremost rate pattern matching pattern completion capacity allows recognize vacuuming problems anticipate correct developing novel solutions even problem leads stop action happens human goes around room set first time roomba human made assessment machines capacities limitations problem solving machine turned observing limitation roomba leads me point i address idea computers replacing doctors fits common anti physician narrative country connection two experience tells me nearly years constant stream antiphysician rhetoric sources expected one key opinion leaders kols managed care industry i recall reading one first books written one non physician widely acclaimed expert managed care early theory high cost health care due decisions physicians make middle book wrote thought physician salaries grudgingly acknowledged probably paid good wage due education i posted many times experience managed care conference speakers conference clear explicit agenda industry replace specialists primary care physicians examples given orthopedic surgeons psychiatrists psychiatrist crowd pointed shortcomings philosophy called whiner governor anointed kol industry kols financial services industry started weighing could find glimpses reading investment literature people investors particular degree started saying day physicians would get deserve implication whatever good physician experienced prejudice comments physicians expensive rationalization working death hiring additional help replacing physicians computers seems like logical extension rhetoric googling topic returns number provocative articles written point view generally consistent author i know authors know difference robot computer doctor also clear certainly seem understand real processing power human diagnostician brain area pattern matching order duplicate property current technology takes massive computer one reasons new roomba although well designed easily beaten human standard vacuum cleaner human advantage goes far beyond human diagnosticians far match simple patterns able complete fragments patterns anticipate whole pattern example likely depressed person current state result inherited form depression current state detox opioid benzodiazepine current stressors interpersonal conflicts brain trauma undiagnosed medical condition childhood adversity psychological trauma adult defects reasoning either emotional cognitive levels matter acquiring data make determinations patterns upon patterns data roomba like approach would give person checklist depressive symptoms pretend needs known checklists already administered computer may administered robots someday yet takes pattern recognition several layers well human experience dependent learning order make real medical psychiatric diagnosis george dawson md dfapa supplementary graphic top post photo i shot inside box roomba came supplementary i want give false impression i lot vacuuming wife practically i trying especially high tech twist first robotics i hope work human controlled arms hands designed yard work move heavy objects around house i ca believe area ignored
