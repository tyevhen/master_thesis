made living writer years i like admit i devoted quite bit time thought writer block years strikes me quick brain dump subject might help others kind occasionally struggle process committing words paper electrons ther case may especially since i look others written writer block seems i come question writer block bit different direction others may may helpful people go far say writer block real total nonsense course writer block real tooth decay makes fascinating writer block parallel level seemingly ordinary daily activities eaters experience eater block walkers experience walker block writer block problem seems me two broad categories reasons anyone runs writer block let dignify capitalizing external reasons i worried xyz distracting me writing internal reasons i ca think opening sentence section paper discussion follows i going deal external blockers something psychiatrist internal blockers interest me hardest intrinsic process vast majority instances writer block traced two problems one fear committing verbal crimes nature aka perfectionism second inherent difficulty writing process worth elaborating maybe third main problem understanding whatever intend write fluid moving target ca see possibly start capturing words words still process making sense whatever writing feel nowhere near ready reduce static frozen immutable text legitimate concern second issue inherent difficulty writing process begin realize difficult writing process actually come realization silly beat absolutely beat blocked instead great sympathy attempting indeed sense heroic thing

lay major pieces collage intact way make sense overall job done first give permission take unusual entry points discussion give permission start middle end sometimes get good traction simply listing concluding points essential takeaways want able deliver write quickly entry points suggest another good heuristic find parts discussion mean emotionally begin working first need give good momentum write conviction find aspects subject resonate emotional level means harness important advice blocked always always give permission write crap always need give license write pure shit blocked writing utter crap better sitting staring blank page write junk come back later pretty make acceptable right need get moving time time may hear inner voices saying cruel things useless writing hopelessly bad never make dent futile ask authentic adult self talking child self inner child almost always deal would deal petulent child firmly politely say enough i heard enough need give child time go sit corner five minutes let inner child boss around right start make progress inevitably take frequent opportunities congratulate impossible heroic committing thoughts paper words wordspace reducing
