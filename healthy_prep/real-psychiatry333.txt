make decision talking colleagues many make similar decisions definitely linear process elements contact aggressive violent patients severe mental illnesses another recent post familiar scenario person paranoia severe personality disorder uses psychological defense projection projective identification popular vernacular person tends blame people problems even realistic connection happen psychiatrists unique aspects relationship nature treatment also happen physicians therapists counselors many cases blame projected onto anyone works organization clinic puts everyone danger including clerical staff significant substance use disorder usual scenario severe psychiatric disorder aggressive behavior substance use problem intoxicants disinhibiting potential activation increased paranoia increased psychosis impaired judgment also lead aggressive suicidal behavior occurs blackouts increases likelihood action threat makes contact patients context problematic includes crisis intervention centers emergency departments acute inpatient psychiatric facilities detox facilities crucial settings adequate staffing crisis plans contain aggression occurs ways limit access people weapons people control cases patients acute intoxication need rapidly sedated prevent self injury injury staff specific threat self family threat needs taken seriously also training point every mental health professional needs learn address issue first step make sure everyone workplace aware threat threat assessment needs done matched appropriate plan plans could range immediate call police emergency hospitalization civil commitment interventions clinic hospital interact person future police involvement debate gun rights nobody tells medical school homicidal patients occupational hazard nobody tells somebody threatens kill may hear scenarios television movies one themes typically well threats actually done anything yet ca anything common attitude law enforcement years ago i remember police department actually sending me fax patient threatening me purchased caliber handgun pawn shop left point absence action police result significant escalation threatening behavior person involved including threats firearm attitude problems also exist court level i testified hearing threats suggested occupational hazard psychiatrists therefore less relevant evidence criteria commitment nursing staff also subjected illogical attitudes assaults nurses commonly viewed occupational hazard administrative response generally responsible patient never prosecuted era civil commitment often watered point completely ineffective court ordered treatment criminal rather civil court may available treatment lot laws changed past two decades police able lot point recent cases telephone threats even indirect telephone threats police often make visit person making statements explain new laws terroristic threats mental health professional accept idea something beyond threat needs happen law enforcement get involved action necessary threat police actually frequently determining factor whether firearm acquired secure treatment environment many aspects dimension including access physical environment staffing security arrangements security cameras actually monitored security staff physical access environment limited staff inpatient psychiatric units locked i grateful many times locked door useful keeping people rather preventing patients leaving awareness psychiatrists staff killed aggressive patients happens frequently going long time tends make papers anymore old new york times article uncharacteristically blunt problem described full spectrum homicidal aggression toward psychiatrists back year i became intern i remember ever seeing article functional administration lack administrative support prioritizes treatment violence aggression associated systems approach violence prevention critical appearance single psychiatrist confrontation potentially violent aggressive perpetrator needs avoided costs staff splitting encourages patients aggressive wishes toward staff member need avoided costs may sound like common sense function years psychiatrist i never seen situation like handled appropriately administrators fact i seen opposite administrators dislike staff person suddenly rapid succession administrative staff patient problems focused person likely business oriented customer friendly approach patients promoted managed care potential making situations much worse hard imagine worse situation find potentially aggressive patient threatened taken seriously various patient representatives customer service representatives ombudsman many patients realize state medical board gold mine terms able continue harassment object aggression multiple complaints multiple parties filed even means egregious threats made patient included medical documentation sent medical board dynamic issues number critical issues related individual group psychodynamics i heard term therapeutic grandiosity used describe situation psychiatrist failed anticipate dangerous situation ended injured killed i think far likely psychiatrist involved recognize different conscious states patient fact one conscious states capable severe aggression many people seem confused legal definitions reduced capacity law believes rational internally consistent given psychotic state means person responsible actions every psychiatrist knows mood disordered psychotic states result decisions person would never made mental illness one decisions deciding whether become aggressive toward psychiatrist making determination depend subtle findings missed agreement meet issue especially hours clinician may find interacting unexpected person structure clinic schedule crisis plan clinic provide basic background making mistakes individual level possible view patient aggression personal failing part psychiatrist many psychiatrists assaulted full doubt missed whether care provided adequate easy lose sight fact physical aggression toward physician grossly inappropriate cases i personally aware psychiatrists spontaneously assaulted even interacting aggressive patient time many cases assaults occurred patients even know also interpersonal dynamics disquieting times staff speculating origins assault threats acting like aggressive behavior interpreted often occurs little knowledge patient unique characteristics cases assaultive behavior explained away psychological grounds person assaulted unsupported alienated rest staff experience dangerous position staff incredible twist aggressor seems support victim even victim sustained obvious injuries although studied would surprising find staff position would conclude support expect help need arm risk annihilation cultural hate psychiatrists doubt haters psychiatry influence always easier perpetrate violence minority group routinely vilified media seen stereotyped monolithic group people involved may difficulty distinguishing symbolic hate annihilation real thing factors come play considering whether arm oneself ward potentially homicidal threat psychiatrists i talked next decision threshold self defense carry weapon threshold front door security cameras alarm systems enough i knew psychiatrist carried rifle riding lawn mower critical factor comes threat assessment mitigating factors listed anyone second guessing psychiatrist position critical question becomes would i allow anyone kill me thought compelling enough ignore competing ethical considerations even though nothing medical ethics patient trying kill physician thought compelling enough ignore law order protect family threshold making kinds decisions people interested stopping kind aggression points considerations done stop cold long gunfire level analysis psychiatrists thinking carrying guns walking around really sign well outcome sign multiple systems society medicine either inconsistent failed corrupted systems place places work i seen every one work well point prevent aggression violence fixing larger problem benefit everyone including involved patients george dawson md dfapa
