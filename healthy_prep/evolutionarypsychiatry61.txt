i little far lately besides day job children weekly class natural disasters presenting almost every week seems spare time looking papers blogging sucked away i eager engage another bigger project instead posts single papers vein i hopeful pursue ocd lot work eating disorders stranger emailed me commented specific clinical issue i sorry i ca help right emailed me follow issue give me week two get back please presentations year least last one xavarian brothers high school disaster processed food brain i already invited two grand rounds spring paleofx physicians ancestral health get together february i invited also part proposed panel american psychiatric association diet psychiatry heard back apa whether accepted fingers crossed busy trying get word interesting intersections ancestral health pathology mental health real academics awesome research answer questions brahms symphony poco allegretto ad start sorry right click open new tab window mean time search vegetarian diets mood brought new free full text paper interesting nice review deficiency symptoms signs general young man vegetarian way essential vitamin medical school taught mainly neurologic hematologic blood findings severe deficiency particular kind nerve damage subacute combined degeneration spinal cord pretty much every board exam i ever took peripheral neuropathy cognitive problems reminiscent dementia enlargement numerical reduction red blood cells called megaloblastic anemia i know psychiatry residency psychiatric symptoms precede obvious medical findings psychiatric symptoms include irritability insomnia confusion negativism impaired attention folks deficiency diagnosed depression bipolar disorder panic disorder dementia even psychotic disorders vital making neurotransmitters methylation making dna deficiency cause sorts issues nerves caught early issues largely reversible serum test also reliable indicator available tissue level reason recommended patients depressive disorders i would broaden recommendation psychiatric patients occult deficiency masquerade many psychiatric disorders checked deficiency repleted level least ng ml normal range lab ranges i seen recommendation printed right bottom lab results lab i commonly use terribly controversial though many patients come level mid taught people deficiency problem absorption dietary deficiency test called schilling test determine malabsorption exists i never seen done practice though another common board exam question involves radioactive dose hour urine several stages i see typically done general practitioners try oral sublingual extra doses try prop levels normally works practice suggesting maybe consuming less think even non vegans help level low enough start shots bypass pesky gut often malabsorption due something obvious gastric bypass schilling test would probably waste time i also think easier check bacterial overgrowth non radioactive means days since bacterial overgrowth celiac condition typically cause gastronenterologists often pursuing diagnosis deficiency tend look causes oral repletion fails rather chase schilling test i think might enough background case study paper young turkish man age unusual since deficiencies thought elderly vegan presented one year complaints anxiety weepiness lethargy skipping school began stop sleeping eating withdrew friends spent lot time online buying things change young man extroverted active previous episodes compulsive buying obsessive behavior always trouble paying attention since least second grade described fidgety especially

genetic change may caused hematologic signs presenting great many neurologic signs also interesting presented called extrapyramidal symptoms postural problems rigidity similar parkinson disease doctors busy looking pesticide exposure antipsychotic use rather common neurologic problems deficiency peripheral neuropathy may also due genetic differences folate cycle machinery biochemists medical folks read last paragraph case presentation paper goes gory details possibilities respect cysteine folate dopamine motor neurons case fascinating rare presentation i would call relatively common vitamin deficiency i plan update previous post vegetarian diets mental disorders later today get work projects i best test patients deficiency least one time patient recurrent resistant depression along peripheral neuropathy symptoms low laboratory measure primary care doctor refused write order standard care shots period time megaloblastic anemia confusing phone call primary i decided go head order shots myself peripheral neuropathy symptoms resolved along insomnia agitation accompanied tough longstanding depression i still shake head one relatively low cost test inexpensive treatment possible dire permanent consequences left untreated i several paleo patients practice terrific levels usually i would say ng ml typical patient tends hover range strict daily multivitamin takers also
