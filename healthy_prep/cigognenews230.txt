years question always raised nature nurture causes much behavior many symptoms genes experience i vote i give edge would experience i getting ahead myself seems like genetics may experience vice versa due new field epigenetics experience modifies genes express blocked modified need look organic unit influencing perhaps lifetime certainly pure genetics color hair eyes comes plasticity malleability flexibility symptoms behavior need consider thing heart attacks fifties consider experience genetics never solve puzzle turns stress changes lymphocytes white blood cells increase happens extra cells stick artery walls slowing blood flow forms clots produces block blood vessels voila heart attack problem tend look current childhood stress real origin may womb life see new study may explain stress cause heart attacks nolan feeney health research june see ex time chronic stress heart attacks i noted stress life endangering potent stressful need take blinders look past experience deleterious experience obvious see fetus suffering mother smoking first inkling outside stress becomes inside heart attack happens stress de normalizes system either much little one lady i saw felt toxic one knew meant decided move desert feel non toxic feeling mother chain smoker toxic daughter carrying produced heavy toxicity became imprint remained system relived many times finally knew felt toxic much much i also want introduce important scientific paper meloni social brain meets reactive genome neuroscience epigenetics new social biology hypothesis theory may see journal frontiersin org journal fnhum abstract full text available free sums much new science epigenetics malleable less fixed might imagine heavily influenced genetic factors like humans genes need always considered context milieu interaction genes environment bring phenotype play often look phenotype see ignore origins cause problems behavior symptoms someone grows alcoholic violent environment understand causes delinquency growing inside womb heavy smoker help understand later breathing problems know look environment often womb life good part tease environmental factors sometimes reversed genes therapists need pay attention latest research birth practices pediatric discoveries i often write simple fact respond environment lead discover proper origins i hasten add respond forcefully environment becomes earlier grow children environment passed hereditary chain short happens lives visited upon offspring always bad stuff also good mother rats often licked offspring healthy offspring baby offspring well michael meaney work well moshe szyf noted primal position well critical periods life environment affects clearly first weeks life life planet life inside mother ship i writing mostly methylation environment becomes embedded cells nurture becomes nature i mean life experience affects offspring acts like genetics yes i mean outside become inside animal studies find methylation patterns critical period engraved parts limbic feeling centers i hippocampus patterns become stable enduring mean vulnerable later disease say modifications methylation patterns imprint encoded form long term outcomes briefly imprints make sick abuse seems change methylation patterns especially critical period important heavy methylation feeling centers ultimately lead mental illness becomes crucial bad mental reactions imprint altered hippocampus way make one vulnerable trauma imprint fixed enduring form cellular memory according meaney syzf meloni researches i come conclusion imprint endure lifetime fused difficult pry nature away nurture effect become one fetus infant stressed expression genes change regulated toward expression regulated toward repression lot depends chemicals borrowed embed event memory acetyl group methyl group investigators finding surprise licked loved infant animal babies far better handling later stress vice versa babies loved harder time handling stress adversity i mean love important yes wonder rate lost productivity jobs due form mental illness early stress leaves offspring less adventurous much cautious wary susceptible drug addiction imprinted pain booga booga addiction centers miss early causes way cure addiction i said numerous times love addiction neurosis away point adverse early events leave mark trace imprint endures affects behavior symptoms late love yes helps bit brushing imprint useless pain gates yield feelings let human beings social brains take outside life transform lots internal stuff look phenotype say aha genetic worse say job causing much stress rarely either born got last week like high blood pressure example primal pain kills prematurely much diet although i would neglect diet normal people generally choose healthy diets according number studies system balanced food choices choices life example like proper partner vapors concrete experience experience usually predates life birth name recent book need look find causes find key memories driven caused many symptoms mystery find cure
