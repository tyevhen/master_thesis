frippery last two posts hefty new year analysis community treatment orders complete references tasty statistics forget put me references amhp trainees mental health introduced new role amhp functions relating new powers community treatment orders functions agree making community treatment order cto extension cto sa conditions included cto sb revocation ctosf mental health new roles nimhe october previously nearest equivalent relating aftercare supervision inserted mha intended provide legal framework ensure patients detained could treated community however never really legal teeth enforce essentially patient agree imposition aftercare supervision disagreed order could made would discharged anyway well enough even agree could change mind time much could practically done i ever involved one discharge patient hospital several years willingly agreed comprehensive plan aftercare predischarge meetings however instant formally discharged changed mind within fortnight stopped medication began hide care coordinator two weeks later turned parents house middle night beside fear everyone charwood listening thoughts tv cia tracker drones scanning every move within month back hospital never really caught community treatment orders however something different also quite controversial since various human rights organisations concerns proposed powers could compel patients treatment community pain recalled hospital refused certainly ethical issues cto ever right force people detained hospital take medication alternative stated purpose cto allow suitable patients safely treated community rather detention hospital provide way help prevent relapse harm patient others might cause intended help patients maintain stable mental health outside hospital promote recovery mha code practice sounds pretty good addition power designed used severely mentally disordered people high risk relapse often referred revolving door patients people like jenny i wrote july god told me answer door repeatedly admitted hospital often mha frequent relapses admissions person may take many months hospital recover likely far harmful quality life imposition controls may actually allow function normally live fulfilled life homes odd thing though cto role amhp whole process asw amhp predecessors specific extensive powers relation detention patients mha i often described blog asw amhp power responsibility arrange detention admission mentally disordered patient doctors recommend asw amhp makes final decision takes consequences decision asw amhp acting independently local authority approves despite opinions patients amhp enjoy exerting power reality onerous stressful task never taken lightly cto put amhp position merely recommending endorsing decision responsible clinician rc psychiatrist charge patient role although essential legal process comparatively minor practice consists little signing brief preprinted statement piece paper amhp becomes involved cto process three ways case making cto first place amhp presented form cto already largely filled rc amhp sign agrees patient meets legal criteria cto appropriate conditions rc made necessary appropriate case extension cto beyond initial months cto amhp agree patient meets criteria extension appropriate patient recalled hospital rc powers cto appears need remain hospital hours rc reinvoke original revoking cto amhp simply agree form cto patient meets criteria detention hospital appropriate revoke cto however funny thing cto remarkable lack rules guidance relating discharge amhp role amhp subject sorts requirements relating detention patients laid either guidance form reference guide code practice include interview patient suitable manner making decision correct identification nearest relative notifying patient nearest relative rights write detailed report explaining justifying decisions ensuring legal requirements met failure things may lead accusations amhp acted bad faith even illegally comes cto requirement write report unless disagree psychiatrist department health guidance published states making judgements amhp expected bring knowledge patient social situation discussion may require discussion patient care co ordinator key worker information patient home family informal support networks cultural background form part decisions taken sct supervised community treatment guide practitioners dh sep actual requirement even interview patient consult nearest relative also seems guidance would constitute grounds disagree consultant view somehow feel right although cto force since end months ago i actually called upon discharge amhp functions i signed cto making cto cto revoking cto makes me expert course although i sure many amhp two years new powers involved plenty cto especially hospital based therefore easily pop corridor fill form came something surprise me suddenly exercising new function i consulted colleagues go making assessment decision i fully realised lack guidance procedural protocols amhp even involved many cto seemed somehow uncomfortable whole process approaching task ways much dark i first request i received cto year old girl hospital year put me outside comfort zone day day work i work adults diagnosis bipolar affective disorder made me even uncomfortable always belief usual age onset bipolar affective disorder somewhere mid mid could child therefore even receive diagnosis child adolescent psychiatry even mysterious i thought however role amhp question diagnosis i simply decide whether agree patient responsible clinician patient meets criteria sct whether sct appropriate mha code practice i also consider wider social context patient relevant factors may include support networks patient may potential impact rest patient family employment issues amhp consider patient social cultural background may influence family environment living support structures potentially available code practice i consulted hospital rc actually making cto well community rc would managing cto i spoke care coordinator i interviewed patient home leave charwood mother i read girl psychiatric notes i wrote report simply using headings factors taken account hospital rc posted cto me i going drive miles fill form i received i filled part posted back received couple days later completed became subject supervised community treatment end involvement although i suppose i may called involved renewal process first months piece work i far done revocation cto following recall hospital related leroy i wrote blog may leroy cto year christmas day found naked police charwood town centre stopping cars kissing windows ill advised use amphetamine believed implicated informally admitted bluebell ward clear despite amphetamine wearing unwell would need remain hospital hours i felt comfortable i knew leroy well i knew relapse signature seemed likely would appropriate remain hospital treatment also seemed cto seemed positive effect months since subject supervised community treatment acute admissions hospital gone bit length time spent hospital also reduced i interviewed wrote report signed bit cto one thing leaves me feeling little uncomfortable cto popular often takes quite mental health professionals get used legal changes like cto document published october patients formally detained hospitals mental health patients subject supervised community treatment annual figures england total number patients placed cto virtually doubled period number patients detained people detained forensic sections placed cto completely static means within two years introduction cto nearly patients detained hospital discharged cto since cto often kept place year could mean growing accumulation patient community cto may take convincing constitutes least restrictive option
