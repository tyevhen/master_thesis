first zombieland movie trailer fun take peek one popular posts zombieland brilliant psychiatrist friend mine described food thought post phospholipids primarily phosphatidylserine phosphatidylcholine delectable important nutrients nature supplied richly consumption brains though eggs perhaps palatable source linus pauling institute article choline hey nephropal back sorry jump around i spent good part morning playing video games attention span shot though reaction times awesome little i know choline would become fashionable nutrient paleoblogosphere chris masterjohn paul jaminet stephan guyenet post three everyone anyone doubled egg consumption thereafter much focused fatty liver disease one really must eat choline protect one liver rigors modern life turns liver front lines brain battle really rages data humans scarce small human trials induced choline deficinecy fatty liver reversed choline repletion let throw epidemiology mice rats speculation first choline part folate cycle i discussed bit post folate cycle exceptionally important liver brain nerve health includes key players iron vitamin vitamin folate methionine choline oxidized choline called betaine sam niacin riboflavin players need field full folate cycle run efficiently choline absorbed humans immediately made phosphatidylcholine incorporated cell membranes choline also made betaine liver serves methyl donor many important chemical reactions one phosphorylated products many reactions phosphocreatine way also important neurons brain sphingomyelin problems deficiencies folate cycle including choline deficiency implicated fatty liver disease neural tube defects like spina bifida cardiovascular disease cancer cycle begins methionine amino acid using various vitamin cofactors made sam sam methyl donor vital nearly sixty important chemical reactions liver making neurotransmitters cell membranes dna used methyl donor sam becomes sah becomes homocysteine high homocysteine associated dementia cardiovascular disease mind associated poor nutrition general without players homocysteine hard time recycled use folate cycle order get majority players need eat lot whole grains vitamins organ meats eggs whole grains issues i stick latter sources thank much right choline necessary fatty liver develops need choline make vldl particles vldl carries triglycerides liver bloodstream enough phospholipids like phosphatidylcholine form coat vldl particle end triglycerides stuck liver fatty liver enough phospholipids even get triglycerides liver could possibly enough use cell membranes neurons brain especially rich phospholipids would even get without cholesterol fat carrying particles fatty liver harbinger even serious problems follow neural tube defects extremely common birth defects result faulty closing ends neural tube early development humans spend time sort flat like elongated pancake roll couple ways become wormlike grow limb buds sorts interesting things become babies rolling properly requires folate cycle running full efficiency sure enough epidemiologic studies linked choline deficiency human mothers neural tube defects offspring bottom choline intake times risk babies neural tube defects top mice choline restriction shown cause neural defects pregnancy lactation periods woman life needs serious choline keep machinery going placental amniotic fluid levels choline nearly times mother serum levels moms seem benefit enhanced choline making machinery pregnancy mom still ends depleted levels childbirth continue lactation best time replete vital nutrient kiddos beyond neural tube defect issue memory issue neural tube defects usually begin within first month pregnancy time realize expecting pretty much late anything studies rats shown choline depleted mothers latter half rat pregnancy results offspring lousy memories hippocampus part brain epicenter memory depression pregnant rats plenty choline seem able make membranes dna stem cells need make awesome hippocampus pregnant rats without choline baby rats remember well addition choline supplementation second half pregnancy seems protect offspring rats detrimental brain effects alcohol given mothers studies humans showing link however elevated human maternal homocysteine levels linked preeclampsia prematurity low birth weight studies shown higher mother choline levels lower homocysteine tends studies including nurses health study framingham offspring study shown higher choline levels associated lower inflammatory markers many kinds including il tnf alpha reactive protein keep mind prospect epic study even women highest quartile choline intake fell institutes medicine number adequate intake mg day women get amount need eat half pound chicken two eggs quart milk sure anyone would drinking okay relatively rich sources nurses health study women fell average daily intake mg addition nearly seem genetic polymorphism hard time making methionine choline meaning choline becomes even essential nutrient fact may people bulletproof livers others develop fatty liver looking bottle wine women adequate intake large studies higher average intake eggs i wonder choline reason recent studies shown eggs conjunction calorie restricted diet seem improve diabetes despite fat cholesterol i like studies seem annihilate lipotoxicity hypothesis i find information choline convincing i eat eggs breakfast week kids perinatal period baby rats brain development benefits increased choline consumption extrapolated years old humans eat eggs offal especially rugrat plan rugrats time soon
