etienne esquirol one innovators modern classification philosophical approaches subsequent dsms reviewed generally correlate theories day development dsm began original goals included definition mental illness dimensional criteria addressing mental illness across lifespan possibly address mental disorders affected various contexts sex culture darrel regier md recruited nimh coordinate development dsm year international conferences researchers wrote specific diagnostic issues developed research agenda produced scientific papers compiled use reference volumes far i tell people ground issue dsm

addiction psychiatry elimination categories substance abuse substance dependence collapsing substance use disorder panic attacks used symptom another disorder without specify person panic disorder pattern i observed course career controversial personality disorders section unchanged hybrid diagnostic system includes dimensional symptoms details i think appendix mapped onto diagnostic classification criteria changes number subtypes specifiers well number ways specify diagnostic certainty previous editions since dsm iii mental disorder definition indicates behavior criteria enough must functional impairment distress definition specifies socially deviant behavior conflicts individual society constitute mental illness unless actual source conflict overall impression end lectures massive year effort apa hundreds possibly thousands volunteer psychiatrists psychologists none volunteers financial stake final product many criticisms addressed process many critics financial stake dsm criticism industry criticisms dsm seem trivial compared process built safeguards dsm also designed updated online instead waiting another massive effort start make modifications hence dsm dsm dr
