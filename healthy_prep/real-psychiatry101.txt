end point severe alcohol addiction many people self professed black drunks preferred endpoint acute intoxication goal subsequent drinking sessions states highly reinforcing susceptible people probably explain greater expected occurrence alcohol related disorders following rygb surgery looking prevalence alcohol use disorder aud rygb surgery mitchell et al found aud within year post op period including prior history aud including permissive screening tool number increased respectively previous study showed prevalence aud symptoms greater year post gastric bypass surgery associated number preoperative variables including rygb male sex smoking regular alcohol consumption procedure studies look prevalence alcohol use interesting perspective addiction psychiatrist sees patients selected addiction observing effect scale significant example patients i see problem predominantly women practically alcohol use problem prior surgery many cases drink alcohol practically undergone rygb also
