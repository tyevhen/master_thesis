i think may general election coming soon got me thinking even usual political parties manifestos policies feel sure make country better place trouble policies based ideologies reflect reality life country take account long term consequences policies blunt governments political parties continually fail grasp basics joined planning managing society whole thought setting fixed five year term office would obviated political need short term policy facilitated longer term rational planning politician i suppose i hopelessly na think one thing major parties seem common belief necessary make cutbacks public spending none stand back take long hard look would actually happen cutbacks implemented big society like fat lady corset try squeezing one place happen bulge another place whole remains fact squeezing much might simply end asphyxiating body trying manage i going make ideological argument based airy fairy social work concepts social equity fairness i simply going try show

example government appears regard home ownership innately good desirable thing end current conservative party manifesto says extend right buy people living housing association homes another way looking policy government gives money either directly via local authorities housing associations order build houses people income ability buy houses government sells houses large discount people probably able afford buy home case government makes immediate loss investment people buy houses may quite possibly decide sell order realise considerable profit return government stamp duty people buy houses let privately larger rents housing associations charging owned social housing sold without necessary investment replace shortage rented housing pushes rents privately owned properties people renting properties whether hard working families low incomes unable work age disability claim housing benefit cover increases government costs housing benefit increase policy costs government twice still solved underlying problem national shortage housing continues drive value houses makes even harder hard working people afford buy first place policy allowing people withdraw spend pension funds government makes initial killing taxing money withdrawn significant number pensioners use money buy property order let increased demand property inflates house prices makes housing even less affordable driving demand renting increased demand private rented property inflates rents leads increase people claims housing benefit costs government money let forget years future people drew money pension funds spent making claims welfare benefits system form housing benefit pension tax credit costs government even money policy known annoyance coalition government bedroom tax well continue cost housing associations money lost revenue people able afford higher rent fall arrears housing associations incur expense taking court evict housing associations generally funded central local government grants vulnerable homeless people accommodated local authorities people may end privately rented houses previously belonged housing associations sold inflated rents claim higher rates housing benefit would claiming bedroom tax introduced one final example close heart cuts funding mental health services despite coalition claims funding nhs increased reality according andy mcnicoll excellent report community care cut real terms funding mental health trusts community mental health teams cut despite increase referrals time cuts community services psychiatric beds reduced since period recession one inevitable consequences high unemployment low wages increase mental ill health trusts attempted save money closing hospital beds understaffing community services meant people could less efficiently managed community leading increase demand available beds increase requests assessments mental health led increase use leave beds beds nominally occupied patient leave part discharge care planning wards increased pressure discharge early consequence people likely relapse need acute bed inexorable pressure beds led increased use beds trust areas trusts frequently use private hospitals beds far expensive house beds also increased costs transporting patients long distances often use private ambulance service local ambulance trusts would refuse provide transport holes service provision crisis intervention also leads increased use police emergency powers associated delays completing assessment delays finding bed puts increased pressure police time resources course huge cuts funding local authorities among things responsible providing police services policing levels cut time another consequence cuts local authorities funding services effect providing alternatives hospital admission respite care reducing demand mental health services support services personal budgets vulnerable service users also cut adding even pressure nhs mental health services i said beginning squeeze much
