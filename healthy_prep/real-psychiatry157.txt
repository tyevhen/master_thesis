years whenever i thought ideal way practice medicine ophthalmology comes mind i remember good friend mine telling me shortly became ophthalmologist speciality seemed ideal mix medical surgical interventions mostly effective also great observation matter field medicine specialize information field generally contained two three large volume texts information always expands amount specialization friend bright guy like specialties i fair share personal contact starting bb gun injury th grade right like movie i almost shot eye like movie father told me shortly accident careful bb gun shoot eye within minutes i standing disbelief bb ricocheted steel lamp cover basement instantaneously hit me left eye within minutes i looked mirror shocked discover iris color replaced blood inside anterior chamber eye family doctor called advised parents bring me office emergency room see new ophthalmologist town physician town could assess treat injury i spent week hospital eyes covered eventually recovered traumatic cataract lens left eye every ophthalmologist since said thing lucky cataract visual axis affect vision even interesting last ophthalmologist i saw wanted know experience seeing traumatic cataract visual axis ways seem different eye many questions finally said i trying find like cataract ophthalmologist interested conscious state vision useful lessons ophthalmology precise assessments based clear markers still room interpretation two retinas alike another example eye doctor told me recently prominent retinal arteries may put risk glaucoma i saw second eye doctor weeks later agreed i may subgroup people prominent retinal arteries put me higher risk glaucoma years annual eye exams intraocular pressures always normal i also used eye exam lectures diagnostic accuracy looking issue diagnostic accuracy direct ophthalmoscopy versus indirect ophthalmoscopy basically ophthalmologists versus everyone else ophthalmologists win wide margin comes detecting retinal pathology odds primary care physician detect changes direct ophthalmoscopy screening exam greater chance days i lot direct physical examinations patients i convinced physicians either poor job using ophthalmoscope focusing major landmarks also seemed ignore general clinical status patient i recall agitated hypertensive young stroke patient clear hemorrhages retina i diagnosed retinal hemorrhages nobody else could confirm i told look like medicine subjective factor even appear objective assessments ophthalmology seems greatest potential accuracy reproducibility interventions fast safe effective years ago i interviewing patient looked wood grain table started swirl move one visual field i part big multidisciplinary clinic time information flow among specialists best i ever seen i called ophthalmology clinic spoke ophthalmologist seconds symptoms said retinal migraine get afternoon i doubt much else i went advice similar problems since years ago family member called me saturday morning said sudden onset veiled vision floaters lives town people able see retinal specialist get laser surgery torn retina matter hours i three relatives retinal surgery successful case one month ago i sudden onset eye aching massive floaters large bright halos surrounding entire visual field left eye i triaged ophthalmology hours diagnosed acute vitreous detachment plan observe retinal damage two weeks interventions clearly enhance quality life saving someone vision needs top anyone list comes quality life surgical specialties generally active intervention physician good outcomes complications i seen complication rates eye procedures low cases advertised procedures done excess many cases expectation seeing doctor times chances good outcome improve life high clear path getting well majority patients seeing ophthalmologists much get well recognize problem discuss treatment plan risks benefits surgical procedure make follow appointments case medical treatment use required eye drops visual aids diet protective equipment participate monitoring plan patients i see eye problems i know many follow i routinely ask personal history eye trauma visual problems glaucoma macular degeneration cases i call ophthalmologist directly whether medication i prescribe would affect treatment generally optimal path care good outcome outlined form ophthalmology patients burden adherence relatively low contrast patient walking psychiatric clinic i mean patient gets direct appointment psychiatrist precision assessment diagnostic manual gives appearance precision fairly worthless unless physician knows get generally involves seen many patients problem also involves concluding many dsm categories nonspecific unrealistic makes sense make diagnosis diagnostic manual imprecise markers sorely needed i optimistic verge i optimistic correct markers able define categories clearly define treatment paradigms categories i expect resemble dsm rdoc matter burden adherence much higher polypharmacy keeping medications straight certainly big problem primary care medical specialties nobody else wants see people back hourly basis weeks months years one fastest safest interventions psychiatry electroconvulsive therapy many parts country unavailable fda continuous program afoot reclassify second iteration program since i responded first one years ago logical conclusion kind political maneuver played regulatory context understanding reclassification would mean new sets clinical trials get fda approval devices surprising places offer thousands patients go endless clinical trials antidepressants remission symptoms tms transcranial magnetic stimulation vns vagal nerve stimulation seem far less impressive treatment resistant populations last week colleague also pointed probably thousands patients might benefit ketamine infusions seems another procedure limbo pending fda considerations without fda approval health insurers deem treatment experiment pay treatment usually grinds halt quality life considerations high psychiatrists agenda since learned treat conditions listed top world health organizations list disabling conditions unless get robust treatment responses quality life likely improve vast numbers patients disabled maintained medications clearly need medication service offered health plan series brief visits psychiatrist prescriber generally focused polypharmacy attempt cognitive vocational rehabilitation services available stroke patients psychiatric patients path getting well recovering mental illness addiction often clear message oversimplified take medications prescribed patient may hear drugs alcohol typically problem identified average person addiction according survey literature disclose physician people acute episode mood disorder psychosis know start know happened know prevent happening may hear need therapy counseling realize sessions like therapist sessions going anywhere left point go back see prescriber minute lots medications seem hardly effect seemingly endless series medication trials instead parsing words somewhat meaningful categories need pick pace experience people willing see psychiatrists long period time pharmacotherapy psychotherapy minority clear many psychiatrists end seeing patients three four times year appears interminable treatment patients varying degrees disability problematic quality life care delivered ophthalmologists addressing impressive array eye diseases injuries previously noted psychiatrists also addressing lot illness disease like previous argument orthopedic surgeons i never heard shortage ophthalmologists ophthalmology teaches much better way designing paths care instead giving business people politicians critical question idea shortage psychiatrists much due inefficiencies suggested including interference politicians business organizations george dawson md dfapa
