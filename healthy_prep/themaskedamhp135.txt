clustering i year experience clustering service users charwood community mental health team i based i also training far become clear difficult use assessment tool sort meaningful way point clustering apparently assign service users care treatment package best meets identified needs however unless care packages known almost impossible know cluster assign specific individual care packages yet defined training course admitted bit like one tv cookery competitions given pile ingredients without told dish supposed preparing i apologise post appeared little dry boring far imagine like mental health professionals trying apply clustering assessments unfortunately even though inserting sharp objects one rectum might appear preferable pastime using mental health clustering tool compulsory requirement also profound effect funding mental health trusts course clustering really actually little actually trying identify needs service users providing care treatment according needs old unfashionable needs led approach years ago charwood cmht first created team spent considerable time trying identify cmht course try meet needs people severe enduring mental health problems well acute
