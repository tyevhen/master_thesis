i hope i drowning fish i want explore nature feeling judge whether feeling individuals matter access feeling means access good part access means health means less repression less unconscious forces nudging inside let go back basic points first traumas occur womb set many ways many brain structures also seem set certain wave length frequency hypothesis proven science science traumas i discuss nearly always deprivation need needs appear according genetic plan change transform needs first biologic next emotional finally intellectual correspond scheme evolution brain primitive brainstem limbic prefrontal cortex heaviest pain instinctual biologic early needs mean life death proper nutrition carrying mother smoking drinking drugs anxiety often hard avoid subtly really wanting baby brain grows new traumas build evolve elaborated first memory pain noxious stimuli wish enlarge frequency base original imprint compounded deprivation emotional need held caressed looked talked necessarily life death matter emotional deprivation rob humanity add similar kinds pain say constant parental rejection indifference get deeper pain i believe joins frequency parade intensifies new pains compounding original pains laid near start life womb similar pains join together add imprinted frequency set start life i believe one way recognize old friends band together seems pain pain system much distinguish among spurs action hold repress brain seem care believe long beliefs suppress feeling deprivation need continues compounds reaches areas brain including cognitive understanding pain brain committed repression brain becomes pain dealing engine see morpugo spinelli work happens feeling centers may send types pain thalamus switchboard brain forwarding frontal brain helps understand feelings much pain rerouted lower brain centers unconscious creates havoc physiologic symptoms pain always knocking door frontal cortex trying connect resolve thing let relax connection gates pain let happen unless gates weaken constant deprivation neglect flood enters overwhelms thinking cortex scattering cohesion interrupting concentration producing strange ideas uncalled suspicions makes gates weaken much additional load pain forget gates always trying keep pain away conscious awareness talk synapses transmitters details overarching reality block pain function stop functioning may spend lifetime trying fulfill needs touched sexual outs one example may overeat based starvation proper nutrients womb drinking kill pain basic drives overeat drink drug often mean attempt quell first line physiologic trauma deprivation life sustaining input first line means basic drives first line trauma womb birth provokes first line symptoms first line attempts repress feeding body sort pain killer many alcoholics told me drinking relaxes gives feeling warmth never one takes drugs continually pain would drink drugs would stick serving great biologic purpose need understand neurosis heavy load painthey serve purpose obvious help get life even function normals function well drugs neurotics pain dislocates biologic system attempting fulfill need basic makes therapy treatment feeble response course considered disease refractory difficult treat early start armed theory womb life infancy life never understand attempts fulfillment i call symbolic trying fulfill need early later attempts pale course person goes trying fulfill need must never gives body give effort hold goodhearted step programs deprive even deprive attempt fulfillment even symbolic least attempt feeling feeling need pain comes deprivation i know stop drinking feeling come help becomes feeling less need symbolic fulfillment make sense pain pain killing efforts pain pain killing efforts done day direction always right feeling means blockage parts means access directions including deep physiological i seen patients interest eating nothing gives pleasure recapture feelings recapture taste joy unconscious constantly moving upward forward attempt connection integration trying whole deeper pain earlier occurred stronger force memory battles defense system provokes thinking brain action sometimes person needs thinking brain help hence cognitive insight therapy joint thought combination therapist patient helps push feelings lifelong affair seen measured patients whose brainwaves extremely fast even get close feeling able slow get feeling primal zone either feeling compounded aspects feelings taking painkillers tranquilizers push back force feeling seems like individuals brain racing away feeling fast thoughts going going seem stop part traumatic memory lies group busy neurons working join likely neurons coalesce feeling liberating smell mothers perfume see earrings wearing look father face cloudy day etc i treated one young man remembers kind scene could smell perfume saw earrings clearly told mother memory surprised accuracy memory lost earrings patient four years old elements memory deeper profound feeling i remember i crying crib daddy came angry eyes shouted me shut whole memory came back patient felt many later less painful memories start lifelong fear father authoritarian men general afraid contradict boss work fear worked became anxious presence never knew pieces memory come together feeling say hopeless helplessness person getting back self barricaded behind repressive gates i noticed two feelings behind much early misery patients theorize basic feelings i seen hopelessness helplessness often feeling death harm offing nothing person strangling cord birth example mother smokes carrying lifelong consequences early trauma say depression time lead cancer mean repressed feelings involved depression also involved development cancer two distinct maladies primal sense different manifestations cause find medicine disease treating finding many avenues treat person say high blood pressure recognize key fact pain repression lifelong unending task patient fully plugged complete feeling starts present goes back childhood birth full access generally come back route back childhood present i call three two one event trip back two three i mean access often patients blocked route backwards defenses setup time keep memories completely disrupting consciousness come hold back deeper aspects feeling know patient enough often therapist stake producing deep feelings patient look good patient pushed beyond ability suffer know primal dramatic event able produce patient seems make therapist seem omniscient omnipotent someone need like making baby talk ready parent look good smart baby incidentally i discussed biologic critical window time needs must fulfilled small aside child allowed go fulfilling need ended timetable may find neurotic result child goes nursing long due mother need becomes imprinted becomes fixated breasts sucking slight interruption i want say feeling means experience means aspects psychological physiological neuronal join make feeling cure someone pain repression need experience mental exercise bereft emotions stored brain almost full access feeling fully loved great traumas early life never come switchboard brain seems thalamus strategically positioned inform prefrontal area feeling imagine operator constantly plugging aspects memory context feeling lonely alone brain operator unplugging emotional aspects memory valance storing future plugging certain aspects feeling unplugging emotional component need plug emotions feelings back lock frequency three levels brain function joined whole feeling means experiencing pain three levels instinctual physiologic emotional feeling intellectual comprehension feeling bodily dimensions meets feelings intellectual overview putting together remember details early lives plugged emotions others permanently plugged emotions little cerebral counterpart awash pain remains unconnected normally overall feeling gathers disparate aspects binds whole i call feeling still aspects memory reachable first line brainstem base feel get well need stay frequency memory parts experienced integrated psychoanalysis someone remember every little detail early life bereft emotional component access feeling largely take care special techniques therapist necessary try force feeling decide know patient needs go failure looms i teach therapist never never claim know patient means says i feel lonely i feel afraid etc specific feelings underlying sentences patient feelings knows sentence may linked right birth touched held age one mother died age four i sent preschool etc think know patient feeling means know details life exactly meant phrase i feel lonely think know exactly patient go session try lead cure make notes head need follow patient lead help someone feel course need entrance feeling centers amygdala hippocampus finally prefrontal cortex bind separate elements emotional whole enough watch patient cry cry think done good crying must context needs connection aspects must linked together linked neuronal rhythms brain otherwise abreactive discharge releases energy feeling without essence person running energy portion feeling without knowing really still moment relief patient thinks getting somewhere going nowhere literally measured vital signs feeling abreaction feeling vitals move coordinated fashion ending near beginning baseline abreaction sporadic vitals moving jigsaw fashion going baseline elements joined specific oscillations neurons way health problem patient repressed suffers affliction go treating elements feeling manifestations grinding stomach shortness breath ignore whole organizing principle feeling omit repressed feelings give rise symptoms omit humanity person
