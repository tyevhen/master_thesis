psychiatry one specialties allowed use active thyroid hormone instead safer prohormone treatment resistant depression please see yesterday post thyroid primer literature use extensive old much done reliable lab tests thryoid function symptoms pulse insomnia anxiety palpitations reflexes measured judge whether someone made hyperthyroid treatment i suppose made bolder back day also options medication speaking people studying resistant depression little study reason ton data lithium bipolar disorder game town decades event i thought i would take opportunity catch latest greatest supplementation safety issues particularly since large star trial used found equally efficacious resistant depression lithium use better many pharmaceutical tinctures fortunately date review green journal augmentation major depressive disorder safety considerations article number interesting points particularly regards standard endocrinology method treating hypothyroidism monotherapy i get bit right weakness studies short typically weeks also studies augmentation acceleration old fashioned antidepressants tricyclics tcas i think tricyclics i think cruder much medication stringent time tcas lots side effects weight gain dry mouth fast heartbeat fatal overdose however effective many folks serious depression nonfunctional suicidal responded medicine would take without proved worse side effects ssris fewer still insignificant side effects yet invented mildly depressed women still given shots primary care doctors also advised smoke give energy motivation gave tiny bit dexedrine morning barbituates night dealing subset depressed people respond tricyclics seem hypothyroid physical symptoms lab tests time certain percentage would respond augmentation active thyroid hormone addition accelerating tricyclics like antidepressants take several weeks kick dose front isolated weeks discontinued seemed work fewer studies augmentation ssris also short results less definitive would help central nervous system well lot thyroid fingers almost every physiological pie may direct neurotransmitter also seems increase efficiency serotonin signaling much like modern ssri also enhances neurogenesis central nervous system could also enhance noradrenergic signaling conversion occurs body central nervous system uses different active genes periphery occurs within cells differences could explain clinical observations augmentation seems work best folks already diagnosed hypothyroid monotherapy literature seems support observation i ignoring selenium iodine deficiency moment literature much north america fairly selenium rich soil except eastern coastal plain given wide geographic distribution vegetables produce frank selenium deficiency rare also advent iodized salt frank iodine deficiency also rare babies rarely born congenital hypothyroidism facts mean selenium iodine levels optimized i would say frank deficiency rare good news augmentation seems help relying limited longer term data several years seems relatively safe particularly short term though post menopausal women need watch possible side effect osteoporosis continued risk heart arrhythmia heart healthy strong boned folks serious bout depression small dose good option even clinically laboratory measure euthyroid normal thyroid particularly type serious episodes bounce back rather chronically low grade depressed people goal longer term treatment use dose keeps tsh low end normal even somewhat normal hyperthyroid symptoms free high end normal i tell recommended dose mcg almost always seems overshoot goal probably reflects long history shorter term studies monitoring bone density cardiac side effects frequently particularly post menopausal women augmentation seem work better folks higher tsh lower free ts baseline suggesting indeed treating type subclinical hypothyroidism depression symptoms maybe convert fine periphery poor converters central nervous system would support clinical observation long term treatment fairly useless euthyroid except temporary severe exacerbations useful hypothyroid subclinical hypothyroid endocrinologists combination therapy hypothyroidism i tell me point blank phone literature support treatment hypothyroidism anything monotherapy i pull psychiatric indication card back mostly folks medicine little scared psychiatrists psychiatric patients little bit literature psychiatrists last shamans western medicine typically wear white coats treat unexplained exist apart may well witch doctors insurance payments regard mental health medical separate entities i wandering bit well literature combination therapy vs monotherapy alone hypothyroidism multiple studies meta analysis proven benefit combination therapy alone however several studies patients preference combination therapy could explained lab results quality life measurements denmark one study using double blind crossover methods treated patients alone equivalent tsh levels patients preferred combination therapy compared preferred monotherapy quality life measures depression anxiety ratings generally better combination therapy alone monotherapy safer less likely result hyperthyroidism say support alternative incorrect evolutionary point view general bit seaweed selenium wo hurt case hashimoto one must take care iodine supplementation lest one worsen condition seems less likely happen selenium topped selenium excess also pretty bad idea looking modern basis hypothyroid depression treatment science behind monotherapy yet ironclad might yet come back banishment psychiatry
