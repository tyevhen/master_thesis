i like reading health care blog typifies wrong management american health care system i suppose blogs general steady stream bad ideas political rhetoric best recent example little piece radiologists called watson replace radiologist ask radiologist radiologists either read blog ca bothered since comment point rheumatologist necessary consultation collegiality radiologists author main article taking perspective threatening ibm watson machine acquire image reading capabilities human radiologist reading large set clinical images reading much faster rate radiologist advising way radiology survive demonstrate value patients colleagues connecting author conclusion explicit connect replaced past thirty years experience radiologists positive cases outstanding dates back early days medical student intern responsible carrying stack heavy awkward films around i remember film cardiology rotation regretting mr dawson made think good idea chest ray patient mitral valve disease point radiologists friends era lot managed care penetration i always rotated public hospitals va hospitals anyway could always find radiologist back dark confines reading room interns residents certain staff members go staff terms teaching also amazing observations always pointed missing collected teaching files teaching cases learn reading rooms could bizarre places days large films clamped reading boxes cases entire rows films wide could rotated belt device radiologist would need recall saw film press foot pedal correct film popped many days row row films would need surveyed find one wanted early days spinal ct many films viewed patient i forget positive experiences resident i became attending physician images i ordered patients seen i would still go pull films necessary review radiologist i neuroradiologists work excellent medium changing eventually films went away i went radiology reading room still computer terminal two monitors images could immediately manipulated show best view longer necessary pull film cassette illuminate bright light i could always ask questions time went greater time crunch dictated reports available phone system encouraged listen reports asking review series films without listening report frowned upon one point time members clinic soon radiologists spun different company people longer affiliated clinic time managed care trying get everyone productivity scale radiology seemed like ideal speciality crank productivity expectations addition direct experience radiologists author also seems recognize value human brain processor i teach neurobiology students residents physicians part job lecturer help people stay awake i delve frontal cortex connections ventral striatum i put slide fact one ieee journals equivalent computing power depends simulation using today hardware may require gigawatts power equivalent power grid output small nuclear power plant ieee spectrum i ask students speculate human brain tremendous amount processing power different computers even though audience generally tech savvy young physicians students i never heard correct answer one correct answers fact human brain unparalleled pattern matching device papers estimated recognize unique patterns i start go list end studies radiologists dermatologists ophthalmologists demonstrating superior pattern matching pattern completion skill i also point ca learn medicine textbook need clinical exposure safely practice need acquire skills knowledge good papers written available pattern matching human diagnosticians compared cognitive tasks face example good radiologist many unique patterns variations need able see answer question critical yet know answer radiology medical specialty number less really know confidence interval watson may speed necessarily accuracy watson analogous current ecg computer general normal abnormal reading reading measurable dimensions much equivocal cases time tell i think health care blog post valuable lessons posts i know author clear worked radiologists long i consultations backlit reading boxes telephone conversations best possible test use investigate problem worked radiologists would know always connected throughout careers physicians obstacle connection corporate medicine author seemingly friendly advice disingenuous business administrators run health care really wanted radiologists connecting would get reasonable productivity compensation activity would need connect run back terminal read enough films make period time conference informally teaching residents specialities i think admonition connect probably means connect business administrators running health plans come back herd let tell many images read like tell physicians many patients see advising physicians behave also well known strategy manipulate real message come back herd replaced nothing would make administrator day replacing physicians machines especially physicians direct control ibm knows i know equally important question watson ca replace business administrators seem requisite lack technical expertise creativity need basic level pattern matching job certainly training would seem basic program optimize working environment physicians health care workers patients would ideal dabbling area real expertise collegiality required i conclude concepts alien ever expanding group administrators whose reason existence seems managing people whether need george dawson md dfapa supplementary although i could work post another insidious effect corporations medicine taking teaching loop radiology teaching files teaching rounds always rich source learning students residents required skill board exams i recall approaching administrator preparing teaching slides residency training exam quite easy copy de identified images onto powerpoint slides review images routinely appear major medical journals i never forget response dr dawson would want images appear teaching slides another sign apocalypse
