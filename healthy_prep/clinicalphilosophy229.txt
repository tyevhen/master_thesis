charles taylor amongst others tried hard articulate different forms understanding exist within umbrella discipline 'psychology aim promote 'peaceful coexistence idea recognise colleagues set different jobs different conceptual theoretical tools accuse job badly wrong tools i would like add tuppenceworth two forms understanding i frequently see confused psychology first aims provide forms understanding uses examples case studies example illustrate intelligible possibilities discerns aim enquiry discernment elucidation possibilities hardly matters form understanding whether one instance intelligible mode personal uncovers although would matter fact often pretty pointless broadcasting understanding one one suspected encounterable elsewhere second aim elucidate new forms understanding intend render intelligible comprehensible previously barely visible visible understood instead aims chart whether already understood actually happens frequency circumstances psychoepidemiology one way understand populations question fairly restricted first form understanding much obviously closer links philosophical forefathers exemplified phenomenological psychoanalytical approaches completely inappropriate reaction enquiry carried spirit would 'but actual evidence saying yet reaction often unwittingly solicited pundits empiricist psychology case general irrelevance may course stick depending case misunderstanding may also offer empirical generalisations evidence freud paranoia due repressed homosexuality said i show paranoia intelligibly understood due repressed homosexuality second form understanding much obviously closer links natural sciences procedures products may sometimes unhelpfully criticised unenlightening pundits intelligibility demonstrating psychology unhelpfully research best understood aiming illumination finding meaning say cataloguing meanings already understood charge boringness may still stick course depending case follows i want consider question viability causal explanation psychology i think often taken granted causal explanation long see type understanding seems me mistake operate widely often properly applicable either case attempts causal explanation psychology seeem me frequently born particular conflation two forms understanding let me clear seem good instances causal explanation ambit psychology certain neuropsychological explanations example clearly mind unproblematically causal nature reason john longer respond visual stimuli cerebral insult damaged part brain prevents 'information getting retinae striate cortex etc i feel i securer grip notion causality i idea kinds explanations paradigmatically causal however interesting consider whether causality belong primarily neurological rather psychological side explanation consider kind ethological aetiologies provided attachment theory john personality problems adulthood infant toddler developed certain attachment style z mother provoked attachment style personality style causally related z z causally related may seem obviously truistic i wonder take order z seems primarily related sharing structure pattern intelligible development take small spiral shape oval general shape take larger oval spiral loops see latter embodies form former say former shape caused latter shape imagine changed person remained undeveloped identical personality would say former small spiral pursue analogy caused later small spiral take analogy roger squires would say curtains red today causes curtains red tomorrow er answer i least would causation change stasis caused change developmental millieu z child attachment style causally related mother personality i think need distinguish two different factors one hand important sheer comprehensible intelligibility one given well surely causal story causal story whatever makes responses sediment personality causal story terms conditioning may appropriate moral causal explanation irrelevant comes certain junctures means provide typical form understanding offered psychological contexts i want turn briefly assumptions seem come along readily discussions linear regression analysis analyses often used empirical psychology enable examine correlation two variables smoking behaviour lung cancer random sampling population warranted criticism correlation necessarily indicate causality well known i sha making instead i want suggest typical maker criticism often buys assumptions warranted example course well avoid nevertheless prevalent talking prematurely 'dependent 'independent variables since inclines presuppose statistics alone completely unwarranted independent variable cause dependent ones must also i believe wary implicit idea lying behind making criticism suggested assignment causes effects one since either may wrong way round may effects common cause seems misguided me implicit idea relationship considering must considered causal terms let me give hopefully sufficiently ridiculous example consider relationship smiling reports happiness bigger smiles discovered tend albeit fairly large called 'estimated error values correlate greater amounts self reported happiness would clearly mistake suggest necessarily shows happiness causes smiling james langian moment smiling causes happiness two variables 'smiling 'happiness 'smiling certain 'self reports may imagine seem cause one another temptation i wish diagnose however saying 'smiling 'self reports glee therefore understood effects common cause happiness happiness thereby reified denatured hived constituting behaviours expressions posited cause seen extrinsic smiling etc might explain correlation smiling self reports though common cause well first i denied common cause perhaps neurological one denied psychological common cause 'happiness second expressive behaviours fall together condition possibility meaningful deployment terms 'happy however logical causal condition i said i felt attempts causal explanation psychology often product conflating misunderstanding two types psychological understanding regression factor analytic treatments psychological topics often seem perpetrate conflations misunderstandings course nothing wrong techniques something wrong interpretation findings interpretation seems suggest correlations understood terms causality either immediate derived common cause psychoepidemiological style investigation shows frequencies certain behaviours occur certain situations intelligibility finding style investigation shows say one psychological phenomenon understood intelligible causal function another mistake latter providing causal explanation take former correlation merge together seems causal psychological explanation
