eric kandel md nobel laureates come minnesota often apparently come least year gustavus adolphus college annual nobel conference year conference particularly interesting me starred modern psychiatrist nobel laureate eric kandel shared podium wife research collaborator denise kandel eric kandel giant neuroscience continued extend research well time life people retired years addiction lectures i use well known paper psychotherapy single synapse published recent work nicotine exposure risk cocaine use entitled molecular basis nicotine gateway drug published lecture references kandel neuroscientist psychiatrist longer i psychiatrist aspect kandel accessible work ability integrate basic neuroscience cognitive neuroscience coherent story possibilities best example book age insight i briefly reviewed blog clear reading kandel lot mind actively seeking answers organizing observations another feature piqued interest case presenting addiction conference state many people believe addiction treatment invented i find conference late take time work attend i pleased find presentations sessions eric kandel denise kandel available online total videos load play succession may videos kandels i watched four first session kandel discusses early discoveries brain systems idea localization brain function played physicians passing knowledge aphasia strokes bit tedious eventually gets discussion memory localization talks implicit explicit memory allows look different features animal models molecular biology types memory goes look age associated memory loss alzheimer disease different brain substrates mechanisms point slides illustrate chromatin transcription sites get bogged details defers chromatin issue later presentation discusses rbap critical transcription factor formation long term memories showed plausible mechanism exercise leading osteocalcin secretion bones improvement memory one possible humoral factor associated vigorous exercise terms style points great graphics especially diagram dna strand wrapped around histone octamers transcription process affected various molecules clearly present lot information non molecular biologists little hurried times makes misstatements gets distracted like presentations interjects humor along way presentation continues clear important information session focused primarily question addiction brain disease panelists biographical sketches viewed page i realize i viewed sessions lectures good fit terms answering question lectures focused neurobiology learning epigenetic changes due nicotine exposure lead addictions lectures neurobiology addiction per se partially suggested mechanisms related kandel work memory addiction brain disease really point lectures obvious panelists minimum resistant idea also open opposition read biographical sketches one panelists written book addiction disease really wanted argue point could brought me neurobiology addiction lecture i could dissected arguments addiction disease much better idea would bring eric nestler lecture panelists seemed opinion plastic changes brain normal therefore plastic changes brain caused addictive compounds sign pathology seemed focused brain cultural social factors thought important least one case seemed suggest addiction needs occur certain context addictions created equal example given wealthy white guy cocaine addiction could jet caribbean go swimming way deal addiction someone else would opportunity kandel singular focus human behavior everything occurs happening brain kept going back idea pointed alterations brain plasticity certainly occur addiction negative positive changes course agrees social psychological processes important intervening factors processing occurs level brain panelists seemed uncomfortable basic idea got one eventually summarized problem lack common culture extended comment include idea panel discussing problems younger generations audience start contentious point me came back mismatch kandels lectures epidemiology molecular biology nicotine gateway drug panelists arguing addiction disease denise kandel began third session reviewing epidemiology people start using addictive substances relationship nicotine general nicotine use strong predictor cocaine use ongoing cocaine use analyzed three databases essentially cross sectional surveys substance use including nsduh national survey drug use health mtf monitoring future nesarc national epidemiologic survey alcohol related conditions discussed concept translational epidemiology making population wide observations looking models explain observations i would call critical observation observed drop cocaine use cocaine related mortality cigarette use recent drop cocaine related mortality seems correlate decrease smoking eric kandel stepped basic science section elaborate mechanism histone acetylation occurs nicotine exposure denise kandel returned talk problems cigarettes potentiating factors use drugs also probably good way stop smoking time watch one videos i would recommend one final session interesting one one panelists talked sociological theories drug use rather gateway involving biological substance example fact take substance makes feel good increases likelihood take additional compounds associate people common interests encourage drug use kandel three comments session i thought interesting first involved scientific rationale reductionist approach hear explicitly stated rather used vague rhetorical manner makes lot sense second painting gustav klimt called judith beheading holofernes judith i head holofernes tells story biblical incident discusses painting combines elements aggression sensuality recent work anderson shown overlap areas brain govern aggressive behavior areas govern sexuality reproductive behavior one point kandel seemed frustrated panel members made reference reproducibility may startled denise kandel previously alluded bias reductionism discussion statement reductionist approach members audience going object strenuously videos affirming me i think lectures i give kandel work posts blog i confident i come conclusions comes brain reductionism course easier me provides conclusions i merely teach i think everybody come conclusions either scientific philosophical level easy get hung polarizing questions political debates science days especially using imprecise definitions like word disease claiming reductionism fatal flaw rather good way science easy mistake journalism many cases hatchet job journalism science striking factor brain centric view world seems like logical approach me various critics attack brain centric view neuroscience psychiatry ways seem miss point much criticism comes definitions diseases disorders idea biomedical approach brain means biomedical treatments possible i think might easier reconcile brain centric view ultimate result view considered tremendous computational power results billions people billions unique conscious states ultimate product dr kandel talking terms human learning affects conscious state associated brain substrate may something biomedical treatments also applies every intervention brought bear facilitate recovery make even obvious argument cure head ether somewhere corollary important know mechanisms time watch videos rare chance see one brightest guys psychiatry neuroscience action i would also encourage reading age insight left me impression scientist top game inspirational reading george dawson md dfapa references kandel er psychotherapy single synapse impact psychiatric thought
