student things weird wonderful i horrible habit stopping i middle work day investigate oddball idea making detour codeville five minutes later hour gone i learned heck lot kind happened yesterday i suddenly know many words latest book i already knew total vocabulary book many unique words openoffice tell thus began five minute coding adventure coder know i talking code talk five minute coding adventure actually means hour long bumbling misadventure leading multiple head slap aha moments i share terms graphs prepare amazed fast forward graphs speak code getting vocab count book two minds hard first i openoffice output book i opened firefox scratchpad window typed following code var text document body textcontent var wordmatch gi magic var thewords text match wordmatch var vocab new object get counts var i i totalmatches i thewords i tolowercase vocab vocab thewords i tolowercase bump count else vocab thewords i tolowercase start counting var results collect results var k vocab results push k vocab k magic regular expression gi geek match word boundary followed one letters optionally followed apostrophe hyphen followed zero word characters followed word boundary globally case insensitive manner gi thus regex match ca well cant would correctly matched would overly hyphenated expressions treating two words close enough though right lines code show tally unique words object js hash table table essentially let use 'anyarbitrarytext key store look values i results unique words stored results array i decided sort array word frequency bear mind array member mini array word count function comparatora var count var count return count count return results sort comparator gets wrapped function returning sorted results array okay fun begins i look results length get vocabulary count turns huge i make graph word count rank order first i tell around junk words showed initial attempt vocab count due things like single letter matches people initials footnotes r l smith gives three words mischief i later modified magic regex inserting force recognition two letters longer words gave vocab count top words way minus one letter words word count geeks already know coming next make graph word counts versus rank index find curious phenomenon harvard linguistics professor george kingsley zipf first become fixated weird fact frequent word english language occur approximately twice often second frequent word three times often third frequent word implying power law means skipping math plot logarithm word rank log frequency count get straight line plot two minds zipf plot word frequency count vs rank order words two minds click enlarge see first approximation top words two minds show striking power law distribution pattern classic zipf law i could chosen middle words gotten graph one characteristics power law relationships scale invariant part curve looks like part curve interesting thing since code already written trivial modify i decided extract vocabulary letter words see zipf law applied words graph i got looked like zipf plot letter words two minds zipf relationship still holds arguably three letter words obey zipf law course degenerate code whore experimenter i decided go step investigate letter words surely letter words perverse unique special context requirements obey power law graph zipf plot letter words two minds bit wavy still arguably zipf law example point drunk power i decided wield world destroying code wrangling abilities new way i looked stats top tweets download spreadsheet twitter statistics twitter sorted impressions numbers rank plot log impressions versus log rank guess top tweets time plotted log impressions vs log rank classic zipf law situation anything relationship tweet traffic rank order zipf like relationship word frequency word rank point i thinking okay i know i trick using blog traffic i apt see power law relationship i also long suspected couple high traffic posts way higher normal traffic acting honeypots bots spiders zipf law used forensically detect whack numbers set traffic stats i plot log traffic vs log rank last posts blog log traffic vs log rank posts blog notice bulge caused rd th points left plot two blog posts science desktop nitric oxide antidepressants sexual side effects combined traffic page views always struck me bot bait worthy two posts i ca see draw much human traffic really traffic numbers keep piling week week people really coming back posts i think i think friend k zipf telling two points fit left part curve spurious words zipf plot forensic utility tell points obey power law therefore errant fashion zipf law k power law pareto distributions worth taking time understand underlie many natural phenomena zipf pareto distributions accurately describe size craters moon word frequencies languages sales curves bestselling books intensity solar flares citations scientific papers wealth distribution city size distribution many natural distributions see excellent paper details fundamental phenomenon nature huge forensic implications think zipf pareto describes bestselling book stats able detect whether author gaming system looking books whose sales stand incredible degree system follows zipf pareto laws outliers points fall curve suspect forensic importance potentially glad took detour codeville me join main highway coffee
