little nubbin post tonight mostly get brain churning topic i need bit reading journal affective disorders number intriguing papers month next one association inducible neuronal nitric oxide synthase polymorphisms recurrent depressive disorder sound intriguing i keep eye nitric oxide literature see pet far i know completely unproven theory strong link insulin resistance depression inflammation hyperglycemia also due insulin resistance making endothelium inner cell layer blood vessels less responsive nitric oxide make one hypertensive prevent men getting erections make men want go low carb i sure would endothelial nitric oxide synthase enzyme part pathway makes nitric oxide blood thought part larger neuroprotective regenerative pathway part could explain anti depressant effects exercise meditation would imply high blood sugar would rather like anti exercise sloth anti meditation stress neurochemically speculative entirely wall course never simple anyone reading nitric oxide figure certain areas brain much nitric oxide bad news pro oxidant pro inflammatory authors today paper state may conclude may beneficial detrimental effects depending concentrations location source duration exposure despair three different types isoforms enzyme churns nitric oxide inducible nitric oxide synthase neuronal nitric oxide synthase endothelial nitric oxide synthase call inos nnos enos purposes understanding healthy brain inos nnos bad enos good add excruciating detail familiar evolutionary psychiatry theme glutamate binds nmda receptor leading flux calcium cell activating nnos via calmodulin biochem geeks addition inflammatory cytokines cause brain cells called astrocytes microglia make via inos increases glutamate release inos nnos part glutamate nmda calcium excitotoxic neuron killing inflammatory cycle brain badness pathway linked depression anxiety parkinson dementia schizophrenia even non psychiatric illnesses migraines rheumatoid arthritis interesting thing paper researchers checked genetic make caucasian european people recurrent depression around episodes average years non depressed controls found carriers certain types nitric oxide synthase genes likely resistant depression types nitric oxide synthase genes protective depression similar smaller study done asians show linkage i reading see information falls overall evo med scheme especially exercise mindfulness side things i link paper pertinent previous posts sometime tomorrow reading sunday night i ipad i know nitrous oxide nitric oxide blue velvet hey i got get random googlers somehow might mimicking central nervous system chew bit time bed
