yesterday post i discussed evidence parkinson disease possibly caused defects energy efficiency mitochondria susceptible poisoned individuals i mean whole parkinson series anything post bring interesting questions already know ketogenic metabolism seems increase energy efficiency brain else might well researchers already looking trials compounds interest coenzyme also known ubiquinone creatine published animal studies small clinical trials coq human trials ongoing coq creatine coq interesting vitamin molecule yesterday i compared mitochondria cells energy factories ski resort proton pumping complexes mitochondria pump gradient rather like ski lift carrying skiers hill eventually energy used transport electrons across membranes electron transport chain atp created skiers set free fly hill beat analogy death coq bit like attendants top ski lift making sure everyone gets lift okay guiding skiers lifts small doses coq seem help symptoms parkinson large doses mg seemed mildly helpful even larger doses tried creatine compound made amino acids basically helps body make atp easily according wikipedia article make lot creatine dietary amino acids half creatine taken directly eating skeletal muscle muscles vegetarians lower creatine animal studies supplementation creatine combined coq helpful parkinson symptoms anyone reads statin skeptic literature knows statins lower coq levels pubmed search reveals lot papers subject questions arise whether statins cause heart failure due coq depletion heart like brain energy hungry coq depletion time might damage heart study i linked showed lower coq statin users worse heart failure people low coq link statin use worsening heart failure also questions coq depletion causes als lou gerhig disease whether coq depletion causes known rare statin side effect diabetes obvious question would statins cause parkinsons small study found seem link parkinson progression statin use brief editorial notes population studies higher ldl cholesterol levels associated lower risk parkinson disease rotterdam study statin use seemed correlation parkinson disease risk small studies showed use cholesterol lowering drugs associated decreased risk parkinson turns serum cholesterol levels triglycerides strongest determinant serum coq levels reason coq rides along lipoprotein complexes body moderate alcohol use also seems associated coq increases best dietary sources coq meat eggs certain vegetables broccoli dietary intake correlated much serum levels though could serum levels much cholesterol floating around i make confusing mess coq powerful antioxidant one whose jobs likely protect cholesterol triglycerides transported scary circulatory system people lots inflammation high triglycerides high cholesterol high coq high coq probably protective parkinson disease perhaps robust amount cholesterol statins also antioxidant antiinflammatory possible attributes make obliterating cholesterol making machinery depleting body coq least case parkinson disease jury though still
