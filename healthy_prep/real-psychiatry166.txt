available patient go weekly infusion maintain depression either remission partial response cultural level besides dissociative agent anesthesia ketamine also collection drugs known club drugs abusable ketamine among commonly abused drugs nsduh survey puts lifetime abuse practice addiction psychiatry less likely used lsd much less likely used dextromethorphan may one many drugs used polysubstance users point usage history ketamine also classified psychedelic drug drug cause hallucinogenic dissociative experiences time use popularized belief experiences could potentially beneficial standpoint
