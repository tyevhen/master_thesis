readily observable psychiatrist sees patient back realizes receive care hospital notes patient discharged request imminently dangerous financial interests managed care systems counties involved overlap perfectly point i keep coming back old term quality quality care never involves discharging disabled person convenient rationalized community standard determined everybody except experts involved case state statutes focus psychiatric professional organizations defining standard care optimize treatment instead throwing managed care model rationing care rationed care resulted non existent system care patients psychosis long system remains non functional small percentage people violent psychotic also get care need prevention violence individuals psychosis starts improving standard care everybody rather trying pick violent individuals crowd george dawson md dfapa
