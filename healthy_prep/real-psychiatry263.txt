friend dropped miles second made way last third trip falling asleep bike trip several others taught me valuable lessons cycling picture top post me stepping bike initial test cruise yesterday i slightly younger i would biking soon snow melted less years ago i biking gateway trail mountain bike i hit patch ice went hard i dusting myself i recalled story gastroenterology colleague mine years

colleague told me sitting waiting ride start started rain sleet starting time soaked cold shoes full ice cold water got bike walked van would finish line shirts picked shirt went home i guess lesson point realize enjoy cycling miserable lot easier ignore misery younger younger physiology also lot better i pretty well years ago i episode atrial fibrillation pretty well i mean essentially unlimited exercise potential i could go hard i wanted long i wanted point even point eventually i realized even exercise induced tachycardia predisposes person atrial fibrillation i tone high heart rates conservative range order prevent episodes atrial fibrillation conditions predispose atrial fibrillation i country i always watching heart rate monitor instead speed somewhat depressing impact self image go unlimited exercise capacity somewhere deterioration spectrum goals varied past years biking miles per week speedwork racing fastest race time occurred i would mile rides weekend miles rides week half milers i would try ride fast i could days goals lot conservative modest goals may little optimistic comparison i watched fabian cancellara lead peleton appeared leisurely pace small french town years ago mph flat heart rate bpm i thought i would share observations things i learned years cycling might useful use good gear keep good working order kind bike ride highly subjective i first started cycling high end bikes could assembled components i used ride vitus frames aluminum tubes glued together mechanical components made campagnolo shimano suntour various prices ranges time favorite components suntour superbe pro seemed light effortless i liked way gears changed seemed like lot less rolling resistance suntour went business one day i currently ride trek bike carbon fiber frame riding aluminum frames years bikes today much better every way used bike lot pays ride best bike afford go shop people explain fit bike ride bike gives consistent pain part body always feel stretched ready go hesitate buy bike think looks cool hesitate buy many bikes want strong motivators riding safe stay alive biking many ways like getting open land rover driving serengeti among predators large animals anything happen minimal protection pulling driveway i always double check air pressure always max i make sure front wheel ready fall pounding fist i riding high pressure tires tire liners prevent blowout i time fix flats road i become hypervigilant i screaming hill duluth one day took split second large black labrador run bush right front tire hitting dog like hitting tree stump speed i went right handle bars onto shoulder i personally know many cyclists killed became quadriplegic accidents like main reason i continue lot upper body strength training provide elasticity event crash another close call i heading south cty hwy square lake trail north fo stillwater minnesota washington county highest per capita income county minnesota reflected state roads happens roads county line get worse ultimate biking territory roads feet pavement right side white line lot biking space compared county highways coming north lane truck pulling boat trailer i heard scraping saw sparks suddenly boat trailer reared disengaged back truck headed right me cut front me feet i think i saved ultra wide shoulders washington county i always stay right hand side line wide margin i takes little experiment prove best place ride count number cars hundred see crossing line proximity riding number i get see happen riding next hopefully new car designs lane deviation alerts train people stay driving lane going long time everybody let face drivers may intoxicated even light day stay competitive want i never big time racer i rode annual unsanctioned mile event kind free pretty dangerous pack style race end riders using aero handlebars ouch always massive crash ten mile mark riders cat rode practice i recall reading greg lemond book attitude get older basically responsibilities time commitments away cycling also true ever since i left madison wisconsin i solo biker exception play date wife arranged tri athlete husband one health club friends plan miler mahtomedi chemolite plant hastings back square lake park via stillwater back mahtomedi guy took like time trialling i catch mile mark hit wall speed started fall precipitously last third way mph range eventually fell bike fractured wrist last miles stillwater i riding next trying convince stop i could call wife get picked incident captures problems biking people mutual expectations kind competition least benign competition skill level ballpark well overall expectations ride people encounter along way time unlimited exercise rule passed within reason i would also try catch anyone horizon unassuming manner possible aging taken toll i pick battles two years ago i biking towards average sized hill i noticed pack guys quite bit younger me closing fast i naturally assumed social brain worked like mine trying trounce old man going hill time i trying stick heart rate rule exceeding bpm i looked i already bpm i increased speed match figuring maxed trying close distance bottom hill i shifted bigger gear hit hard i could group caught me halfway hill seriously faded i first guy top i wo tell heart rate time i somewhat elated especially last rider group looked me said sarcastically nice work lance people view competitiveness either character flaw desired personality characteristic i see neither me embodiment training study field well third dimension long put ultimate deterioration body i win little competitions i devise myself anonymous opponents i never know battle death anxiety mortality good way stay physically fit process drivers either paying attention trying kill bike long enough even pay attention newspapers cyclists always getting killed seven hundred thirty two cyclists killed every year injured possible police record injuries town people per year suggests me fatality estimate also low i personally know experienced inexperienced cyclists killed seriously injured one noted cases driver mowed three cyclists trying adjust cd player defense inattentive drunk driver far right lane marker possible try avoid sharing actual traffic lane whenever possible additional helpful approaches avoid riding traffic know basic skill requirement able bike straight line veer road seems easy type distraction including talking fellow riders looking left shoulder cause drift traffic lane ride traffic drifting road reason ride traffic glance left shoulder drift traffic lane know ca stop bike completely put feet ground look behind bike people know trust biking distances speed know person front going pull sudden without warning cause crash lead veer traffic lane ride single file time except enough shoulder surface comfortably ride side side enough confidence fellow riders know make contact cases nature ride plain dangerous i recall riding aspen independence pass shoulder road gets inches wide winds pass day i constant airstream trailer traffic vehicles pulling trailers outfitted long side view mirrors see around trailers dangerously close make matters worse i aware cyclist hit behind one mirrors image mirror imprint back made ride lot less enjoyable sometimes cycling goals take dangerous territory spite everything know safety aggressive drivers entirely different problem come several classes i would described appropriately angry driver enraged driver personality disordered driver significant overlap personality disordered driver enraged driver depends assumption person defects emotional reasoning absence major character pathology far i know study done prevention always best initial approach i mean anything piss drivers take much two ton vehicle obligated adhere rules road risk legal penalties suddenly cyclist oncoming lane buzzes right stop sign action enough cause mild mannered banker personally know start pounding steering wheel hands screaming epithets window ask me i know simply put anger fewer drivers adhering rules prevent angry encounters remains ignorance traffic laws several weeks i encountered angry young woman cycling toward me wrong direction side road riding traffic aggressively swearing me telling me i going wrong way i politely told read drivers manual obeying traffic laws keep cross hairs various personality disordered citizens i biking myrtle street stillwater mn one day quite haul road bikes come small enough chainrings make hill comfortably i way suddenly young man large wd pick
