note story i wrote back april originally appeared slightly shorter form bigthink i reproducing i strongly feel story needs get many people possible story dark side antioxidant research well known outside medical circles unseemly story profoundly unsettling story refuses made pretty happy uplifting matter hard try duct tape silver lining around fit antioxidants good mantra sells billions dollars per year blueberry pomegranate fortified granola bars tocopherol enrichened cereals acai berry jell mixes juices yogurts added vitamins organic baby foods forth mention billions dollars nutritional supplements sold year say nothing sub industry books magazines devoted nutrition still story needs told know bodies buried decades mainstream medicine pooh poohed possibility vitamins supplements could move needle major diseases two time nobel laureate linus pauling harshly criticized suggesting role vitamin prevention treatment cancer even laboratory workers known years changes diet could influence rate tumor appearance lab animals early case control studies epidemiological evidence variety sources begun accumulate showing persons routinely ate large quantities fresh fruits vegetables consistently better regard cardiovascular disease diseases people sir richard peto colleagues published paper nature dared asked simple question dietary beta carotene materially reduce human cancer rates nature shortly thereafter national cancer institute whose chemoprevention branch headed dr michael sporn one coauthors nature article decided green light two large intervention based studies cancer preventing effects nutritional supplements study finland involving beta carotene alpha tocopherol vitamin based study involving retinol form vitamin beta carotene finnish study conducted finland national institute health welfare initially designed encompass male smokers ages smokers male years old lung cancer ten times likely affect smokers hence cancer study limited smokers would need tenth many participants study involving general population based known age specific rates lung cancer among finnish men study designers calculated desired effect size hoped decrease cancer incidence period years would measurable required level statistical relevance older male smokers made study group turned age distribution actual volunteers match demographics eligibility group volunteers tended toward young end eligibility range result study enrollment target reset order get good statistical relevance full scale recruitment subjects atbc alpha tocopherol beta carotene lung cancer prevention study began april continued final enrollment men occurred june enrollees randomized one four equal sized groups receiving either mg day times rda alpha tocopherol mg day beta carotene equivalent around times rda vitamin bt together placebo time say starting small brief pilot studies validate recruitment mechanics carotene retinol efficacy trial caret started enrolling volunteers unlike finland atbc study volunteers caret male female heavy smokers came asbestos exposed workplace environments ranged age divided initially four groups mg day beta carotene iu retinol carotene plus retinol placebo treatment groups consolidated one group taking beta carotene retinol study design called continuing vitamin regimen reporting results occur alas things went horribly awry caret never got far finns reported results atbc study april sent shock waves medical world alpha tocopherol beta carotene provided expected protective effect lung cancer supplement treated groups actually experienced cancer placebo group fact astonishing result utterly bewildering contradicted numerous prior animal studies shown vitamin beta carotene promising cancer preventatives surely error occurred something gone wrong one thing could chance variation almost participants three quarters treatment groups small study results could statistical fluke turns finnish investigators actually done meticulous job start finish analyzing data looked possible confounding factors confounder found heavy drinkers treatment group got cancer often light drinkers two weeks finnish study hit national cancer institute awash conference calls accounts vary knew caret lead investigator seen finnish group data prior publication knew nci serious problem hands caret essentially experiment finns done except giving even bigger doses supplements participants study due run another three half years caret treatment group also experiencing elevated cancer rates participants might dying needlessly indeed statisticians presented interim results caret safety endpoint monitoring committee august four months finnish study appeared print became clear caret participants anything faring considerably worse counterparts atbc study even safety committee found deadlocked whether call premature halt caret study formal stopping criteria given something called brien fleming early stopping boundary met ultimately decision made continue accumulate data safety committee simply believe results data aberrant additional numbers could gathered would surely show early numbers wrong second interim statistical analysis presented caret safety committee september one year first analysis according committee time clear excess lung cancer continued accumulate intervention regimen rate time since first interim analysis cardiovascular disease excess persisted conditional power calculations showed extremely unlikely trial could show beneficial effect intervention even adverse effect ceased occur delayed protective effect began appear therefore semc voted unanimously recommend nci trial regimen stopped follow continue study halted january nearly two years final publication finnish results even caret participants contacted snail mail let know study early termination reasons caret results published new england journal medicine may shock waves reverberated throughout medical world participants taken beta carotene vitamin supplements shown higher rate lung cancer also fared worse cardiovascular related mortality worse cause mortality great reluctance medical community believe results perhaps even worse results caret study relative finnish experiment decision include asbestos exposed individuals treatment group persons turns intensive segment analysis asbestos group data relative heavy smoker group showed statistical evidence heterogeneity relative risk among subgroups caret study fact done replicate atbc results provide beginnings dose response curve finns used mg day beta carotene caret employed higher dose result cancer hard understand results atbc caret studies light fact another large trial involving beta carotene physicians health study reported neither harm benefit mg beta carotene taken every day years however physicians health study population younger healthier atbc caret study groups predominantly made non smokers turned quite important read almost years since atbc caret results reported day clinicians aware results either study least learned time bjelakovic et al undertook systematic review existing literature antioxidant studies covering time frame systematic review procedure conducted using well regarded methodology cochrane collaboration group specializes known high quality meta analyses analyzing rigorously designed studies supplement effectiveness bjelakovic et al found study subjects total treatment population persons died taking antioxidants whereas placebo takers control groups totalling persons died studies including atbc caret results studies question used beta carotene vitamin vitamin vitamin selenium separate meta analysis miller et al found dose dependent relationship vitamin cause mortality participants clinical trials daily doses international units vitamin appears helpful harmful miller et al concluded view increased mortality associated high dosages beta carotene vitamin use high dosage vitamin supplements discouraged evidence ef cacy documented appropriately designed clinical trials make sense results many studies shown harmful effect antioxidants many studies particularly carried animals also carried predominantly healthy human populations shown clear benefit answer may something called apoptosis otherwise known programmed cell death body ways determining cells become dysfunctional point needing told shut cells reach point mitochondria kick cascade reactions involving caspases enzymes designed terminate cells cancer therapies exert effect inducing apoptosis fairly well accepted normal healthy individuals precancerous cells constantly formed destroyed apoptosis normal healthy adult many billion cells day non cancerous destroyed way antioxidants known interfere apoptosis essence promote survival normal cells well cells allowed live young non smoker good health level cell turnover apoptosis body nowhere near high level turnover older person someone high risk cancer therefore antioxidants apt good harm young healthy person body harboring cancer cells want anitoxidants encourage growth neoplastic cells interfering apoptosis real lesson antioxidant research food industry people make nutritional supplements interest telling things read know story dark side antioxidants story made possible thousands ordinary people died name science owe take story heart smoker high risk heart disease cancer consider scaling back use lipid soluble antioxidant supplements particularly vitamins could save life need scale back vitamin however potent anti cancer effects please found information helpful share family friends facebook twitter followers others story needs get cancer industry going tell far much money made selling year chemotherapies one going look health might also like aspirin cancer prevention bigthink enormous body evidence points vast reductions cancer rates wide variety cancers take nsaids like iburofen aspirin daily vitamins turn deadly caret disaster took long terminate study investigators knew full well people dying unnecessarily needs antioxidants free radical theory aging plain wrong
