richard bentall david bell rather different psychodynamic theories paranoia different theories causes paranoia different forms theory different ways relating causes effects differences perhaps could unnaturally said spread meant talk 'causal explanation i mark differences terms 'empirical 'phenomenological calling i trying categorise already understood categories advertise prior explicating conceptual difference needs marked using terms thus bentall scientific psychologist wants develop psychological hypotheses test wants show paranoid people really process information way theory suggests contrast never seems occur bell psychoanalyst derive general testable hypotheses paranoia kleinian theory proceeds instead giving formulations examples 'all get seems reasonable assume takes required provide psychologist asks bell scientific failure schooled actually substantiating claims empirical evidence schooled putting question nature answer well i think i explain general empirical method far i understand bentall psychologist proceeds take state paranoia develop measure state explanandum want explain kind explanation seek individual psychology makes likely experience paranoia next identify external triggers internal states internal traits may conceivably give rise paranoia latter two inner states traits psychological explanantia develop measures inner states degree implicit low self esteem person deep feels quality underlying 'self representations degree explicit self esteem paranoid person consciously explicitly represents inner traits habits information processing bias toward making external personal attributions triggers obtained finally correlate measures positive relation measures explanantia degree low self esteem attribution bias measures explanandum paranoia constitutes evidence truth psychological model character theory might summed like paranoid people people like part like paranoid data collect empirical evidence truth theory contrast bentall bell psychoanalyst proceeds according i calling 'phenomenological method explanans projection explanandum paranoia try collect evidence increased level projection leading increased amount paranoia conceived psychological trait independent phenomenon throws paranoia triggered rather psychological process defence mechanism bell saying paranoid person always deals distress projection saying projection characterises paranoid reaction experienced threats selfhood wanted could say reference projection way understanding rather explaining paranoia would important saying take done index phenomenon simply using terminology thereby either explained understood better bell offers way seeing paranoia paranoia suggests relocating disturbing feelings oneself others one sees i suggesting would wrong say sees paranoia caused projection would wrong think 'caused meaning 'precipitated wrong contrast 'characterised yet might still describe 'a function could also wished describe differences terms bentall whole trying tell makes paranoid people vulnerable paranoia bell trying deepen understanding means paranoid bentall method runs various self confessed difficulties around testability p perhaps i suggest hard convincingly operationalise suggests hard accurately test underlying opposed explicitly expressed low self esteem i want go instead i want focus another feature theory whilst hypothesis testing geared assess whether paranoia may upshot making external personal attributions something triggers painful low self esteem nothing method allows test whether paranoia motivated avoidance painful low self esteem nb i saying bentall even thinks testing aspect theory method taking measurements making correlations nothing establish psychodynamic aspect either bell understanding paranoia understanding motivation attribution bias projection central point psychoanalytic model helps understand paranoia least certain forms seeing motivated see human behaviour including inner behaviour i thought motivated see expressing intelligible desire see separately identifying behaviour desire correlating otherwise conjoining two thought instead desire life within action somehow stored behind action encounter desire characterises action could say rather action upshot imagine see someone withdraw burning hand hot stove separately identify action desire relieve pain bring together thought naturally may imagine strange cases someone wants burn hand win dare mindlessly withdraws flame scratch itchy nose nothing remove default presumption hand withdrawn flame absent requisite strange defeating conditions hand withdrawn burning pain note say even happens rundle pain hand withdrawal effects common physiological cause burning rather latter upshot former understanding motivated avoid pain understanding avoidance caused pain avoid pain seek pleasure rather vice versa one could say contingent fact lives masochism must remain special case pain unintelligibility answer motivated avoid pain whilst must careful avoid theorising fact la 'simulation theory etc understand withdrawal burning hand flame relating predicament makes immediate sense left trying make sense one thing terms thing already understood concept 'immediacy temporal instead non mediated nature understanding something intrinsically intelligible defines form intelligibility rather something intelligible terms something else something made intelligible something else insisted 'by empathic projection putting oneself shoes another said 'ok long immediate grasp empathic projection thought two separate things one done means 'empathic projection best form taken immediate grasp motivational meaning return paranoia bell aims i calling understanding whereas bentall aims i indexed 'explanation given bentall clearly trades understanding proposing demonstrating paranoia motivationally explicable better note bell bentall aim understanding whereas bentall aims addition explanation scientificity comes along explanation may say bentall account scientific one judge basis bell account un scientific may infer rather limited criterion non scientific reliance grasp intrinsic intelligibility motivation less bentall bell interested noting often paranoia motivated independently identifying features paranoid people appear increases likelihood becoming paranoid project project instead make motivational forms paranoia intelligible providing rich exemplary phenomenology better method case study bell theory scientific failure i would argue successful attempt providing pre scientific foundations meaningful understanding paranoia whatsoever
