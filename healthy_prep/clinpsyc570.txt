david healy interesting article advances psychiatric treatment entitled antidepressant tale figures signifying nothing deserves attention two main points one relating safety antidepressants another relating efficacy let start safety suicide rare event difficult predict much statistical certainty thus antidepressant trials lack statistical power show differences suicidal acts antidepressant placebo clinical trial data rather consistently shown increased relative risk suicide suicidality antidepressants versus placebo absolute risk remains low thus resulting differences statistically significant say oh well less likely differences antidepressant placebo due chance alone prescribe drugs want apparently many think need sure drug related significantly suicides something healy starts discussing analysis conducted lilly showed relative risk suicidal acts fluoxetine nearly twice acts placebo difference statistically significant due general rarity acts overall analysis gave relative risk suicidal acts patients taking fluoxetine compared placebo ci led beasley et al state analysis incidence suicidal acts suicidal attempts completions revealed statistically significant differences rates fluoxetine treated placebo treated patients conclusion drew lack significance data trials show fluoxetine associated increased risk suicidal acts emergence substantial suicidal thoughts among depressed patients beasley et al using analysis return beasley et al paper clear although statement analysis incidence suicidal acts revealed statistically significant differences rates fluoxetine treated placebo treated patients supportable lead conclusion data trials show fluoxetine associated increased risk suicidal acts emergence substantial suicidal thoughts among depressed patients healy fails mention work i found disappointing example beasley meta analysis later found mention made benzodiazepines coprescribed clinical trial program order minimize agitation lilly recognized fluoxetine could cause reference made patients dropped anxiety agitation drop rate statistically significantly greater placebo holds true ssris well healy psychotherapy psychosomatics coadministration benzodiazepines control agitation removing people dropped agitation anxiety perhaps likely suicidal results statistically significant certainly point much toward suicidality fluoxetine placebo later khan et al american journal psychiatry examined rates suicides ssris active comparators placebo found relative risk ci favor greater suicide ssris including antidpressants found rr ci let keep mind issues coadministration benzo applied many studies well studies though unclear many counting suicides placebo washout participants receiving placebo nobody taking antidepressants placebo suicides biases data favor drugs appearing safe see links inappropriately attributing suicide suicidality placebo even deck stacked favor showing drug safety still enhanced suicide suicidality risk associated antidepressants compared placebo curious eh perhaps deck stacked difference would actually achieved magic p value less wait next healy discusses another khan et al meta analysis journal affective disorders healy said recent article one striking instances unwillingness think signals might offer evidence hazard posed therapy came khan et al review deaths suicide adults participating clinical trials fluoxetine paroxetine sertraline clomipramine fluvoxamine clonazepam venlafaxine obsessive compulsive disorder posttraumatic stress disorder social phobia generalized anxiety disorder panic disorder dataset concluded found suicide risk among patients anxiety disorders higher general population factor finding unexpected sample patients selected considered minimal risk suicide khan et al anxiety disorders suggested posed risk suicide fact dataset patients taking active treatment patients taking placebo reported suicides active treatment groups suicides placebo groups data suicidal acts incomplete combined data suicidal acts suicides show relative risk active treatment placebo takes prior judgement antidepressants could trigger suicide interpret data evidence suicide risk posed anxiety disorders rather antidepressants used treat p wait still according comprehensive meta analysis subject relative risk suicidality ssris versus placebo fergusson et al bmj quote healy december medicines healthcare products regulatory agency mhra published report antidepressants suicide committee safety medicines expert group safety selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors gave data suicides adult placebo controlled trials sertraline citalopram escitalopram fluvoxamine venlafaxine mirtazapine relative risk completed suicide active treatments compared placebo emerged relative risk suicidal acts active treatment compared placebo relative risk combination suicides suicidal acts compared placebo values statistically significant led clear warnings depending meta analysis examined sometimes statistical significance always strong trend relative risk two greater suicidal acts actual suicides drug compared placebo occurs despite studies inappropriately assigning suicidality suicide placebo occurred placebo washout period placebo compared medication benzodiazepines coadministered many original studies healy goes point may fact entirely enamored conventional significant testing many cases case safety i agree differences rare events may difficult detect statistically heavy bulk evidence falls clearly one side equation indicative iatrogenic effects treatment essential pay attention evidence i post separately issue mentioned healy regarding efficacy since post already long enough
