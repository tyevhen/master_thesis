post i mean review basic neurobiology compulsive behavior uh oh turned computers started watching past episodes top chef desserts could morgan anyway also figure dr garner presumably serotonin deficient hair pulling mice began scratching removing hair serotonin promoting mouse chow diet added glucose tryptophan understand might happening back talk obsessions compulsions exist brain everything place brain right click new tab song compulsions mean performing unpleasantly repetitive seemingly unnecessary acts order prevent perceived negative consequences step crack break mother back scratching hair pulling twisting fit definition people often perform behavior stave anxiety impulsivity predisposition toward rapid thoughtless acts without regard eventual negative consequences gambling uncontrolled aggression hair pulling trichotillomania picking may also fall category first glance compulsion impulsivity may seem opposites run parallel neuronal tracts people symptoms one often symptoms compulsive impulsive psychiatric diseases among highly inherited diseases psychiatry obsessive compulsive disorder adhd tourette autism substance abuse disorders indisputably run families suggesting even psychiatric disorders physical brain differences susceptible disorders children autism example likely tics repetitive physical movements consistent tourette ocd impulsivity consistent adhd obsessively driven drink gamble also likely impulsive well sorts subcategories different kinds obsessive impulsive behavior exist along different neuronal tracts complexity therefore immense however one conceptualize brain two things impulsive behavior compulsions one hand brain tracts promote behaviors tracts generally run center primal parts brain outer civilized cortex cortex tends work opposite direction inhibiting compulsions impulsivity therefore one become vulnerable behaviors via two means either problems increase primal signals center brain problems block civilizing influence outer shell brain terms neurotransmitters serotonin deficiency thought responsible part anxiety driven behaviors obsessions skin picking hair pulling etc dopamine deficiency cortex responsible impulsivity adhd however dopamine excess thought responsible motor tics tapping autism example obsessive physical acts let bring back garner mice genetically prone hair pulling behavior jaminet postulates due predominant th immune inflammation response infection hair pulling worsened increasing serotonin turnover brain despite general rule anxiety picking hair pulling behaviors due serotonin deficiency mood opera classic fast may much mystery like think paper garner brought fact ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors used treat trichotillomania also induce skin picking behaviors idea i stretching bit end paper particular strain mice would bad candidate ssri treatment may right may wrong increasing serotonin turnover brain via diet administering ssri problem thinking know anything human brain brain immensely complex remember hundred billion neurons interconnections fire times per second strictly limit serotonin talking different flavors receptors subtly different things garner mouse diet increased serotonin turnover overall brain presumably jacking general serotonin signal well mouse models everything shown increasing activation serotonin receptor htc receptor increases compulsive behavior like garner mice ssris work little differently blanket administration serotonin brain ssris result downregulation post synaptic receptors among htc therefore general decrease overall signal away compulsion perhaps relieving symptoms ssris tend favor serotonin signal another receptor serotonin receptor activating receptor tends reduce anxiety compulsions music psychiatrists use whole host ssris prozac paxil zoloft celexa lexapro yawn yawn one serotonin receptor activator buspar hta agonist may well one useless medicines experience better worse limitations ssris better job modulating anxiety compulsion symptoms straight administration serotonin via tryptophan promoting diet tryptophan supplements medicines interest blog knowledge work animal models give clues brains work i find interesting brains better diet whole foods enough omega many omega weird industrial designer pseudofood toxic plant proteins likely garner mice tell straying design parameters diet brain likes may well cause major problems sugar tryptophan supplementation may cause major problems share genetic vulnerabilities mice one theory i also question whether kyurnetic inflammation general escalated garner mice experimental diet comments dr jaminet post want add speculation increasing inflammation i think likely scenario tryptophan precursor serotonin kyrunetic former helps modulate major brain circuitry communication latter seems encourage excitatory communication excess neurotoxic kyurnetic elevated cases inflammation ssris increase serotonin initially weeks post synaptic receptors regulated overall effect much increase serotonergic transmission make transmission go efficiently ssris also seem favor metabolic pathway tryptophan serotonin rather kyrurnetic possible massively increasing tryptophan uptake brain context baseline inflammatory diet genetically vulnerable mouse population increases kyurnetic leading neurotoxicity mouse psychopathology i big fan l tryptophan htp reason i know fan due tryptophan role infectious theory neurotoxicity since scenario probably occurs human brain well makes one wonder usda diets take pick many plausible methods increasing tryptophan increase picking hair pulling behaviors reasons eat well beginning
