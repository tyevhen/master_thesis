headlines everywhere medical students significant prevalence suicidal thoughts suicides typical explanations burnout depression associated rigors medical training considering medical training always rigorous obvious questions include depression suicidal thinking prevalent true research offers little hard data consistent longitudinal studies use methodology look issue suicidal thoughts suicide attempts medical students studies generally cross sectional using diverse methodologies involving different cultures prevalence suicidal thoughts varied given year prevalence lifetime suicide attempts ranged studies determined suicide rates male female medical students studied showed difference suicide rates men compared general population higher rates women studies look comparison rates general population evidence i aware medical training become rigorous stressful used early training days i saw residents particular subjected training schedules i guessing longer occur due limitations work hours best examples surgical specialty rotations second third year residents hardly ever left hospital even intern days common work hours straight next day pm total hours every three four days schedules exhausting widely accepted recent changes made allowable hours trainees volume material covered medical school combined poorly defined guidelines needed known proficient physician efficient approach study comparing medicine rigorous undergraduate course training illustrates problem i taking physical chemistry chemistry undergraduate i knew i read specifics sections text know lecture notes take tests lecture notes text medical school connections less clear read one texts know lecture notes testing often guess work typically body knowledge fluid might hold year year level inefficiency keeps people studying far long order take tests long run mean lot less typical way depression suicidal behavior physicians trainees studied look prevalence depression suicidal ideation suicide populations studies generally suggest suicide preventable cause death one physicians group good self correcting typical comparison physicians group better public large comes smoking cessation reduced risk cardiovascular pulmonary disease led experts hypothesize unlike smoking getting treatment depression suicidal thinking involves many barriers relative health care interventions physicians may concerned confidentiality stigma potential impact career standard health measures cases issue reporting disciplinary action mentioned expert opinion generally recommends education depression suicidal thinking physicians facilitating access mental health care screening trainees depression also suggested burnout become popular theory lately efforts put number burnout suggest high rates medical specialties relationship burnout depression suicidal thinking less clear i looked problem time striking factor medical practice total loss control physicians thirty years ago medical students residents training programs exposed strenuous training schedules also saw physician models could provide latest scientific care direct impact patient treatment environment general medical students start valuing direct patient contact time ones end fields minimal patient contact contrast today striking today students residents exposed training environments strict control business managers management frequently direct obstacle scientifically based care frequent obstacle routine care rational person going subject intensive stressful training see professional futures control people routinely interfere care waste physicians time incredible degree based whim me seems like textbook example learned helplessness paradigm observing learned helplessness research paradigm depression laboratory animals observed animal subjected inescapable aversive stimulus point animal stops responding trying escape response deficit associated biological markers consistent depression treated pharmacological agents used treat depression rodent models learned helplessness considered screens molecules potential antidepressant effects interesting variation effect learned helplessness proxy animal studies show fear conditioning learned proxy research literature intergenerational transmission anxiety depression studies suggest learning effects especially environments significant amount emotion significant less studied phenomena like identification mentors also effect environments several linear crisis model suicide generally based progression risk factors experience suicide non linear process involves subtle changes conscious state stressful emotional environments likely associated altered conscious states physicians levels training several factors make difficult escape real imagined failure pursuing career medicine debt factor significant one ongoing justifications physician salaries high cost medical training walking away anxiety producing scenario yet one study showed medical students considered due excessive workload exam stress expectations mentors friends family variable consideration increase thoughts failure men women life stage physicians training idea real medical practice like finally ready make transition used clear models form attending physicians encountered rotations recollection attendings appeared normal full lives especially time active clinical rotations today medical students residents see practicing physicians normal lives see physicians coming one two month rotations see practicing physicians rotate one week one week year long rest lives see primary care fragmented clinic staff hospitalists case psychiatric rotations generally see people hospitalized settings nobody wants stay nobody really gets much better readmission rates high ruling case managers medical training telling attending physicians got shock puts many medical students idea career medicine even get started gives message really need go medical school decision making dictated business managers also gives message cog business medicine machine expect much personal contact patients medical treatment based relationship finally notice science medicine immersed suddenly become relative next great idea head administrator whatever business idea suddenly physicians organization whether scientific relevant concerns suicide prevention always legitimate endeavor irrespective quality epidemiological evidence physicians obligation recognize colleagues crisis try help appear significant barriers medical trainees physicians getting help widely recognized i fear deteriorated practice environment given sufficient weight etiological factor sense make go widely acknowledged stressful training end physicians longer allowed practice professionals impact occurs trainees observe many physicians currently practicing like residents end sight learned helplessness always instead limited training permanent dimension medical practice sounds like recipe desperation
