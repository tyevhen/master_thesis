website dana farber teaching research center affiliated harvard medical school conclusion behavior cancer cell dictated genetics particular set mutated genes within also epigenetics system controlling expression genes states catherine wu lead author study scientists know cancerous tumors made variety genetic mutations within many different subgroups cells study wu explained researchers wanted find cancer inherent genetic diversity matched corresponding epigenetic diversity first scientists expected find systematic match genetic epigenetic changes words thought genetic diversity tumor would mirrored range methylation patterns instead researchers surprised find methylation patterns great deal random disarray fact disorderly methylation pervades entire tumor stated alexander meissner broad institute joined research team findings published online journal cancer cell revealed disarray methylation one defining characteristics cancer landau et al counter intuitively rather presenting
