early career i assistant principle investigators clinical trials drugs treat generalized anxiety disorder major depression schizophrenia alzheimer disease job top screen patients medical histories physical examination follow throughout research protocol easy job difficult part making sure research patients getting medical complications new experimental drug addition assessing possible therapeutic effects one main complications nocebo effect hype placebo effects antidepressants i always found curious mention nocebo affects clinical research illustrate i vividly recall young man began complain number side effects antidepressant protocol severe headaches body aches nausea unable sleep anxiety continued increase weeks insisted stopping experimental medication days approved research protocol allowed investigators break blind let people know taking active drug i recall embarrassment i explained getting placebo active drug adverse reaction placebo nocebo effect one main problems i encountered effect clinical trials even bigger problem today loss research subjects terminated early due nocebo effects example i gave patient developed significant side effects response placebo people also develop dramatic side effects active research medication whether likely get effect active drug active placebo active study drug actively studied critical questions fda trials require intent treat analysis clinical trials means research subjects complete protocol whatever reason need included analysis becomes problem subject treated active drug terms true response also side effects reporting fda package inserts contain detailed information medication side effects today many cases side effect comparison active drug placebo nocebo related data skew side effect data reported package inserts i always thought antidepressant trials ideal setting study nocebo effects came across paper two years ago time frame last two years interesting one saw speculations release dsm summer much speculation involved sensational articles media suggesting antidepressant medications work ate least better placebo effect speculation suggested pharmaceutical manufacturers american psychiatric association via dsm interest broadening market antidepressants increasing use point critics suggest may serious problem clinical trials based nocebo effect interestingly many critics non professional forum complained mostly side effects medications cases described medications dangerous paper reference looks people receiving placebo pooled sample placebo arm data industry sponsored multi site randomized clinical trials antidepressant medication treatment acute major depression adverse event data recorded clinical trials adverse events ae pre existing nonspecific somatic symptoms

taking active drug getting side effects unrelated drug although untreated depression might expected worsen much nocebo modulated much crosses active drug significant number people dropped trial due
