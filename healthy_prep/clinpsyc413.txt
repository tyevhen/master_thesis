i focus dr martin keller seriously poor science post panorama excellent job profiling keller role helping promote paroxetine known paxil usa seroxat uk note lengthy post bold section headings help find way martin keller chair psychiatry brown university according curriculum vita scientific publications people take opinions seriously known key opinion leader thought leader academia drug industry mean well videotape see panorama episode keller said respected honorable person therefore give opinion something people tend listen say individuals gave opinions worth considering keller study glaxosmithkline conducted study numbered examined efficacy safety paroxetine versus placebo treatment adolescent depression keller lead author article american academy child adolescent psychiatry appeared regarding results study text article vs actual data going examine text article said versus data study said article paroxetine generally well tolerated effective major depression adolescents p data effectiveness primary outcome variables hamilton rating scale depression ham mean change ham final score improved paroxetine statistically superior placebo four eight measures paroxetine superior placebo note however superiority always small moderate best margin whole accurate take paroxetine either better slightly better placebo data safety emotional lability occurred participants paroxetine compared placebo hostility occurred patients paroxetine compared placebo fact paroxetine patients hospitalized due adverse events including emotional lability due aggression worsening depression manic like symptoms compares patient lability placebo group apparently point required hospitalization total people serious psychiatric adverse events paroxetine compared one placebo exactly emotional lability hostility quote james mccafferty gsk employee helped work study term emotional lability catch term suicidal ideation gestures hostility term captures behavioral problems related parental school confrontations according dr david healy certainly much inside knowledge raw data company documents background hostility counted homicidal acts homicidal ideation aggressive events suicidality lability overt aggression hostility sounds much nicer way conveniently defining depression page study report authors opined study demonstrates treatment paroxetine results clinically relevant improvement depression scores measures showed advantage paroxetine either based arbitrary cutoff researchers could course opt whatever cutoff yielded results wanted actually valid measures depression measures significant either global measure improvement paints optimistic view treatment outcome cherry picked single items longer questionnaires also think following moment single question questionnaire interview obviously going broadly cover symptoms depression single question cover many facets depression implying single question interview shows advantage paroxetine shows paroxetine superior treating depression utterly invalid logic akin finding patient flu reports coughing less often medication compared placebo medication declared superior placebo managing flu despite medication working better many symptoms comprise influenza whitewashing safety data gets even bizarre remember people serious adverse psychiatric events taking paroxetine well researchers concluded none adverse psychiatric events caused paroxetine interestingly one person became labile placebo event attributed placebo magical study drug make suicidal placebo later document keller colleagues said acute psychosocial stressors medication noncompliance untreated comorbid disorders judged investigators account adverse effects patients sounds me investigators concluded beforehand paroxetine incapable making participants worse drum explanation serious events occurring david healy also discussed fallacious assumption drugs cause harm keller know study data i paraphrase briefly panorama video keller discussing study role examining analyzing data said reviewed data analytic tables mentioned soon printouts item numbers variable numbers even words i tend look i better words symbols emphasis mine ghosted according panorama documents i obtained paper written ghostwriter keller response ghostwriter saw paper superb job thank much excellent enclosed rather minor changes me neal mike emphasis mine let remember keller apparently wish bother looking numbers would also appear want bother much words based upon numbers third party technique tried true trick get several leading academics stamp names study manuscript suddenly appears like study closely supervised every aspect data collection data analysis study writeup independent academics thus glaxosmithkline telling product great independent researchers bastions academia brown university university pittsburgh university texas southwester medical center university texas medical branch galveston stamping approval product future posts keller background relatively well known keller makes much money consulting research arrangements drug companies fact several years ago documented keller pulled single year lucrative deals looking stuck name study write endorsing conclusions clearly far actual study data one seriously believe keller operated independent researcher believe isolated incident see example keller involvement study examining effects risperdal risperidone treatment depression study presented number times never appeared author presentations yet study published name appeared author real kicker allegedly helped design study according published article played major role study would acknowledged earlier via listed presentation author apparently helped design study completed obviously major feat whole story put name paper readers would believe strongly study due big name status addition keller wrote effexor reduces episodes depression long term though clearly misinterpreted study findings fair many researchers made mistake believing ssri reduce depression quote earlier post words ssris similar drugs effexor withdrawal symptoms sometimes lead depression looks like effective preventing depression people often get worse shortly stopping medication drug companies wyeth case effexor would like believe means antidepressants protect experiencing depression get better good long term treatment accurate statement antidepressants protect substantial withdrawal symptoms stop taking keller way study data keller camera keller response asked increased suicidality among participants taking paroxetine study interesting none attempts led suicide led hospitalization well i suppose huge increase suicidal thoughts gestures okay commentary opinion leader statements shape opinions among practicing psychiatrists really trouble next well consider post start regarding paxil seroxat way data pimped gsk merits discussion discussion allegedly detached academics role debacle
