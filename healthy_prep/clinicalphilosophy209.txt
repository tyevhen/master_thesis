i fortunate enough experience recently three perspective shifts cbt know popular psychotherapeutic sadomasochistic practice aided part convincingly cbtish even convincingly humane therapeutic supervisor shifts simultaneously helped me develop apt ways less literal understanding theory practice cbt also brought understanding closer 'one take decent generic psychotherapy perspective notion cognitive behavioural therapy first shift concerns status 'beliefs cbt easy knock cbt containing overly intellectualist psychology really hold feelings behaviours especially see clinic driven doxastic
