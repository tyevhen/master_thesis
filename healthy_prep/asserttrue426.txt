quick species life earth abundant species living members species hint alien probe lands random location earth chances better probe encounter organism thinking terms ocean right track may surprise connection world populous organism revealed shortly mosquitoes dive bombing neck week equally amazing link mosquitoes back yard hydrothermal vents ocean floor hundreds bright little particles narrow end wasp egg wolbachia cells i thinking marine biology deep sea hydrothermal vents i went online genomevolution org day little nosing around genome wolbachia pipientis ultra tiny bacterial parasite carried nearly every mosquito earth caution attempt following dna analysis tricks unless want become thoroughly addicted desktop omics i microbiologist training i stunts safely parasite actually wrong word tiny friend wolbachia parasitize mosquito integral part mosquito wolbachia ca live outside insect host guess host frequently ca live without wolbachia two provide essential services arrangement known mutualism i would argue wolbachia mutualistic symbiont proto organelle something close lynn margulis mind ancestor today mitochondrion wolbachia ca live outside world far anybody knows needs live inside host generally arthropod although filarial worms also carry wolbachia inside host occupies special niche lives nursery cells insect ovary cells go become egg cells ordinary symbiosis i mentioned earlier post wolbachia carries genes reverse transcriptases resolvases recombinases transposases translocases dna polymerases rna polymerases phage integrases complete suite retroviral machinery designed export foreign dna host dna indeed researchers found wolbachia dna quite often embedded host nuclear dna one group looking four insect hosts four nematode hosts found anywhere base pairs million base pairs wolbachia dna residing nucleus another group found wolbachia genes incorporated fruit fly host nuclear dna situation wolbachia thus parallels situation mitochondria know gene products go make mitochondrion actually encoded nuclear dna mitochondrial dna encounter organism baffling wolbachia oftentimes want know relatives closely related new poorly understood organism close relative already well studied sometimes learn lot hurry particularly true pathogens wolbachia pathogen per se pathogens virulence strategies various kinds maybe wolbachia symbiosis strategies learned relative problem lot super tiny microbes wolbachia definitely quarter much dna coli relatedness always well understood organisms assigned taxonomic slot assignment changes years later better studied example cowdria ruminantium eventually renamed ehrlichia ruminantium bunch former ehrlichias neorickettsias except ones attack red blood cells anaplasmas taxonomy end evolutionary tree definitely work progress deep sea thermal vents like one home organisms like thiomicrospira grow sulfide co basic salts fortunately easy nowadays many organisms dna sequences available online go web compare genomes directly using tool like synmap i started wolbachia i started going list mini microorganisms began running dna similarity tests wolbachia ehrlichia neorickettsia anaplasma chlamydia usual suspects ultra small chromosome end tree life i found surprised me bizarre little bacterium called thiomicrospira kept showing blast searches many genes common wolbachia based sequence matches large numbers genes none taxonomy charts showed two related dna lie i kept coming matches across hundreds genes bear mind wolbachia genes begin small even bacterium bizarre thiomicrospira one fairly newly discovered microbes lives sulfur heat co bottom ocean total darkness vicinity thermal vents thiomicrospira kind life form nasa takes great interest could prototype exactly type survive dark co using organism might live ice crust europa saturn moon theory could geothermal vents floor large ocean liquid water nasa pretty sure exists europa ice life could well look like thiomicrospira thiomicrospira many genes common mosquito symbiont thiomicrospira organism lives bottom ocean wolbachia lives inside arthropod eggs one obtains carbon form co produces co waste product one adapted live warm salt water lives cold blooded insects theory two germs could apart yet oddly enough hundreds genes common genes well matched dna sequence similarity standpoint thiomicrospira dna even incorporates prophage module phage genes show high percentage base pair similarity phage genes wolbachia see screen shot remarkably thiomicrospira wolbachia share certain phage genes common shown genes dna sequence identity little detective work i found organism might well form missing link mosquito symbiont thermal vent dweller organism kept showing analyses high degree dna similarity thiomicrospira wolbachia organism question pelagibacter ubique known candidatus pelagibacter although might question taxonomic assignment since candidatus members obligate intracellular symbionts astonishing organism two ways first smallest non parasitic free living bacterium known science million base pairs dna making slightly smaller wolbachia tiny cousins secondly numerous living thing earth present large amounts every one earth oceans pelagibacter placed candidatus clade due small genome cell size certain ribosomal markers mitochondria like genetic profile fact people think pelagibacter ancestor today mitochondrion theory satisfying consider pelagibacter ancient tied sea analysis using synmap found pelagibacter thermal vent dwelling cousin thiomicrospira share genes pelagibacter whereas wolbachia pelagibacter share around thiomicrospira wolbachia share around called non syntenous point matches genes instances gene occurs organisms high percentage base pair matching synteny concept takes gene matching one step says clusters similar genes count synteny level higher plants animals one thing level mini microbe tends lack meaning genes bugs like wolbachia notoriously mobile find new positions chromosome time probably large number transposases nucleases integrases genome even i decided carry bit syntenic analysis see i could find purposes analysis i defined syntenon three co proximal genes match three genes organism genome part syntenon three genes triplet occur within gene span match genes gene span organism dna plus genes order organisms planet spanning waterworld thought exist europa icy outer crust thermal vents exist bottom life exists may look lot like thiomicrospira using synmap i found whereas wolbachia pelagibacter share around syntenic genes thiomicrospira wolbachia share around thiomicrospira pelagibacter share makes sense ocean dwellers comparison control purposes i triplet match thiomicrospira another chemoautotroph organism gets energy inorganic chemicals carbon co namely methanothermobacter marburgensis syntenic triplets common two chemoautotrophs wolbachia methanothermobacter hand triplet matches match two wolbachia species mosquito dwelling variety fruit fly dwelling cousin produced gene matches syntenic triplets seems reasonable me based previous sorts analysis also direct inspection genomes terms respective protein products thiomicrospira evolved pelagibacter pelagibacter abundant life form ocean perhaps oldest pelagibacter also mitochondria like thiomicrospira rhodanese like proteins full cytochrome system redox enzymes citric acid cycle enzymes plus certain characteristic membrane sensor proteins flippases etc worth thiomicrospira highest signal transduction profile i ever seen mistdb making mitochondrial feeling i tempted say similarly thiomicrospira wolbachia related phage proteins common genes patatin proteins share multiple drug resistance genes strange antibiotics occur naturally environment share genes flp type pilins plus many coincidences big small first blush deep sea thermal vent seems pretty far removed environmentally egg cell mosquito reconcile difference actually i see similarities thiomicrospira thrives temperatures degrees celsius also true mosquitoes although prefer degree end scale blood preferred food source mosquitoes comparable ph salinity seawater also mosquitoes aquatic lifecycle require brackish water lay eggs mosquitoes salt marshes go back millions years even possible wolbachia might live deep sea vent dwelling host organisms fact i predict found addition inhabiting flying insects spiders mites ticks filarial worms wolbachia also found high percentage crustaceans know crustaceans often found living near deep sea thermal vents many crustaceans show characteristic feminization genetic males often tipoff massive wolbachia presence insect populations insects crustaceans represent two oldest successful widely distributed life forms animal kingdom would really surprising bacteria colonize life forms closely related common marine bacteria planet i think stranger things happened
