one recurrent themes blog application science medicine especially public policy level plummeted past three decades directly attributable influence business levels government one pervasive themes behavior health professionals best accomplished incentivization words financially punish physicians get change behaviors want financially reward behaviors want produce i looked scorecard lately guess punishments greatly outweigh rewards maybe perspective skewed working hmo many years considered reward held back part salary gave physicians group met desired productivity targets i sure took mbas dream one equation seems simple ok want goal want pay rewards anymore let penalize people meeting goal eventually everyone compliant goal probably better example medicare hospital readmissions program recent editorial jama notes readmission rates medicare patients within days associated potential cost billion since congress levied medicare reimbursement penalty hospitals readmission rates considered high problem hospitals penalized safety net hospitals disproportionate share low income patients hospitals likely penalized three years since penalty started likely hospitals lowest operating margins likelihood penalty also correlates percentage patients treated elderly live poverty disability authors opine hospitals penalized demographic characteristics patients point evidence suggests exactly happening conclude targeting hospitals penalties even indirectly simply hospitals care poor people good policy use foundation build argument proposed policy initiative hospital readmissions program accuracy accountability builds safeguards hospitals treating patients disadvantaged socioeconomic status obvious problem authors logic seem realize discrimination patients lowest socioeconomic status institutionalized occurring decades people i referring people addictions severe psychiatric problems facts clear past years even though psychiatric disabilities rank top disabilities measure get much smaller fraction health care dollar care i used example middle aged man woman hospitalized emergency department acute chest pain i know fraction people discharged next day consider basic scenario evaluation chest pain turns non cardiogenic hospital i worked generally means evening telemetry serial troponins either stress echocardiogram next day echocardiogram stress test price tag less hours hospital hand let say person exacerbation affective psychosis able function home put risk hospitalized low tech psychiatric unit goal discharge longer dangerous discharge upon request held involuntarily irrespective price tag care best available data i drg reimbursement care irrespective length stay economic incentives line rarely provide discharge resources require maintain even subsistence life style remain stable enough stay emergency departments jails furthermore many cases states previously charged patients portion medication costs per month disability income direct indirect costs incurred patients families severe mental illness addictions travesty highest magnitude rationing mechanisms place past three decades results care subpar relative medical specialty created entire population patients chronic illnesses discriminated financing care set number perverse incentives would seem destabilizing incentive hospital discharge order beat designated days diagnosis related group drg readmit necessary entire drg incentivization admissions discharges pseudoscientific sleight hand based crude demographic variables would expect readmissions policies different second dimension care unscientific care based demographic factors first place i previously practice consultants never practiced medicine came commented complexity patients time i caring many patients i knew would never admitted general psychiatric units hospital state due medical complexity consultants concluded patients complex patients state even though could define measures used make determination nobody mentioned inherent conflict interest pro discharge administration hires consultants agree world view discharge patients soon possible another scenario committee i asked demographic determined characteristics time lines treating community acquired pneumonia led differences mortality complications nobody knew original big data approach medicine looked hedis variables practicing physician knows incredibly crude approach many cases meaningless better example saying treating acute chronic psychosis days makes difference outcomes nobody knows best treatment approach practically hospital screens functional cognitive capacity two well known areas psychiatric disability outpatient sphere equivalent saying minutes three four times year emphasis medications likely taken patient possibly affect real life outcome case patients addictions treatment dire person using heroin alcohol excessive amounts benzodiazepines get admitted detoxification get admitted residential treatment society representative governments levels saying situation ignore conditions clearly life threatening many cases fatal ignore businesses governments say collection disabling life threatening diseases ignore either make money divert money treat socially acceptable life threatening disabling diseases clear pattern discrimination affects elderly anyone psychiatric disability addiction authors want something i say let start reversing years discrimination psychiatric substance use problems clearly based socioeconomics especially lack vocal political constituency poor research based demographic variables rather complexity lack innovative research based poor resource allocation george dawson md dfapa references boozary manchin rd wicker rf medicare hospital
