funny availability much free dna data go head i learned dna sequence data mitochondrial genomes could accessed free genomevolution org i could resist i wrote scripts checked dna composition mtdna mitochondrial dna sequences i found blew me away biologist accustomed thinking genome guanine plus cytosine content kind phylogenetic signature related organisms usually values fairly close one another purposes following discussion i going reference content course one minus gc gc content means content i learned mitochondrial dna shows strand asymmetry coding regions regions actually get transcribed rna opposed non coding control regions junk dna particular shows excess pyrimidines message strand exact opposite situation archaea bacteria message strands tend accumulate purines interesting thing like bacteria archaea mitochondrial genomes tend show steady predictable rate increase purines message strand increasing even though purines outnumbered pyrimidines message strand picture might make clearer purine content versus message strand mitochondrial dna coding regions every point graph represents mitochondrial genome see regression line minimizes sum squared error upward sloping rise meaning every increase genome content corresponding increase message strand purine content striking similar graph bacterial genomes see post regression line slope turned chargaff second parity law predicts straight horizontal line obviously law kaput i written repeated finding bacteria archaea eukaryotes viruses bacteriophage basically every place i look message strand purine content accumulates proportion genome content strand asymmetry respect purines pyrimidines seems universal strand asymmetric buildup purines pyrimidines hard explain without invoking either theory strand asymmetric dna repair theory strand asymmetric mutagenesis reasonable suppose one strand dna vulnerable mutagenesis another yes accept growing cell strands spend good portion time apart transcription replication neither replication transcription symmetric implementation i spare details replication side argument suffice say replication related asymmetries likely opinion behind purine pyrminidine strand asymmetries i documenting seeing i think result asymmetric repair transcription time transcription gene dna strands separated one strand used template rna polymerase create messenger rna ribosomal rna strand free floppy vulnerable attack mutagens also readily accessible repair enzymes diagram oversimplifies things considerably i include benefit non biogeeks might want follow argument note dna strands directionality sugar bonds face one way one strand way strand denoted called orientation strands rnap rna polymerase dna repair complex subject assured every cell every kind dozens different kinds enzymes devoted dna repair without enzymes life know would end dna constantly undergoing attack requiring repair ogg family dna base excision enzymes exhibit signature helix hairpin helix topology hhh see faucher et al mol sci types repair take place double stranded dna dna undergoing replication transcription types repair apply single stranded dna bacteria well higher life forms transcription coupled repair system tcrs comes play rna polymerase stalled thymine dimers dna damage remarkably elaborate system changes short sections damaged dna considerable energy cost involves replacing whole nucleotides sugar categorized nucleotide execision repair system ner alternative ner base excision repair ber defective base usually oxidized guanine gets snipped without removing sugars dna backbone enzymes perform base clipping generically known glycosylases many years thought mitochondria dna repair systems know true mitochondrial dna subject constant oxidative attack turns damage quickly repaired double stranded dna evidence repair single stranded mtdna scant looked transcription coupled repair system indeed ner system mitochondria found one mitochondrial ber repair via ogg exist seems operate dna double stranded transcription makes sense ber finish strand must nicked ap endonuclease bad base popped repair proceeds matching opposing base opposite abasic site using strand template clostridia archaea ogg enzyme bacteria see post paper ogg pop bad base dna single stranded ogg binds abasic site released ap endonuclease arrives later bottom line know mitochondrial dna spends much time unwound state mtdna products highly transcribed non transcribed dna strand extremely vulnerable oxidative attack template strand less vulnerable cloaked enzymes rna polymerase transcription factors ribosomes etc also know oxoguanine prevalent form oxidative damage mtdna uncorrected damage leads transversion finding consistently high pyrimidine content message strand mitochondrial dna see graph consistent slower rate repair non transcribed strand differential occurrence transversions strand least possible explanation pyrimidine richness message strand mtdna additional factors consider selection pressure mitochondrial dna tends encode membrane associated proteins membrane proteins use nonpolar amino acids turn predominantly encoded pyrimidine rich codons upcoming post
