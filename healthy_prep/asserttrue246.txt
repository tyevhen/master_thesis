time i puzzling fairly big riddle i think answer becoming clear riddle many organisms codons turn rate approximately equal rate usage reverse complement codons take good look symmetry following graph codon usage rates frankia alni bacterium causes nitrogen fixing nodules appear roots alder plants codon usage frankia alni notice given codon usage corresponds roughly rate usage corresponding reverse complement codon graph codon freequencies f alni shows strange correspondence i commented codons reverse complements ggc occurs high frequency organism protein coding genes reverse complement codon gcc also high frequency codon say taa low reverse complement tta also low i seen relationship many organisms hundreds often chance question codons often occur direct proportion rate occurrence corresponding reverse complements make sense notion base pairing come play organism natural selection chooses codons protein gene codons collinear one strand dna base pairing rules play role choosing codons i think fact base pairing play role answer obvious think know single stranded rna properly constructed fold back form loops stems complementary regions base pair certainly secondary structure mrna widespread consequences codon selection codons stem regions complement fairly obvious seems me reasonable explanation riddle reverse complement codon selection secondary structure mrna possibly single stranded dna far pervasive might suspected pervasive enough affect codon usage way shown graph evidence secondary structure widespread i think go looking complementary sequences inside protein coding genes f alni example find many probe i script check intragenic complementing length sequences mers protein coding genes f alni i presented pseudocode script earlier post based known base composition stats organism i expected find mer pairs chance i found pairs located genes i looked complementing mers i expected find occurring chance instead found pairs genes previous post i showed similar results sorangium cellulosum bacterium enormous genome previous i showed similar results mycoplasma genitalium one tiniest genomes free living microbe regions internal complementarity affect codon choice indeed i looked top f alni genes terms number internal complementing mers i found pearson correlation codons reverse complement codons looking bottom genes i found correlation lower numbers moreover virtually unchanged i calculated pearson coefficients using expectation adjusted codon frequencies say i used base composition stats predict frequencies codon i subtracted predicted number actual number codon example frequency occurrence guanine f alni protein genes frequency cytosine hence expected frequency gcc actual frequency correlation still existed practically unchanged adjusting expected rates occurrence codons bottom line correlation frequency occurrence given codon frequency reverse complement codon otherwise hard explain quite readily explained presence protein coding genes significant amount single strand complementarity type could expected give rise secondary structure mrna basis reasonable suppose conserved secondary structure actually major driver codon usage bias please show post biogeek friends thanks
