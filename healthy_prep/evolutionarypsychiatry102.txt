past week deluge papers relevant sphere blog march beware ides psychiatrist readers northern hemisphere likely accentuated higher latitudes know exactly i mean sunlight returns agitation anxiety insomnia awakened phone clinic ringing hook well always ringing hook usual importantly life family nearly enough time day week universe next week i flying austin song seems apropos los lonely boys heaven right click open new tab mean time i least attend papers maybe crank new psychology today blog post two i start paper available full text online nature offshoot molecular psychiatry provocative theory pathos really amazing paper go take peek absorb diagrams little dry way better nutrition literature theory depression know associated certain types inflammation brain certain red immune system flags see syndrome depression quite frequently specifically increases cytokines tnf alpha il reactive protein chemicals found blood spinal fluid tell brigade immune system high alert kicking taking names speak problem invading es left kick invaders clever elude defenses brains get full onslaught neurons die ca concentrate avoid social activities cry lot eventually primary care doctor gives therapist celexa sends see someone like me certainly know genes combination stress predispose depression folks bulletproof wo get depressed dire circumstances people seem far vulnerable takes bit mismatch temperament parent child major psychopathology predisposition depression hereditary therefore must encoded genes genes pathos authors would suggest genes predispose depression also protect infection infection humans brave new modern world endured years agriculture brought dense population massive infectious disease tuberculosis example said killed humans ever lived genes might give genetic advantage infectious pathogens may lead vulnerability depression inflammation like army double edged sword people trigger happy immune systems likely survive many infections though tricky beast like flu killed young adults robust immune systems via massive pulmonary immune reactions septic shock since infections developing world tend preferentially kill young children strong selection pressure genes save young even genes cost later life selection pressure would strong clinical depression obvious survival downsides person affected offspring depression tends chronically recurring also strike folks unlike say alzheimer cardiovascular disease thus selection pressure depression alleles would likely significant unless alleles protected something even deadly often strikes even younger like infectious disease cool theory evidence well schizophrenia geneticists tried brute force hack human genome order find depression gene like schizophrenia lot success answer similar schizophrenia probably lot diseases fall simple single gene model likely lie looking group genes particular functions say immune function brain communication finding many different problems pathways genetically predisposed depression genome searching couple genes come consistently involved depression certain predisposed families happen involved cytokine signaling immune function would heck coincidence one allele found associated increased risk depression along decreased risk tuberculosis infection parvovirus hepatitis lower risk death hospitalized critically ill genes found associated depression risk found large population genome wide association studies discussed many genes pathways history blog mthfr version methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase reduced activity means folate eat diets harder time transformed folate active brain methylfolate since folate necessary make things neuroransmitters dna brain without folate sad state low mthfr associated increases homocysteine overall inflammatory tone since low folate also associated devastating birth defects one would think would pretty strong selection pressure gene actually fairly common population well inefficient version mthfr found protective cytomegalovirus infection sexually transmitted disease hepatitis places sufficient folate food mthfr inefficiencies may devastating could mean protection infections cause devastating birth defects disease sub saharan africa low folate availability mthfr allele nearly absent apoe another molecule discussed length signaling molecule located surface lipoproteins carry around fats cholesterol vitamins like ldl apoe original ancestral allele carry higher risk alzheimer disease depression associated increased inflammation general protective version means decreased risk major depressive disorder alzheimer compared allele may protective childhood diarrheal illnesses seem vulnerable tuberculosis malaria studied debated alleles associated depression called short long form httlpr gene promotor region tells cell make serotonin transporter short allele particularly two short alleles seem much higher risk developing major depression exposed early childhood trauma whereas long form gene protective however short gene bad seem lower risk dying sudden infant death syndrome gene associated higher circulating cytokines response stress could protect stress wounded infection populations short gene common also tends exposure epidemic infections suggesting selection pressure short gene finally thought put clinical syndrome depression might protect offspring acute infection well known inflammatory mediators il interferon induce depression symptoms come infectious disease depressed would keep isolated conserve energy reduce appetite maybe induce ketosis improve viral bacterial immunity i think strength evolutionary ancestral paradigm studying disease helps provide sensible framework like pathos theory clinically helps focus immune system inflammation may altered modern diet stress lack parasites pseudocommensals changed sleep infectious burden physical activity forget random crapshoot mere brute force epidemiology many confounders lead wrong direction often using clinical definition depression sad mood reason grief usually talking sad mood inability enjoy things used enjoy poor concentration poor unrestorative sleep appetite change classically poor appetite guilt self doubt even suicidal thoughts
