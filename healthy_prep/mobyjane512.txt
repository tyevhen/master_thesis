often fails today therapist patient really get occurs counseling office patient trying fix history still mad shortchanged want somehow reimbursed kind reimbursement possible therapy takes many years patient still using process blame avoid seeing fear result seeing fear addressing make positive behavior choices therapist patient believe patient trying fix patient daily life true would need go patient past background child abuse nothing adult choices except harder form new patterns behavior fall habitual use old ones old poor behavior patterns power limit one use good behavior patterns includes former crazy behavior well often thought choice person realize fact simply put energy practicing new behavior patterns become dominant old poor behavior patterns old behavior patterns still exist memory banks new ones take precedence old ones cease used often due brain plasticity ability create new neural patterns result new behavior new thinking seems simple people prefer cure poor behavior patterns complicated excuse lack success want lack success human nature settle old ways known even miserable risk new old phrase goes better live devil know new ways generally involve dealing fear repressed fears extremely painful willing risk addressing fear less need excuse use energy take simple road instituting new better behavior patterns therefore better life hope helps funny thing could write kind life history background substitute real one take therapist change would effect therapy difference real history explains fear need fear explained need address fear finish move read
