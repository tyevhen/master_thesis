post intended explain bubble diagram i used last post overprescribing focuses physician rather number extraneous factors speculative causes overprescribing make sense literature spotty references include diagrams purported mechanisms overprescribing i consider i want put i know bubble bubble explanation follows starting top left diagram bubble easily identifiable unconscious motivations one areas i consider primary cause encompasses unconscious preconscious causes best way look examples overidentification patient seems fairly common cause example physician might attention deficit hyperactivity disorder realize able much better academically lower threshold seeing problem others based experience medical group seeing many adhd patients colleagues prescribing far stimulant medications really special case physician wanting something positive patient lead reduced awareness causes substance abuse person seeking cognitive enhancement drive prescription process wish appreciated positive relationship patient another issue consider patient clinic uncomplicated upper respiratory infection near end clinical encounter patient senses prescription starts get annoyed patient talks past experience antibiotic always seems clear cold symptoms put physician defensive antibiotic issue rather argue patient physician hands prescription scenarios reflect unconscious factors involved prescribing far i tell important area untouched overprescribing literature medical knowledge occurs two levels first rote declarative knowledge involves memorization factual knowledge medications seems like fairly basic skill amount information talking encyclopedic illustrate one pull recent fda approved package inserts drugs advertised television pharmacological details presented neutral highly detailed manner prioritization terms contraindications precautions still lot memorize experienced clinicians still read documents repeatedly use summary references gain enough experience medication second level patterns become familiar using drug example i prescribed drug enough times i tell anyone taking experience medication experience patients information really available anywhere else also lead directly additional testing external validation best objective source external validation prescribing medications according fda approved indications instructed documents labels prescriptions backed data i typically research label prescribing medline searches looking actual clinical trials looking application example would include looking use gabapentin chronic pain treatment alcohol withdrawal even though fda approved applications ample evidence use medications including specific dosing recommendations conservative prescribing bias goal always treat primary problem also eliminate minimize problems related medication goal physicians i heard expert treatment anxiety disorders suggesting patients needed treated point toxicity medication medication could reduced necessary far i tell another issue exceeding fda approved range medication use quality markers dose range multiple medications class nothing new date back least years information also part informed consent patient hear options time change considered i spent lot time correcting unnecessary high doses polypharmacy generally benefit patient involved social context group interested physicians keep research analyze prescribing patterns robust safeguard overprescribing setting example benzodiazepines benzodiazepine related sleep medications prescribed circumstance stimulant medications used review colleague medical director documentation signed form review procedure available group utility preventing variation prescribing patterns practice variation practically every major clinic hospital program targets antibiotic overprescribing especially overuse expensive toxic antibiotics last defense bacteria multiple drug resistance social factor powerful safeguard overprescribing physician source information teaching physician position teach patients medication generally nuanced knowledge medication avoid stereotypes like i see problem i always prescribe drug also aware likelihood patient recovering without drug fact drug effect make weak classic example low back pain adults patients generally lack knowledge importance avoiding deconditioning need ongoing physical therapy back specific exercises generally surprised conditioning provides significant amount pain relief brief examples done dimensions occur context political regulatory influences example fda initiatives approve potent opioid medications essentially much different terms risk current medications opioid epidemic guidelines suggested outside sources may useful insufficient evidence information broadly disseminated clinicians bubbles listed diagram potent factors countering trend may lead oversubscribing involve penalizing threatening physicians typical actions used law enforcement politicians may caused problem first place reader note i concerned diagnostic proliferation i think overprescribers based availability new diagnoses i base observations patterns exist independently new diagnoses provide number examples physicians trained something medical surgical course career bias panned number areas targeting tendency productive complaining pharmaceutical companies diagnostic manuals guidelines especially major regulatory agency bias get drug general use based highly variable scientific evidence recently noted fda also ignore recommendations scientific committee end best assurance adequate medical treatment minimal risk treatment depends expertise judgment physician george dawson md dfapa supplementary staring diagram i think i need add th bubble i would probably call heuristics would focus cognitive emotional biases exist prescribing example everyone practice may person addiction subsequently able take addicting medication without relapsing primary addiction reason making rule prescribing number ways look potential biases prescribing improve evaluative structure process
