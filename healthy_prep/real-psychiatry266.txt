i thought i would add facts speculation really known epidemiology toxicology involved aircraft assisted suicides turns substantial studies written bottom line kind person want avoid reading i tell events rare especially events involving commercial aircraft incident ruled suicide aviation authorities events rare prediction doubtful many cases descriptions suicidal statements behavior occur day events extenuating circumstances like use alcohol intoxicants really interested events numerous places see analysis happened ruling national transportation safety board ntsb media reaction similar seen following mass shootings united states initial shock typically period speculation causes disaster form motivates person something like invariable dissection life media bullied personality like computer clues missed suggested one day would start shooting people psychiatrists involved get firearms familiar touchstones exhausted take long analysis starts take characteristics groups agendas gun advocates suggest person typical gun owner therefore tighter gun laws needed gun control advocates provide counter arguments usually involve easy person get gun political impasse largely due power gun lobby politicians start talk wrong place wrong time mental health advocates especially anyone wants talk real problems mental illness violence disenfranchised gun control advocates nothing ever happens screening advocates step suggest many incidents could prevented screened enough people anyone familiar bayesian statistics knows work may cause harm good impasse second wave speculation starts driven largely people ascribe theory psychiatric medications psychiatric treatment cause homicidal behavior couple schools thought one first medications idea specific medications like ssris lead homicidal behavior fact seeing psychiatrist associated homicidal behavior therefore psychiatric treatment must level cause homicidal behavior least psychiatrist responsible stopping i explored

aircraft accidents caused pilot suicide lists suicides time period proportionally associated fatalities pilots already self report substance use problems suggestions screening would enhanced pilots could self report problems without fear recrimination way licensed health care professionals allowed many states focus would treatment rather punishment health care professional experience demonstrates leads significantly self reports consistent goal public safety since pilot certification occurs federal level health care professional licensing occurs state level opportunity develop standardized approach potentially compromised pilot depends self report screening currently occupational substance abuse treatment program called hims states least part goal preserve careers broader focus include voluntary self report psychiatric conditions suicidal thinking would result referrals treatment potentially impact suicide rate aviation regulators aviation industry collect data healthcare industry marvel reading sheer amount data acquired evident anyone involved aviation single minded focus safety methods data acquisition flight recorders checks balances ground far superior safety standards health care industry united states basic thought experiment imagine recording similar outcome data patients rapidly discharged hospitals i talking real data survey nurse hands patient coached check i imagine data would look like i know data looks like quite ugly little ironic health care experts especially case psychiatrists behavioral experts going rush correct wrong aviation industry comparison health care measurement incident analysis smoke mirrors know collect relevant data many outcome measures strictly political meaningless anything bringing aviation safety experts run hospitals instead mbas i read i doubt possible improvement beyond voluntary reporting making sure always second crew member cabin commercial airliners commercial aircraft crashes planes stolen

rare combination numerators denominators chosen fact screening rare events generally successful screening rare events likely work flight crews currently undergo random urine toxicology prevent use intoxicants impair ability pilot anecdotal evidence would suggest useful case addictions often attempts circumvent intervention use drug detectable experience health care professional screening
