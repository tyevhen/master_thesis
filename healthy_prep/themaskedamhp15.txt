cruella devil surprise th may i heard theresa may announcing pledging rip introduce place new law finally confronts discrimination unnecessary detention takes place often went say first day downing street last july i described shortfalls mental health services one burning injustices country abundantly clear me discriminatory use law passed three decades ago key part reason today i pledging rip introduce place new law finally confronts discrimination unnecessary detention takes place often stated vulnerable people subject detention including police cells unnecessarily cited increase compulsory detention hospital reason reform also announced would new safeguards people mental health problems capacity refuse consent treatment never treated jeremy hunt added child severe mental health problems find child instead getting treated nhs ends police cell terrible thing child also bad police well want stop intrigued announcements since theresa may conservative government general previously given indication interest introducing completely new mental health legislation i waited see detail would conservative party manifesto encouragingly new bill first mentioned page britain described burning injustices tackled overcome first new mental health bill thirty years put parity esteem heart treatment end stigma mental illness page mental health bill referred beginning promise address need better treatments across whole spectrum mental health conditions manifesto goes state also reform outdated laws ensure mental illness treated fairly employers fulfil responsibilities effectively current mental health operate put community treatment order difficult discharged sectioning often used detain rather treat families information loved ones severely curtailed parents last learn son daughter sectioned introduce first new mental health bill thirty five years putting parity esteem heart treatment er detail found first thought wonder earth decided point time introduce new mental health second thought wonder prime minister health secretary could display large amount ignorance legislation direct responsibility conservative government well lack understanding actual content existing legislation let look statements far made introduce first new mental health bill thirty five years long ago labour government promising introduce new mental health bill first draft published june among things contained controversial proposal allowed detention people described dangerous severe personality disorder dspd also removed requirement patients treatment likely alleviate prevent deterioration patient condition could lead people diagnosis dspd detained indefinitely without committed offences supporting dangerousness surprisingly would almost definitely breached human rights part dropped future drafts culmination years consultation drafting eventually produced mental health basically extensively amended existing mental health well making changes comply human rights reflect cultural changes recognising sex partners civil partnership introduced community treatment orders approved mental health professionals i guess basis broke fix considered large part still perfectly workable essentially current mental health years old years old even years old since even years old theresa may conservatives appear forgotten new law finally confronts discrimination unnecessary detention takes place often also appear forgotten introduced make necessary changes mental health legislation incorporate changes case law arising result necessity comply human rights legislation including discrimination unnecessary detention seems disingenuous suggesting address especially conservative government long ago keen abolish human rights case i think amhps without exception would consider insulting suggest habitually detain patients unnecessarily heart amhp practice first principle always seek least restrictive option child severe mental health problems find child instead getting treated nhs ends police cell terrible thing child jeremy hunt appears unaware existence policing crime amends mental health well reducing maximum period detention also introduces new principally states child may removed kept taken place safety police station would therefore extremely undesirable child age detained police station actually illegal problem yet entered statute section due become law month delayed calling general election i heard plans enact july assuming conservatives returned power i help wondering simply forgotten fallout general election settled although i certain inspector michael brown obe would best ensure timetable adhered new safeguards people mental health problems capacity refuse consent treatment never treated sectioning often used detain rather treat two statements appear contradict capacity never issue comes making decisions mha never actually explicitly mentioned mha people may legally detained treated even deemed capacity objecting i think circumstances capacitous person may need receive treatment despite objection i sure patients would best served making impossible i even understand second statement means detention mha order treat designed assess one would detained simply hold without assessment treatment hospital families information loved ones severely curtailed parents last learn son daughter sectioned i somewhat perplexed meaning statement talking children parents integral part assessment process i find inconceivable probably illegal parent parental responsibility would deeply involved decisions relating child must also remember children deemed competence regard making decisions treatment may contravene right privacy certain circumstances consult relatives case nearest relative child certain well defined exceptions designed safeguard rights patient would law need informed patient detained i conclude analysis without pointing least complaints theresa may makes deficiencies current mha due deficiency existing legislation rather due cutbacks services loss significant percentage inpatient mental health beds last years well loss thousands frontline mental health professionals coincidentally time conservatives power compounded severe cutbacks local authorities make providing social care includes withdrawal funding voluntary organisations provide services people mental health problems well rationing social care consequence care cut back beds services provide alternatives hospital admission still expect mental health continue function efficiently course theresa may recognise change existing mental health law would subject process consultation interested parties consultation took years drafted may change existing law within lifetime next parliament course lot depends happens th june
