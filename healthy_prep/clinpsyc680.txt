acnp report efficacy closer look begin series antidepressants efficacy safety point focus predominantly youth change time let begin american college neuropsychopharmcology report focusing primarily conclusions commentary surrounding efficacy antidepressants depressed youth acnp report evidence mounted suggesting ssri linked suicidal ideation youth acnp decided analyze data issue provide report efficacy safety medications treating depression children adolescents many may seen acnp issued preliminary report followed final report march access like concluded fluoxetine prozac safe efficacious treatment youth depression indeed evidence support idea tads study discussed later though study serious methodological shortcomings weaken conclusions however indeed curious fluoxetine would lone medication show efficacy youth depression given strong chemical similarity ssris curious conclusion acnp authors believe data suggest ssri action combined absence pharmacologic effects noradrenergic system crucial antidepressant effect children adolescents tricylcic antidepressants new generation non ssri antidepressants therefore recommended first line treatment depressed youth p curious let me get straight data show ssris sertraline zoloft citalopram celexa paroxetine paxil yield responses range slightly superior placebo superior placebo somehow must specific ssri action trick trick medications efficacious placebo authors trying describe ssri effective placebo conflicts interest well fortunately i think i answer initial acnp report ghostwritten hat tip timothy scott one ethical human psychology psychiatry summer agency called gymr final report acknowledge use firm course mean firm assist preparation instead acknowledges help miriam davis indeed accomplished medical writer like virtually authors task force report appears received significant funding pharmaceutical companies various times across board conflicts interest mammoth ten eleven authors reported receiving funding pharmaceutical companies explanation failed studies one point acnp report authors attempt explain away studies compared medication placebo found significant advantage medication negative study without effective comparator i study comparing drug placebo fails prove effectiveness test medication prove drug effective without active comparator possible determine whether study failed drug ineffective study sample treatment resistant placebo responsive depression transient study design optimal terms dose duration treatment primary outcome measure commonly sample size small detect effect p arguments fallacious logic show drug effective significantly superior placebo show ineffective significantly superior placebo sounds like two different sets rules me i throwing bullshit flag beside ridiculous double standard mentioned let go point point treatment resistant drug effective effectively treat people depression treatment resistant drug approved marketed non treatment resistant depression course true samples may difficult others one simply claim oh people difficult patients fault work placebo responsive planet earth acnp news depression general quite placebo responsive look meta analyses kirsch et al need confirmation vast majority antidepressant drug effect replicated placebo small amount improvement drug treatment patients remains accounting placebo effect may explained medication side effects tipping trial participants fact medication thus enhances response moncrieff depression transient ok one hand excuse failure treatment sample treatment resistant hand say depression serious enough transient drug efficacious placebo sample either chronic resistant depressed seriously enough well certainly cake eating dose duration solid evidence tying dose response ssri depression would fair argument absence evidence meager excuse granted three week study seems bit short studies mentioned acnp report weeks reasonably expect medication outshine inert placebo within two three months primary outcome measure fortunately one acnp ers graham emslie would expert topic fluoxetine submitted fda approval pediatric depression interesting flip flop primary outcome measure emslie mind lead author one studies submitted fda approval quote fda review responder analysis based dr emslie original primary efficacy variable i recovery rate result significant fluoxetine treated group placebo p analysis based remission also significant p result significant based percent responder defined cgi improvement scores p note dr emslie paper percent responders defined cgi improvement presented primary result p emphases bold emslie team submitted fda primary outcome measure study fluoxetine showed superiority variable simply fished variable reached significance proclaimed primary outcome variable i agree principle measures examined considered i find ironic acnp decided play primary outcome measure card one report authors caught altering primary outcome variable small sample size ok finally fair point made however let keep mind point meta analyses review articles examine findings across studies indicate body literature say certain topic fortunately rather excellent meta analysis done topic finding significant benefit medication placebo depressed youth full text jureidini et al another good meta analysis whittington colleagues suggested moderate benefit fluoxetine ssri found ineffective though clearly weighed possibility increased suicidality forthcoming topic part day two
