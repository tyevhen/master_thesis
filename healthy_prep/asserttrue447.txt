science today huge problem way many people publishing way many results way positive problem imaginary speculative rampant well documented literature surveys repeatedly uncovered statistically unlikely preponderance statistically significant positive findings medicine see reference biology ecology psychology economics sociology positive findings findings support hypothesis likely submitted publication likely accepted publication also published quicker negative ones addition results presented initially abstracts eventually within years published published tend positive evidence higher prestige journals least ones get cited often publish research reporting greater effect sizes problem positive results reported knowledge hidden false picture reality presented false picture effectiveness particular drugs treatment options lack informed decision making health care serious issue since lives stake even lives stake theories go awry hypothesis verified one experiment yet refuted another experiment goes unpublished nothing found another reason reporting negative findings pressing problem meta analyses systematic literature reviews increasingly common important tool
