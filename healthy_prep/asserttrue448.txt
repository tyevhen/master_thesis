double blind randomized control trial rct gold standard clinical research last fifty years double blind rct might well called aluminum standard lead standard blinds regularly broken relatively studies ask participants end middle study whether able guess treatment arm placebo versus active treatment studies surprising many patients clinicians half double blind fact easily able guess group one double blind study rabkin et al psychiatry research vol issue september pp depression sufferers divided groups given placebo imipramine tricyclic antidepressant phenelzine monoamine oxidase inhibitor six weeks end study patients doctors asked guess groups patients doctors correctly guessed whether dealing placebo medicine authors say clinical outcome treatment condition interaction contributed guessing accuracy medication experience side effects assessed week accuracy high however even cases stratified clinical outcome indicating cues available patients doctors may include patterns timing side effects clinical response detectable end point analysis another double blind study reported margraf et al journal consulting clinical psychology vol pp involved panic disorder patients got either placebo imipramine alprazolam xanax halfway study four weeks patients physicians asked guess taking among patients taking active drug guessed taking active drug placebo patients guessed taking placebo unusual considering drugs involved xanax especially strong strongly therapeutic specific disorder studied panic disorder interesting physicians subject effects drugs also guessed correctly high rate imipramine alprazolam placebo effectively rendering study single blind rather double blind trial imipramine patients able discriminate imipramine alprazolam higher rate xanax users among subjects got imipramine guessed imipramine alprazolam patients guessed correctly could argued guessing whether taking anxiolytic really hard drugs like caffeine nicotine hand subtle effects shown high rates placebo responsiveness studies effects people hearts race get jittery etc give decaf tell regular coffee would important look kinds studies kinds arguably mooney et al paper addictive behaviors reported results meta analysis double blind nicotine replacement therapy studies studies analyzed participants able guess treatment assignments rates significantly chance even true patch therapies nicotine released slowly bloodstream long period time blind breakage potentially damaging credibility study especially damaging studies placebo response intrinsically high drug efficacy slight even slight boost perceived efficacy blind penetration hugely affect results well known patients expect positive results treatment tend experience positive outcomes often whether placebo drug patients expect negative results effect make low efficacy drug appear efficacious actually blind broken irving kirsch others called enhanced placebo effect kirsch invokes enhanced placebo effect explain effectiveness antidepressants owe efficacy ordinary placebo effect effectiveness kirsch says comes drug action enhanced placebo effect patients antidepressant studies begin notice side effects like sexual dysfunction gastrointestinal trouble know getting active drug tend respond better knowledge greenberg et al meta analysis antidepressant studies subject stricter blinding requirements typical double blind rct rigorously controlled arm studies placebo control arm two active treatment arms one including new drug study one including older reference medication authors came away three conclusions direct quotes effect sizes quite modest approximately one half one quarter size previously reported transparent conditions effect sizes based clinician outcome ratings significantly larger based patient ratings patient ratings revealed advantage antidepressants beyond placebo effect done blind breakage problem advocated using study design three even four arms placebo active placebo reference drug new drug even five arms include wait list group gets absolutely nothing whose progress nonetheless monitored actually proposed backing correct guessers data entirely studies conducted others suggested giving active drug surreptitiously patient even know getting anything brings ethical issues informed consent potentially also concept triple blindness drug companies adopted interesting approach pre study identify placebo responders eliminate actual study also irving kirsch suggested two two matrix design consisting placebo control groups split two arms one totally blind deliberately misinformed placebo receivers told gotten active drug active drug receivers told gotten placebo excellent paper even et al british journal psychiatry authors present seven point blindness assessment protection checklist bapc recommend researchers provide bapc analysis part published papers opinion degree blindness measurable researchers least measure disclose part study purported blinded otherwise researchers clinicians academics students lay public truly operating blind
