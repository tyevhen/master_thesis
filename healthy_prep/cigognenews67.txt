explain many ills afflicting man mankind theoretical framework helps understand psychology individual also dynamics referred sick society primal therapy helps unravel mysteries personal neuroses also sheds light monstrous forces frequently shock public repeatedly cry explanation primal perspective informs essays dr janov written collection behind every commentary critique lies deep understanding human mind works twisted distorted physical abuse emotional deprivation childhood followed dr janov work years primal context essays taken granted might say speak primal language degree essays stand

subconscious freudian sense dark violent depth avoided primal subconscious filled pain unfulfilled need unfelt feelings childhood leads another main pillar primal theory repression familiar way brain represses awareness traumatic events adulthood severe car crashes violent sexual assaults victims often say remember everything moment catastrophic event event clearly mind capable blocking awareness extremely painful experiences protect organism true traumatic events childhood human brain capable burying painful memories along feelings attached memories way protecting individual unbearable realization vulnerable children exposed abuse neglect realization represents threat system i loved repression survival mechanism allows child encapsulate bury awareness traumatic experiences painful take stage growth much new scientific research illuminates neurological way happens including methylation purposes need understand traumatic memories feelings blocked awareness time take place thus repressed memories laid layered time creating levels consciousness corresponding stage individual development primal therapy three levels consciousness inter connected via memories feelings first level consciousness call first line earliest level corresponding pre verbal experiences infancy including birth second level second line encompasses experiences childhood include emotional responses

catastrophic events unconscious normal neurotic generally aware feelings reactions level though may understand feel certain way given situations extreme cases however even awareness feeling may blocked third line although subconscious levels still driving behavior present case psychopathic killers feel nothing committing horrible deeds witnesses often describe mass murderers acting calmly blank looks even smile lower level rage drives murderous impulses buried consciousness killers later confess know important corollary theory three levels conscious notion resonance idea similar feelings connected across levels consciousness present past back present resonance crucial clinical settings provides vehicle patients follow feeling present led back similar inter connected feelings past neurologically speaking three levels consciousness correspond structure triune brain broadly speaking evolves three stages thus first line feelings registered earliest primitive parts brain

feelings past drive actions thoughts emotions present without even knowing divided self repressed memories painful feelings simply buried consciousness forgotten remain powerful force within individual constantly pushing resolution repression produces divided self conscious versus unconscious split creates constant state conflict tension resolved making self whole means bringing

traumatic experiences without resolution force old buried feelings continues impact person personality take toll health repression might keep neurotic comfortably unaware demons inside pressure system eventually lead cancer heart disease dementia body breaks speak stress holding much back time order work effectively repression requires defenses defenses built system naturally bio chemicals produced body help create gating system keeps traumatic memories unconscious allowing people become functional adults cases however pain great damages weakens natural gates bringing pain closer surface thus making person suffer often people come primal therapy pain breaking desperately need way resolve others may turn drugs alcohol soothe suffering risking lifetime addiction since unresolved pain always
