genome leprosy bacterium mycobacterium leprae stands remarkable example dna apparent state massive wholesale breakdown organism genes appear functional pseudogenes say genes turned left dead genes become pseudogenes number ways including loss start codon loss promoter regions degraded shine dalgarno signals random insertions deletions mutations cause spurious stop codons gene gets turned assuming loss gene question fatal gene typically undergoes period degradation leading eventual loss genome exactly see leprosy bacterium leprosy germs medieval skeletons sampled genomes sequenced researchers found pseudogenes leprae changed much past thousand years leprae tend hold onto pseudogenes actively transcribes upwards probably transcripts result expressed proteins many lack start codon doubt get translated proteins let put way would extremely unusual organism conserve many pseudogenes none anything useful view segment two genomes shows region around base pairs tuberculosis maps similar base pair region leprae notice lowermost panel representing leprae many genes shown shrunken silver segments instead fat green cylinders smaller grey silver segments pseudogenes click enlarge get better idea going i downloaded dna sequences leprae normal genes well pseudogenes analyzing codons genes i looked signs genes still normal reading frame one way detect measuring purine content various base positions gene codons typical protein coding gene around codons begin adenine guanine positional bias course lost gene undergone frameshift mutations among leprae pseudogenes i found codons showed average ag percentage content codon base one pseudogenes appear still mostly frame things get lot interesting putative membrane proteins concerned previous post i showed genes second codon base pyrimidine rich i predominantly cytosine thymine genes encode proteins high percentage nonpolar amino acids bottom line gene codons mostly second position gene likely encodes membrane associated protein see previous post data true organisms viruses cells organellar genes way leprae generic feature genetic code i segregated leprae pseudogenes according whether second codon base average less purines i stumbled onto something quite interesting i found pseudogenes ag less meaning probably membrane associated proteins still frame ag contrast majority non membrane pseudogenes ag appear turned average ag long story short non membrane associated pseudogenes frame likely dead whereas putative membrane associated pseudogenes appear frame therefore could still functional least undead looking stop codons i found pseudogenes still stop codons average distance first stop codon bases whereas average pseudogene length bases pseudogenes putative membrane associated proteins shorter overall membrane proteins often bases instead average distance first stop codon bases significantly longer pseudogenes suggests still alive probably wondering heck pseudogene possible use whatsoever contains premature stop codon thing need ask though leprae tolerates indeed conserves many pseudogenes first place could organism adapted frameshift tolerant translation apparatus maybe stop codons really stop codons know wide variety organisms viruses phenomenon first discovered bacteria eukaryotes evolved special signals tell ribosomes shift frame plus

codon decoding making possible special frameshift signals work signals usually involve base long slippery heptamer sequences ccctgac right stop codon tga appears words stop codon appears inside slippery heptamer really stop codon depending kinds amounts trnas duty frameshift signal i looked ccctgac leprae pseudogenes i found frame occurrences sequence pseudogenes occurrences hexamer ccctga found frame leprae normal genes prove leprae unusual translation tricks tantalizing result also bear mind leprae indeed unusual tricks may well using frameshift signals addition ccctgac fact mycobacterium species lack muts mutl mismatch repair system means leprae may adapted different ways coping slippery repeats work needed confirm whether leprae indeed translates pseudogenes proteins
