paper mit engineer stephanie seneff near i tell couple medical research reading renegades published european journal internal medicine earlier year remarkable see one presumes major european biomedical journal publish something outsiders amazing still easily understandable well referenced cogent understanding lipoproteins metabolism brain chemistry specialty journals often get shallow papers peck single organ system without holistic understanding physiology ado let dive i going summarize best bits paper i strongly encourage read paper link full text version available seneff website mit alzheimer dementia disease i blogged extensively degenerative disease characterized nerve cell death plaques tangles linked insulin resistance diabetes low cholesterol millions dollars several decades spent chasing obvious pathology plaques tangles innovative humans invented sorts marvelously clever treatments including vaccines plaque drugs interfere plaque synthesis problems vaccines good trials plaque busting drug halted early due obvious accelerated deterioration cognition treatment group compared placebo based controls seems typical response failures think oh acting early enough busting enough plaques might case seneff crew suggest quite astutely amyloid beta proteins form plaques might good reason protective reason cover alzheimer brain ferocity know strong correlation insulin resistance early alzheimer also association mitochondrial dysfunction particularly complex alzheimer i discussed basic science energy everything brain efficiency mitochondria happy brain happy mitochondrial dysfunction also implicated parkinson disease als long term ultimately fatal degenerative conditions point i made low cholesterol suicide brain relatively small body cholesterol cholesterol insulates neurons part myelin sheath provides scaffold neural network important part membranes synapses much cholesterol used brain made brain clear evidence apolipoprotein apoe big player game shuttling cholesterol fat antioxidants central nervous system body main cholesterol factory liver apoe made nerve cells called astrocytes tend feed neurons apoe allows astrocytes suck lipids antioxidants cholesterol arriving ldl idl particles bloodstream yes astrocytes transport ldl across blood brain barrier biggest genetic risk alzheimer carrier certain type apoe gene called apoe research shown apoe associated reduced cholesterol uptake astrocytes confusing lipophobic medical establishment apoe associated high ldl cholesterol must nasty horrible ldl killing brain key bit understand ldl cholesterol longitudinal studies tends drop development alzheimer disease hmmm ca ignore following tantalizing clue either high cholesterol level positively correlated longevity people years old cases shown associated better memory function reduced dementia cerebrospinal fluid alzheimer disease patients substantially depleted lipoproteins cholesterol triglycerides free fatty acids compared matched controls especially readers since removed blog post part venus gate paleo disruption weeks ago supposed dangers densely packed saturated fat understanding lipoproteins work lipoproteins hdl ldl chylomicrons vldl basically look like image wikipedia lipoproteins carry fats delicacies blood blood dangerous filled nasty things like oxygen iron break gentle fats want fats oxidized lipoproteins tuck fats inside keep safe snuggly major reason particular structure lipoproteins keep fats safe exposed blood fats delivered cell membranes still want keep safe cholesterol like bit plate armor helps fats stack tightly protecting oxidative damage invading microbial pathogens seneff et al continue stack evidence paper dietary avoidance fat replaced carbohydrate increasingly zealous prescriptions cholesterol lowering medication coincided rise alzheimer dementia diabetes obesity correlations one might consider evidence favor plausible hypothesis stripping brain cholesterol especially oxidative hyperglycemic environment could lead sick neurons sick neurons darndest go forward despite growing burden oxidative damage smokey spewing mitochondria end damaged thing call immune system send self destruct signals amyloid beta proteins come hypothesized try stand cholesterol help shift cell using damaged mitochondria utilizing different sources cell cytoplasm make energy biochem nerds specifically glucose redirected pentose shunt anaerobic pathway generating nadph also protect cell oxidation purpose reduce ongoing damage last stand prior self destruction neurons cells ultimately give ghost defensive forces left place crystallize form famous plaques seneff elegantly puts legacy complex protein debris left place back insulin resistance hyperglycemia legacy turn processed carbohydrate inflammatory fructose intensive western diets turns apolipoproteins critical functioning cholesterol machinery also particularly vulnerable damage called glycation high glucose environment glycation known disturb uptake apoe astrocytes first step processing cholesterol used brain diabetics apo higher risk alzheimer thought less efficient apoe combined detrimental effects glycation could reason enter ketogenic diet pilot study found therapuetic alzheimers involves extremely high fat diet supplying plenty brain results brain able use alternative energy sources ketones skip damaged mitochondrial complex also tend lower insulin resistance eliminate glycation blood sugar low enter pathogens excess glucose advanced glycolation end products floating around blood diabetics vulnerable bacterial infection average person alzheimer dementia also associated infection certain chronic pathogens including pylori chlamydia pneumoniae plausible mechanisms infections increase inflammation oxidative damage hastening onset dementia learned eat processed carbs ketones fat friends avoid inflammation foster immune system resistance infection protect brain scariest scenario well diabetics higher risk heart disease least aggressively statinized especially last years would considered malpractice primary care doc cardiologist encourage statin use diabetic whiff high cholesterol seems quite plausible drastically reducing cholesterol combination hyperglycemia diabetes perfect storm developing alzheimer dr steve parker noted study showed increase alzheimer autopsies diabetics study done japan strong evidence fact plain old type ii diabetes would cause alzheimer japan general lower cholesterol levels japanese low cholesterol known coincide stroke risk addition study done mostly mainstream statin explosion united states anyway i know aggressively japanese diabetics treated high cholesterol i wonder differences processed food burden along cholesterol lowering drugs explain difference strong epidemiological evidence linking insulin resistance diabetes alzheimer western world lack relationship diabetes alzheimer japanese study well better figure soon dementia growing expected triple next years figure i gon na go eat coconut oil
