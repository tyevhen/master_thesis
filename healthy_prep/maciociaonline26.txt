previous clinical tip i discussed clinical application cosmological sequence elements i one placing elements form cross i concentrated vertical relationship fire water heart kidneys clinical tip i discuss clinical significance earth centre wood metal left right respectively earth centre placing earth centre cosmological sequence elements crucial earth centre cosmological clinical sense four elements fire water wood metal placed along square fire top south water bottom north wood left east metal right west square centre point reference pertains earth top bottom left right reference centre placing earth centre completely lost sheng cycle elements earth fire metal saw previous clinical tip sheng ke cycle introduced zou yan strong political significance clinical perspective placing earth centre many applications first spleen origin post natal blood nourishes organs therefore make sense earth centre point view movement stomach spleen centre another sense middle burner upper burner lower burner every organ certain direction movement example heart lung descend kidney descends stomach spleen middle movement influences movements stomach descends spleen ascends organs depend partially two movements stomach spleen movement disrupted middle affect upper lower burners clinical perspective tonifying stomach spleen tonifies centre therefore organs i use st zusanli sp sanyinjiao usually moxa needle simple extremely effective treatment tonifies stomach spleen blood organs wood left metal right following article journal chinese medicine zhong yi za zhi beijing reading article i explain meaning mechanism ji mechanism term includes ascending descending entering exiting every organ every part body ascends descends essential aspect physiology every organ example middle burner stomach descends spleen ascends apart ascending descending physiology also includes entering exiting less well known aspect movement ascending descending represents vertical movement entering exiting represents horizontal movement example cou li space superficial space skin muscles wei circulates goes aspect entering exiting su wen chapter says without exiting entering would birth growth maturity decline without ascending descending would birth growth transformation receiving storage organs rely ascending descending exiting entering entering exiting plays important role transformation transportation excretion fluids liver diseases forget treat lungs journal chinese medicine zhong yi za zhi p lungs govern regulates functions zangfu lungs function jie zhi means control check moderate means lungs restrict regulate functions zangfu lung descends communicates kidney water lung function restricting regulating adjusting functions zangfu dependant descending lung ascending descending liver normally ascends makes mechanism work smoothly blood harmonized flow freely saying states ascending stems liver lin pei qin lungs called tender organ governs descends lung descend situation rebellious causing cough ye tian shi said liver left rises lung right descends also said mechanism body mirrored heaven earth nature liver left rises lung right descends lung descend liver rebels horizontally therefore ascending liver descending lung essential correct functioning ascending descending mechanism moreover ascending descending regulates smooth flow mechanism please note physiological ascending liver liver yang rising pathological conditions liver rises much impairs descending lung therefore leads situation left ascending much right descending enough leads cough headache red eyes spitting blood epistaxis etc liver stagnates rise enough lung also stagnates leads breathlessness feeling oppression chest constipation urinary retention etc conversely lung pathologies affect liver lung descend properly could lead heat impairs free flow liver leads cough hypochondrial chest pain distension fullness dizziness headache etc therefore reciprocal control regulation liver lungs essential smooth function mechanism descending diffusing lung controlling regulating adjusting actions rising liver reflects also element control wood metal clinical application many liver pathologies necessary regulate treat lung strengthening diffusing descending lung two effects one hand controls heat restoring normal ascending descending hand frees passages triple burner water dampness transformed liver store blood descending lung subdues rebellious liver conditions emotional stress leading stagnation liver loses free flow channel flow smoothly rise upwards harass heart lungs stagnant turns heat rises lung fails descend leads cough breathlessness chest pain dizziness headache etc hence saying liver pathology forget treat lungs herbs make lung descend include xing ren chuan bei mu xuan fu hua su zi hai ge ke etc rebels upwards heat use herbs huang qin sang bai pi qian hu dou ling etc fire rises upwards chronic situations lungs suffer dryness use sha shen mai men dong shi hu pi pa ye etc lung fails descend liver ascends much formula xie bai san addition cooling blood clearing liver heat herbs restore normal flow using high dose sang bai pi regulate mechanism order relieve stagnation liver conditions stagnation liver emotional problems besides using herbs move eliminate stagnation one must also pay attention making lung descend keep check ascending regulate mechanism promote smooth flow triple burner herbs include pi pa ye xing ren chuan bei mu zi wan time use herbs promote diffusing lung huang jie geng gua luo pi etc stagnation lung given rise phlegm one must clear upper burner treat lung herbs pi pa ye xing ren gua luo pi yu jin ban xia fu ling sheng jiang zhu li etc
