fist pumping bright sparkly eye admiring general back slapping inaugural ancestral health symposium last weekend world academia rolled cool evolutionary psychiatry type papers published today entry reviews neat paper favorite journal brain behavior immunity omega supplementation lowers inflammation anxiety medical students randomized controlled trial somehow i missed pre conference hoopla usual jamie johnny spot emailed me link thinks i nerd paper combines lot positives randomized controlled trial using actual blood metrics plasma ratios pbmc ratios along measurements inflammatory cytokines completely stupid placebo many rcts omega supplementation mental health use soybean oil olive oil placebos throw huge question mark results may mental health effects let begin interesting stuff introduction inflammation related sorts bad mojo like heart disease autoimmune disease stroke mental illness populations eat fish tend suffer less diseases felt omega pufas fish may protective inflammation epidemiological data observational studies shown higher fish dha epa intake associated lower incidence depressive disorders non psychiatrically ill psychiatrically ill populations randomized controlled trials omega supplementation mixed results overall trend improving clinical depression necessarily sub clinical depressed mood data anxiety disorders less robust lower omega plasma levels found folks social anxiety two small rcts supplementation anxiety also mixed results important know anxiety depression associated increase pro inflammatory cytokines commonly measured ones il tnfalpha roughly info visit anastasia latest post omega fatty acids become anti inflammatory cytokines omega fatty acids become inflammatory cytokines always biochemistry whole story work purposes today therefore increasing omega help reduce inflammation goes theory favorite grumpy belgian dr maes cool paper showing medical students worse ie higher serum ratios higher increases inflammatory markers lps tnfalpha exam times interesting let see happens medical students today paper course years several cohorts total medical students aged men women randomized either omega supplement mg epa mg dha i think omegabrite supplement sold harvard psychiatrist andy stoll i think led grand rounds i know personally placebo placebo mixture palm olive soybean canola coco butter oils meant mimic standard fatty acid ratios consumed adults placebo also fish flavoring added keep experiment blinded supplementation went weeks total data collected critically day major exams several months supplementation discontinued fatty acid ratios studied interesting way first straight plasma levels measured levels measured inflammation stimulated cultures peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs like lymphocytes que well reservoir active omega omega precursors inflammatory anti inflammatory response housed cell membranes stimulate immune cells inflammatory signal typically lps used start spitting cytokines response level inflammatory response depending upon raw omega omega materials experiment straight omega omega ratio blood measured simulated omega omega inflammatory anti inflammatory immune response kinda neat right results impressive students completed trial med students dutiful habitual fish eaters anyone omega supplementation inflammation modulating medication supplement regimen excluded along anyone health problems smokers beginning levels omega dha epa across groups third blood draw plasma levels epa dha fold fold higher experimental group controls levels pmbcs fold fold higher controls inflammatory response anxiety levels students supplementation reduced levels il tnfalpha experimental group anxiety scores low across groups measured times also decreased experimental group change amount inflammation exam time unlike previous maes study researchers found results pretty exciting especially young healthy population average ratio baseline quite bit lower population averages though markedly higher cordain estimates hunter gatherers baseline levels il tnfalpha medical students lower population average baseline intake epa dha students higher national age peers even though medical students better ratios less simmering inflammation general population perhaps poor choice particular study omegabrite intervention significantly decreased inflammatory response changes might marked typical american population indeed previous randomized controlled trials omega pufa supplementation rather consistently produced decreased inflammation elderly diabetics folks high triglycerides study first one show anxiolytic effects omega supplementation population without baseline anxiety depression scores like anxiety scores low baseline affected concordance large body evidence showing omega pufa supplementation effective clinical sub clinical depression paper ends interesting discussion safety omega fatty acid supplementation low amounts increase hemorrhagic stroke bleeding time even combination aspirin epidemiologic studies show decreased risk dying pneumonia reduction post surgical infections much lower risk thrombotic stroke folks eat fish fda deems doses grams per day marine pufas generally recognized safe medical students daily epa dha equals less anxiety less inflammation everyone else might benefit even since know taste fish rotten i hope i think safest get fish oil fish wild caught sourced carefully avoid pcbs heavy metals safer still limit easily oxidized pufas diet minimal requirements need big omega post found brain omega biochem nerds want check paper omega heavy hitter artemis simopoulos
