far linked zinc deficiency anorexia adhd depression meaning patients conditions tendency lower serum zinc levels people without anorexia depression human studies preliminary case depression shown supplementation helpful data anorexia robust recommended daily supplementation treatment anorexia nervosa mg day touch normal rda upper tolerable limit officially defined mg day low level toxicity related problems copper absorption metabolism demonstrated consistent supplementation mg daily however one likely run problems mg day eaton et al via nora gedgaudas says paleolithic daily intake zinc around mg daily many different formulations zinc consistent evidence population level one formulation better another readily absorbed fortunately labeling supposed account indicating amount elemental zinc actually get take supplement since nasal formulations cause permanent loss smell avoided though general mineral supplement contains mg says rda actual rda varies age circumstance mg adult men mg breastfeeding moms vegetarians may need supplementation meat eaters people thiazide diuretics hctz example high blood pressure may need actual mechanisms zinc related links psychopathology remain obscure though looking closely variety functions zinc modulates body many could play clarify finding zinc necessary formation il yet zinc deficiency associated high levels il levels depression literature people depressed tend low serum zinc high il i going leave zinc behind though without touching upon one rather obscure paper published online neurochemical research june title zinc fatty acids depression really think i could go another post without mentioning omega paper poorly written experimental methods issues something likable despite flaws researchers took blood samples zinc levels fatty acids obtained gas chromatography fats within serum rather red blood cell membrane fraction i used seeing usually i see centrifuge mentioned rbc fraction measurements i see one used measurements like bmi standard clinical psychiatric interviews couple standard rating rating scales depression hamilton beck psychiatric inpatients inpatients antidepressants surprisingly oddly enough blood drawn overnight fasting quasi empty bowel cup herb tea without sugar slice white bread controls convenient group volunteers recruited population matched age group gender overnight fasting period blood sample taken prepared chemical analysis similar conditions patients samples i sure means got herb tea slice bread oh well find first big difference levels zinc patients controls among depressed people depressed beck depression inventory lower zinc level medication study seemed relation zinc fatty acid concentration prior study antidepressant medication normalized zinc levels also actual dha epa fish oil levels depressed individuals controls ratios omega born arachidonic acid serum dha epa significantly correlated amount depression symptoms meaning depressed patients whack ratio omega omega sounding familiar nifty findings make yo go hmmm control subjects higher zinc levels higher levels myristic acid type saturated fat people depressed higher amounts stearic acid another saturated fat observational study get get ponder discussion results researchers throw something entirely unexpected really i like paper suddenly start rambling skeletons right blue zn demonstrated contribute stabilize skeleton i even sure means depressive disorders density bone minerals found low antidepressants reported beneficial effect bone cells go talk arachidonic acid hufa created omega pufas dha enriched diets given specific ratio reduced zinc content piglets femurs found already zinc metabolism complicated appears me found sink body store zinc sequester circulation bones possible signal get body store release zinc bones omega omega ratio osteoporosis demineralization bones highly linked depression another disease civilization let look zinc sink already saw previous post inflammatory cytokine il seemed help tuck zinc away liver turns livers zinc deficient rats high amount myristic acid changes mrna protein messaging systems transporters responsible fatty acid metabolism study linear relationship amount zinc blood amount myristic acid blood sure means definitely something remember future reference finally turns enzymes change omega acids arachidonic acid used complex signaling throughout body zinc dependent absolute zinc deficiency high amount sequestered zinc due control inflammation could cause lot changes along omega fatty acid metabolism pathway let examine areas zinc plays major roll inflammation immunity brain particularly hippocampus ground zero depression liver ground zero metabolism pancreatic beta cells bones ca get terribly excited zinc plays role many chemical reactions body course find important areas related diseases civilization i mean zinc even helps hair formation i gray hairs prior starting paleo eating seem coming back i read evolutionary medicine forum anecdotal evidence gray hair reversal lot learn even known excess insulin always starring role whole metabolic picture diseases civilization full screen view involves pufa ratios zinc i doubt
