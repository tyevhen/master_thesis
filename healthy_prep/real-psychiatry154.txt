always interesting phenomenon see headline grabbing news toxic psychiatric medications killing people first cult news days seems people make fairly good living knowledge psychiatry clinical experience never prerequisite always requires reader suspend sense reality know happens real life reality family member neighbor friend serious problems saw psychiatrist got better also requires suspension belief tremendous history happens untreated psychotic disorders terms morbidity mortality finally requires suspension belief usual regulatory mechanisms many people dying treatment would obvious somebody would held accountable every state medical boards basically solicit complaints physicians surely group physicians prescribing inordinately toxic medication would come light suspend realities course none occurred despite reality factors number antipsychiatrists people claiming critics basically using rhetoric warning people toxicities many people killed medications year estimates astronomical suggest clear biased agenda actual community surveillance reveals accurate picture medications highest complication rates easily recognized psychiatrist primary care physician say medications prescribed psychiatrists perfectly safe i posted medical decision including one involves taking common medication risk free i spend good deal half time warning people side effects never happen warning people severe rare side effects managing side effects happen screening potential side effects might go unnoticed patient like electrocardiogram abnormalities blood tests specific bodily systems years practice i diagnosed severe problems including serotonin syndrome neuroleptic malignant syndrome prolonged qtc interval various degrees heart block arrhythmias myocardial infarctions strokes drug induced liver disease agranulocytosis diabetes mellitus diabetes insipidus hypo hyperthyroidism many either caused medication picked result screening medical complication pre screening safe use relative primary care number diagnoses psychiatric practice reason smaller significant cause mortality psychiatric populations cigarette smoke significant number medical conditions pre

mortality sensitivity analysis first episode patients showed decreased risk mortality exposure low moderate exposure antipsychotics increased mortality exposure moderate high dose benzodiazepines striking fact follow period cohort patients died patients first episode psychosis i treated otherwise healthy year olds illustrating significance problem excellent study number perspectives looks well defined data across population generally possible scandinavian populations contrast studies done typically look either incomplete retail pharmacy data designed originally pharmaceutical sales detailed health interview data based entirely self report using long detailed questionnaires study uses methodology suggested pharmacoepidemiological research follow period times atypical antipsychotic medications widely available drugs suggested source higher cardiovascular mortality psychiatric patients authors findings discussed light several studies show similar effects finding study come surprise acute care psychiatrists across reason psychiatrists cover settings despite hardships involved know treating difficult problems little assistance even absence continuum care successful psychiatrists also aware medication toxicity importantly article points identify high risk patients safely treat despite concerns metabolic effects atypical antipsychotic medication implication factors like smoking may significant development cardiovascular disease risk antidepressant antipsychotic medication seen appropriate context study lowering mortality rather causing study also provides useful guidance benzodiazepine use opinion benzodiazepines used briefly treatment catatonia acute agitation patients psychotic disorders used long terms basis i agree authors idea tolerance problem dose escalation fails results withdrawal panic attacks protracted insomnia risk impulsive behavior increasing depression much greater frequent primary care visits also occur due tolerance need dose escalation discussions appropriate use treating population united states problematic certain point people safely detoxified benzodiazepines inpatient unit services widely unavailable study blueprint quality assurance projects using methodology electronic health records ehr across country every clinical population examined using authors techniques followed outcomes active interventions reference provides opportunity see realistic risk benefits treatment people high risk psychiatric illness also presents opportunity use methodology provide better treatment people illness prescription profiles everywhere instead using ehr catalogue useless full text information track physicians authors methods used much finer tracking details like bmi blood pressure smoking status relevant
