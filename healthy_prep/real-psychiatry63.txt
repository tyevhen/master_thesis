past year i using transversed edges per second teps lectures neurobiology give rough estimate computing power human brain rougher estimate brain power compares artificial intelligence ai i finally found detailed information ai impacts web site wanted post future reference possibly generate interest topic psychiatrists i interested human computer comparisons since i gave grand rounds topic back back i interested bandwidth human brain trying calculate basic approach look major bus systems brain fiber counts try estimate much information passing bus engineering terms bus path computer processors use communicate devices processors rate communication passes pathway major limitation terms computing speed rate tasks transmitter peripheral devices engineers typically specify characteristics communication paths good example standard usb connectors computer today usb usb connectors usb devices support data transfer rate mbps mbs usb connection supports gbps mbs work i i looked major structures brain i considered bus like fascicles corpus callosum unfortunately many fiber count estimates structures turns neuroanatomists count fibers neurons ones exacting second issue information transfer rate fiber counts could established reliable estimate information contained spikes i fortunate time book came somewhat acclaimed time called spikes authors attempted calculate exact amount information spikes used fast fourier transform fft methodology i familiar quantitative eeg qeeg available data time i limited calculating bandwidth corpus callosum i used fiber axon count million turns corpus callosum heterogeneous bus large fibers using bit rate bits spiking neuron multiplied entire bus results total gbs i preliminary calculation realized i another white matter fiber tracts connecting lobes hemispheres limbic system i fiber counts structures top neuroanatomist world could help me i found interesting question posted coffee shop process investigating i found preliminary data group using calculation called tranversed edges per second teps showing least preliminary basis human brain currently calculating rate currently par supercomputers i found additional papers group week articles read understood anyone interesting read look authors basic assumptions well might wrong give rough estimates cases large error might assumptions wrong provide detailed references footnotes assumptions calculations basic model assumes human brain comprised interconnected nodes way supercomputer connects processors clusters processors basic pattern described situations brain details hard find also question level analysis nodes example large structures best choice many smaller networks nodes relevant analysis high performance computing hpc several bottlenecks anticipated nodes try connect one another including bus latency bus length cases smaller scale circuity delays processor ability scale divide signal without losing signal across several pathways also relevant purpose analysis authors use one estimated numbers neurons brain authors use figure synapses division yields synaptic connections neuron teps benchmark discussed detail graph web site performance metrics teps reference contains basic accessible definition time required perform breadth first search large random graph requiring propagating information across every edge graph

implications calculations accurate illustrate human brain performance limited node node communication like computers ai researchers physicians obvious taking nodes buses line progressively impact
