addresses mainly lower feeling centers paranoid ideas may disappear time would think attacking ideas head address underlying feelings safely integrated indeed patient verge deep heavy feeling may get paranoid transiently trying suffocate me know immediately comes treat post haste patients begin relive deep brain imprint paranoid ideas disappear self destructive people among destroying feeling self one pain destroying keeping destroying drinking oblivion seems self destructive person means keep pain control suicide self destructive behavior indeed two different things even though suicide attempts destroy self oddly self destructive suicide means one final anything present causes result deep memory yes one could screaming could help temporarily since would relieve pressure acts suicide cry help taking certain amount sleeping pills example others say i really want live anymore jump bridge final call help seems helpless hopeless want die relief pain enough theme song television series rings profound kernel truth suicide painless killing oneself meant self destructive per se meant kill pain come subsume self primal therapy get patients gradually deep feelings disturbing takes time get discover real relief kind lasts lets live
