i went urgent care today battling influenza like illness i got trip alaska likely flight home symptoms charted graphic without providing much graphic detail symptoms concern whether i might pneumonia needed chest ray although i knew likely influenza virus symptoms fairly severe example last saturday august i diffuse muscle pain severe i could barely move two days i took time work august muscle pain restricted chest wall muscles cough also become productive past days i thought reasonable get checked especially backdrop asthma chronic asthma therapy i took graphic along me showed nurse physician i told i bronchitis probably caused respiratory virus nurse overtly uninterested one point said needed single symptom write symptom would cough continued writing kept glancing graphic taking additional notes i wanted say scan stop writing contains almost information need know i i maintained standard medical office decorum seinfeld said go large waiting room smaller waiting room wait see doctor nurse took vitals including oxygen saturation stated matter factly normal enthusiastic reply good met dead air doctor walked i gave brief history looked graphic wrote words listened lung fields stethoscope listened heart sounds shirt entire history exam took minutes bronchitis probably lot inflammation i going prescribe prednisone antibiotic levaquin good one point i told i already two qtc interval prolonging drugs levaquin might good idea ok i look another antibiotic doxycyline one work yes interaction doxcycline medication questions i asked issue chest ray i three last two years seemed like decision coin toss i think sounds lungs one place particular get better i would chest ray right going change i i walked scripts doxycycline mg bid days prednisone mg qday days entire length visit rn md minutes i patient clinic course time i comparing topology medical visit medical care common uniformed criticisms psychiatric care morning totally blue somebody sent me link letter british medical journal fact clinical trials paroxetine unpublished sent response post i made time ago apparently unaware fact i figured paroxetine drug i cared prescribe time i prescribed second patient obvious unpublished clinical trials significant problem medicine time nothing new psychiatry seems like prevalent bias psychiatry rearing ugly head longstanding claim psychiatric diagnoses valid test test i got bronchitis course none diagnosis bronchitis pretty much depends symptoms i walked symptoms graphic seemed shunned rn casually interesting md none measurements office anything bronchitis essentially measures look whether i significant disease actually significant syndrome i intern thought scientific way analyze problem would obtain sputum samples gram stain samples culture integrity respiratory epithelium disrupted kinds bacteria colonize area sputum samples useful either terms pathogenesis guiding antibacterial therapy thirty years later antibacterial treatment bronchitis still empirical specific pathogen identified thinking used sputum indicated bacterial infection know sloughed epithelium cytotoxic effect viruses empirical treatment bronchitis really different empirical treatment symptom defined mental illness ignoring couple hundred specific respiratory viruses reminiscent hostile criticism psychiatric nomenclature one disease comparison acute bronchitis also one disease another interesting comparison symptom severity i spend lot time discussing documenting psychiatric disorders case bronchitis particular interest severity questions subjective experience patterns cough sputum production either course i know pattern recognition place physician looking signs significant illness like tachycardia tachypnea diaphoresis cyanosis questions functional capacity i affected info graphic psychiatric diagnosis treatment requires close attention severity impact functional capacity sleep whether symptoms remission evidence basis treatment charitable interpretation mail paroxetine would suggest author critical evidence basis use well known half drug studies clinicaltrials gov unpublished significant number published trials omit details interest like side effects study looked trials different medical specialties none psychiatry turns clinical trials adults acute bronchitis treated antibiotics less likely rated improved follow studies show shorter duration cough day trade significant increase antibiotic side effects emergency department visits adverse drug effects due antibiotics direct quote uptodate patients known asthma may develop superimposed acute bronchitis common patients seek treatment inappropriately prescribed antibiotic even though usually viral illness uptodate review also looks associated issues overprescription antibiotics year cdc initiative antibiotic overprescribing essentially failed dire consequences developing multiple antibiotic resistant bacterial strains purpose imply anything treatment illustrate practices common equivalent amount criticism similar targeted psychiatric care fact i wanted take role pseudopatient i could walk clinic emergency department walk prescriptions even absence acute bronchitis i could simply lie symptoms nobody going ask me sputum sample asthmatics residual wheezing picked cursory exam course would public outcry i would accused lying hard working physicians wasting time poorly conceived idea still cited evidence psychiatric diagnosis unlike unrealistic critics psychiatry goal embarrass anyone illustrate i better anyone nonpublication clinical trials paroxetine drug i prescribed years problem psychiatry nonpublication clinical trials obviously problem everyone poor quality current clinical trials technology problem everyone unlike cochrane database i see point exhaustive documentation predictable low quality results least much point i also attribute differences practice clinical trials art medicine problem analyzing huge amounts data biological systems widespread problems clinical trial design every area medicine analyze data contrary gold standard needs better stratification heterogenous diseases whether depression bronchitis specific treatments better characterized molecular pathology treatments target pathology includes markers would suggest patients would respond drug treatment would promising biomarker bronchitis treated antibiotics right widely studied widely available highlights post really changed since i began pointing psychiatry singled criticism various people various motivations looking facts
