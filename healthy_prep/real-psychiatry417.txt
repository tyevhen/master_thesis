eric kandel thought research writing major source inspiration me ever since i read neuroscience text classic article psychotherapy single synapse new england journal medicine nearly years ago i pleased see wrote lead article neuron th anniversary edition entitled new science mind future knowledge i read article spirit i read original nejm article guidance world class neuroscientist also trained psychiatrist level article quite exciting somewhere along line dr kandel clearly following concepts far removed synapse good job summarizing major points current deficiencies also comes back idea psychotherapy biological treatment proposed original article one interesting aspects article kandel apologize psychoanalysis also excessively critical i read article residency class harvard psychoanalysis certainly prominent time although fashionable days throw freud bus points freud subsequent analysts right number issues neuroscience caught including unconscious mental processes pervade conscious thought importance unconscious thought decision making adaptability probable link freud psychoanalysis current neuroscience focused mind rather descriptive psychiatry point majority field got sidetracked issue identifying small number pathological conditions objective criteria mind completely lost process psychiatrists focused engaged generating theories criticizes field lack empiricism recognizes changed clinical trials psychodynamic psychotherapy recent interest testing psychoanalytical theories available neuroscience also points aaron beck psychoanalyst developed cognitive behavior therapy focused conscious thought processes became leading proponent evidence based therapy good see discussion hard problem consciousness i assc listserv many years eventually lost home shut many experts consciousness studies posted thread little neuroscience involved plenty discussion neural correlates consciousness information flow brain always one interests idea information flows biological systems chemical electrical levels relatively recent concept clinical level behavioral neurologists like mesulam damasio discussed based cortical organization information flow primarily cortical levels i taught course many years talked basic information flow primary sensory cortex association cortex heteromodal cortices model good explanatory power number syndromes impacted organizational model example achromatopsia made sense lesion pure sensory cortex posterior aphasia made sense lesion heteromodal cortex using model overall information flow sensory motor output side could conceptualized plenty open boxes flowchart along way theory consciousness generated neural substrates still problem social behavior another despite decades descriptive psychiatry diagnostic criteria major psychiatric disorders still depended symptoms many cases aberrant social behavior big problem often accurate reflection patients disabled unable work limited social networks even though scales rate positive negative symptoms schizophrenia aberrant social behavior cut across number major psychiatric disorders first job community psychiatrist rated social behavior people community support program better predictor disability diagnosis ratings positive symptoms neuroscience social behavior remained resistant analysis beyond work done cortical lesions obvious comparisons syndromes people schizophrenia obvious frontal lesions dr kandel points developments areas ranging de novo point mutations affecting circuitry frontal cortex mirror neurons neuroendocrinology genetics social behavior review thomas insel work voles extension work bargmann elegans highlights importance specific systems social behavior systems preserved across species one interesting areas outlined dr kandel issue art neuroscience creation perception i posted abstract art able locate quote kandinsky abstract painter derives stimulus part nature nature whole multiplicity manifestations accumulate within led work art synthetic basis seeks appropriate form expression called nonobjective abstract form broader freer richer content objective form kandinsky complete writings art p kandel develops narrative based viennese art historians importance aesthetic response art response emotional one based life experience viewer neuroscience response studied looks inverse optics problem facial recognition comes flow diagram processes involved viewing visual art i realize i read article new book subject ordered copy review future date conclusory remarks neuroscience means society important easy cynical scientific endeavor also easy political neuroscience endure although much lesser degree psychiatry endures people commenting neuroscience seem know much many cases scientists even case scientists often easy forget public probably hear objective scientific typically hear experts unambiguously support one side scientific argument opposed kandel cautious suggested applications neuroscience society view panacea explanation behavior necessarily example attributing love simply extra blood flow particular part brain trivializes love brain could understand various aspects love fully seeing manifested brain develop time scientific insights would enrich understanding brain love hopefully time read paper i highlighted based reading neuroscience past years i end paragraph technical expertise i interviewing residency positions years ago one questions drew strongest emotional reaction program reading list residents question average elicited shock least irritation average residency director exception johns hopkins handed me neatly bound list several hundred references considered key references every psychiatric trainee read i taken sign applied trajectory life random circuitous studied i current residency director i would list neuroscience section following articles volume neuron would people often recoil i talk technical expertise needed psychiatrist technical seems like harsh word psychiatrists media debate essentially rhetorically based political discussions i would say read articles consider starting point might need know neuroscience psychiatry st century george
