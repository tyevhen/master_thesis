first possible bad news paleo primal diet fans see prospective cohort study people new york city elderly followed years every years given neurological neuropsychological tests addition food frequency questionnaire done beginning study look dietary patterns dp i copy paste results results two hundred fifty three subjects developed alzheimer dementia follow years identified dp strongly associated lower ad risk compared subjects lowest tertile adherence pattern ad hazard ratio confidence interval subjects highest dp tertile multivariable adjustment p trend dp characterized higher intakes salad dressing nuts fish tomatoes poultry cruciferous vegetables fruits dark green leafy vegetables lower intake high fat dairy products red meat organ meat butter oof say ai one note protective diet similar mediterranean style diet saturated fat organ meat friendly evolutionary based diet previous post i discussed cohort studies link diets high omega fatty acids reduced risk alzheimer review article i relied post looked several studies seemed show increased risk consumption saturated fat apoe proteins apolipoproteins key lipoproteins carry fats around brain rather like apolipoproteins apob ldl help carry fats around blood apoe famously linked increased risk developing alzheimer dementia worth peering closely i think fair good snigger usda sloppy science alzheimer researchers also hopelessly biased lipid hypothesis stephan peter done million times picked apart study study showing saturated fat could innocent bystander high sugar low omega consumption true one advantage alzheimer big news big money gone means zillion studies number thoughtful review articles details spelled i world expert fat metabolism means spelled useful i need answers perhaps found dietary fats cerebrovascular integrity alzheimer disease risk let roll sleeves dive first interesting quote mechanisms dietary fats sfa increase ad risk may seem less scientific priority delineate compared dietary compounds confer protection yet chronic disorders approach proven pivotal developing effective therapeutic strategies prevention treatment disease example elucidating role cholesterol atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease led evolution relatively safe effective cholesterol lowering drugs looks like lipid hypothesis fans work talk detail actual biochemistry actual biochemistry even interesting let go previous posts talked bit pathophysiology alzheimer dementia first get long build amyloid plaque tau protein tangles inflammation brain cell death turns blood vessels dementia patients none happy either changes blood vessels including smooth muscle cell endothelial cell proliferation seem precede last stages plaque build addition blood brain barrier bbb functions protect brain much gut supposed protect body outside insults seems poorly functioning patient alzheimer animal models saturated fat cholesterol rich diets seem make amyloidosis worse amyloid prone strains mice something interesting fat metabolism amyloid eat fat disassembled reassembled escorted chylomicrons blood liver processing turns amyloid beta loves hang chylomicrons chylomicrons amyloid beta blood something interesting compared low fat diet fed control rats saturated fat increased amount amyloid beta blood whereas fasting rats seemed amyloid beta blood low carb diet fans including me like compare low carb dieting fasting difference eating fat fasting fat floating gut liver via chylomicrons theory suggests ingestion saturated fat causes post prandial hyperamyloidemia couple theory finding folks alzheimer mild cognitive impairment greater amyloid beta blood plasma measurements include chylomicrons saturated fat eater might cause worried however much good evidence significant amount gut derived amyloid beta gets blood bbb brain even studies mice designed measure effect worst thing reasearchers found blood vessels brain seem well lot amyloid beta hanging around seems cause constriction blood vessels rigidity rather like accelerated aging accelerated aging hmmm i usually associated fat accelerated aging processes i usually associate hyperglycemia high blood glucose something interesting rage receptor advanced glycosylation end products pro oxidant nasties especially prevalent diabetics one small way amyloid beta get blood brain real meat saturated fat causes alzheimer hypothesis well researchers blame lipotoxicity yes lipotoxicity damage long chain saturated fat particularly palmitic acid causes endoplasmic reticulum cells triggering cell death apoptosis polyunsaturated monounsaturated fatty acids supposed protective whole host organ damage blamed phenomenon process also implicated endothelial dysfunction atherosclerosis heart failure kidney failure steatohepatitis fatty liver liver failure autoimmune inflammatory disorders susceptibility infections cancer ageing researchers say brain particularly vulnerable cortical astroglia metabolize heck lot fat oh remember end organ damage occurs context fat induced insulin resistance stepping back big picture please remember fat induced insulin resistance physiologic pathologic one ways body adapts low carb diet pathologic insulin resistance occurs context metabolic syndrome diabetes conditions exacerbated consumption high carbohydrate inflammatory western diets pathologic insulin resistance lipotoxicity i seriously doubt paper continues past lipotoxicity theory discussion membranes lipid rafts review studies mice rabbits fed western diet rich saturated fats cholesterol versus similar diet enriched dha omega fatty acid derived fish oil suggest dha helps membrane fluidity enabling better transport degradation amyloid beta whereas straight cholesterol saturated fat rich rats extra gut derived amyloid woeful lack lipid rafts help excess amyloid disposed go known health effects deficiency omega blamed saturated fat part western diet next theory saturated fat causes alzheimer paper relates membrane toxicity oxidized lipids something agree oxidized lipids cholesterol bad cause inflammation even brain problem sources dietary oxidized cholesterol include skim milk especially powdered skim milk saturated fats actually far difficult oxidize polyunsaturated fats vegetable oils omega i bit biased far i impressed seems easy poke holes saturated fat causes alzheimer theories frankly damning evidence manhattan dietary study constitute proof see next post likely i take closer look apoe fat metabolism
