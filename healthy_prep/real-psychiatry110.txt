i went harvard neuropsychiatry course wrong reasons i started going hms courses boston back late i always seen myself medical psychiatrist knowledgeable neurology medical imaging electroencephalography i always liked seeing people complicated problems associated psychiatric diagnoses psychiatric symptoms associated primary medical neurological diagnoses led me behavioral neurology courses harvard presentations done experts time including marcel mesulaum antonio damasio hanna damasio elliot ross david bear work well represented text principles behavioral cognitive neurology time older neuropsychiatry texts learning field generally occur reference reference basis i working memory disorders geriatric psychiatry clinic learning neuropsychiatry syndrome syndrome basis i find course largest meeting field occurring annual basis past two years motivation coming basically see whether i missed anything i always need answer question clinician working many hours per week keep technical field acceptable degree first time ever career i spending lot money conference travelling well outside comfort zone see presenters i know well people registered course setting hotel built early th century extensively remodeled star hotel status conference took place main ballroom densely populated overflow balcony seats mezzanine area back audiovisual effects worked large projection screen speaker large leds tvs lining side ballroom overall format course present lot technical information day discuss discrete diseases syndromes day detailed agenda days found link day focus neuroanatomy functional brain networks neuroimaging neuropsychiatric neuropsychological approaches complex patient detailed approach complex patient ted talks first three presentations covered slides way i like additional benefit powerpoints available pdf form online even unreadable slides easily visible form pdf form also allows syllabus printed black white used primarily note taking legibility slides depend print size many syllabus unreadable i think conferences use approach i would like modified original slides could reused lectures creative commons licenses early lecturers used lot subordinate clauses long sentences i could imagine anyone unfamiliar jargon could get lost lecturers unapologetic one suggested studying slides references get speed pace course intense brief coffee lunch breaks order cover advertised cme several lecturers ended accelerating presentations realized running time focus conferences information transfer style points lectures level i consider success key points highlighted well references couple graphics referenced syllabus course pages long could easily worked text point past i reviewed lectures conferences conference i going mention couple high points confusion neuropsychiatry barry fogel md defined end day neuropsychiatry branch clinical neuroscience mental health discipline always context brain every lecturer maintained theme reviewing key brain circuits involved pathological states including considered functional well states associated clear brain pathology cases formulations associated new conceptualization disorder good example case traumatic brain injuries tbi tom mcallister md made point long ago nobody would showed lecture tbi days common consider tbis especially occurring sports minor events reconceptualized perspective neuropathological changes protein markers tau app others possible progression dementia treatment neuropsychiatric syndromes tbi including depression ptsd psychiatric syndromes i used seeing lot people bipolar like syndromes tbis mentioned excellent reconstructions brain map results large number tbis presented emphasis circuitry affected lead symptoms i think earth shaking information single slide yes happen best example i think slide presentation neuropsychiatric aspects frontotemporal dementia brad dickerson md anyone followed diagnostic approaches relatively common dementia confusing years slide ftld frontotemporal lobar degeneration clinicopathological spectrum parses major clinical syndromes subtypes based biological markers category also color coded indicate degree tauopathy i found modified version slide article irwin et al frontiers aging neuroscience authors published significant number papers field review stood me clearest conceptualization ftld i seen second high point conference functional neurological symptom disorder fnsd actually subheading conversion disorder dsm p main diagnosis disorder known psychiatrists disorder one pseudoneurological symptoms like weakness paralysis sensory symptoms speech problems seizures known correlates medical diagnosis presentation gaston baslet md approach disorders informative rather take strict dsm criteria approach presented criteria illustrated levels diagnostic certainty levels diagnostic information ideal versus clinically available example given psychogenic non epileptic seizures pnes increased prevalence disorders neurological practice opposed primary care noted importantly approach treating disorder discussed well seems work model predisposing precipitating perpetuating factors presented like disorders cognitive behavioral therapy cbt useful treatment modality either psychotherapy delivered standard approach using self help manual dr baslet also discussed communication protocol present diagnosis rationale treatment patient limiting factors include low number patients complete treatment spontaneous improvement rate neurobiological model pnes fnsd presented based work van der kruijs et al important work psychiatrist experience treating pnes fnsd ongoing basis psychotherapy experience consistent presentation takes good communication patient effective model therapy get results forced normalization epilepsy term i unfamiliar even though i treated significant number people seizure disorders discussed gaston baslet second presentation neuropsychiatry epilepsy description syndrome psychotic states occur eeg abnormalities seizure disorder improve disappear neuropsychiatric symptoms emergence occurs also referred alternate psychosis small significant literature problem also highlights controversies presentation also discussed safety antidepressants epilepsy fda warning suicidality antiepileptic drugs aeds since i prescribed lot gabapentin treatment addiction anxiety chronic pain warning i address lot patients showed forest plot odds ratios specific aeds according reference drugs may protective suicidal ideation behavior discussion emerging interictal psychotic symptoms equivalent brief discussion antipsychotic drugs states would also useful dr baslet also mentioned one favorite neuropsychiatric symptoms alice wonderland syndrome metamorphopsia sometimes known like alice patient experience body distortion feeling tall floating sinking ground manifestation infectious disease originally epstein barr virus migraines epilepsy final brief point noted presentation neuropsychology aaron nelson phd useful time i think lot controversy assessments show commonest reason i see patients getting neuropsychological assessment days attention deficit hyperactivity disorder generally presented me proof disorder proof person needs stimulant medications patient generally reports tested adhd found despite normal development history normal typically good academic performance good vocational achievement i previously posted russell barkley phd one leading authorities adhd stated neuropsychological testing neither necessary sufficient make diagnosis adhd based clinical criteria course main reason neuropsychological testing individuals suspected adhd test associated learning disorders adult patients i see people recall information sort dr nelson points intraindividual variation neuropsychological test performance common participants study producing maximal discrepancies exceeded standard deviations test performance conclusion score variability alone enough base diagnostic inferences dr nelson also called show hands see clinicians access neuropsychological testing time frame less months hands raised favorite highlights conference many i trying keep post contained highlights overall focus intense conference good one follow assessment asked course three days rather two i endorsed approach i think inflammatory section neuropsychiatric disorders could reinforced psychiatrists write sections lahita text systemic lupus erythematosus present topic priorities conferences similar mine information transfer non experiential direct comparison skills experts priority might want attend conference next year course organizers question answer sessions regularly throughout program questions actively solicited course staff read answered lecturers turns approach self study paid several points i could stood given lecture may seem immodest believe practicing psychiatrists need constantly tested reassessed higher authority prove competent i never turns practice medicine think lot try keep literature one point lecturers asked many people audience psychiatrists many treated people frontotemporal dementia people psychiatrists assessed treated frontotemporal dementia despite fact diagnostic classification state flux past years thinking tremendous amount knowledge neuropsychiatric disorders room i ca imagine disorder general importance cerebral atrophy imaging well recognized primary care settings one reasons neuropsychiatrists needed concepts need taught understood residency
