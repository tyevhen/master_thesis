going something go ahead right honestly i write blog part i wanted know interface diet lifestyle inflammation pathology mental illness i could find trustworthy source requires lot work combing literature least interesting i learn lot however i say much literature pretty sad bunch quick easy research projects requiring people general fill forms occasionally medical records chased sometimes physical markers followed someone brings statistical wizard generate results authors try tie together references occasionally randomized trial whole experiment holes one could drive truck speak one hardly knows information means i take i get easy me critical i researcher i generate grants keep office real estate academic medical center always nice see paper went extra step closed loop actual testing extra math black keys gold ceiling right click open new tab paper day impressive variety reasons gastrointestinal inflammation associated immune activation schizophrenia via twitter feed zen dude chris kresser let step back think history schizophrenia bit nowadays era specialized medicine psychiatrists think brain comes organic issues childhood lifestyle personality comes coping problems pendulum swung back forth two coping vs brain pathology crazy psychiatry war less better understanding functional metabolism brain finally bridging gap let me tell post academic medicine setting one except radicals tying gut schizophrenia radar really think thorazine dopamine blockers began marching doorways big pharma nice pretty brain centered theory wherein neurons began going haywire producing psychosis since drugs like cocaine meth increase dopamine produce psychosis dopamine blockers reduce psychosis everyone happy bunch neurotransmitters like glutamate serotonin acetylcholine histamine appear tied still variation theory know could get right combination drugs block right neurotransmitters maybe could beat thing conception special protected space beyond blood brain barrier led lack holistic thinking well forgot schizophrenia always whole body disease particularly involving gut celiac special link schizophrenia adults schizophrenia autopsy often extensive inflammatory changes gi tract associations gone back literature prior development antipsychotics present day nearly impossible separate effects illness possible effects antipsychotic medication antipsychotics known slowing motility probably affect gut immune system reducing inflammatory response perhaps even reducing gut leakiness curtis dohan thought last bit might actually primary therapeutic action antipsychotics rather fancy dopamine blocking stuff brain know doctors likely use old fashioned antipsychotics antidepressants pretty impressive gi effects psychiatrists neurologists gastroenterologists reglan phernergan dopamine blockers chemically different antipsychotics like haldol thorazine think radical idea dopamine blockers ameliorate psychotic symptoms reducing inflammation gut okay cute theory except dohan dickerson whole lot good folks work many decades gastrointestinal inflammation associated immune activation schizophrenia paper schizophrenia research rather like bolt lightning done sherppard pratt johns hopkins heaven sake design take group folks developed schizophrenia within past months take group folks schizophrenia many years average yrs compare normal controls recruited community normal controls community determined relatively free psychiatric disease via structured clinical interview scid gold standard little gold standard touches take extra work make me happy take hour administer scid i remember maes paper recruited controls employees lab often folks work psych interest due personal issues close family members psychiatric problems research field employees might make biased controls i always comment issues papers simply time researchers checked subjects serum antibodies gluten casein gondii saccharomyces cerevisiae bugs associated schizophrenia gut issues crunched numbers observational study nice data collection twist i get later antibodies cerevisiae system called asca used marker intestinal inflammation used help diagnose crohn disease example gender related twists turns part found folks new onset longstanding schizophrenia significantly elevated asca levels compared controls high levels asca correlated part anti casein anti gluten antibodies would make sense gut inflammation casein gluten proteins could seep system immune system starts attack since gluten casein could neuroactive maybe neurotoxic could another part pathology schizophrenia autism etc asca levels significantly correlate anti gluten anti casein antibodies control group interesting right cares folks schizophrenia recruited johns hopkins pretty much medicated medication could part immune inflammatory effects researchers thought tangle designed second experiment second cohort comparing unmedicated recent onset schizophrenia patients germany medicated recent onset schizophrenics area recent onset unmedicated schizophrenics asca measures recent onset medicated schizophrenics german cohort tying together associations infections schizophrenia new onset patients significantly higher positive antibodies gondii non recent onset folks controls found folks schizophrenia higher level gut inflammation antibodies glutein casein conrols could vulnerabilities somehow begin brain issue start gut immune activation systemic poisons neuroactive food fragments infections hastening inflammatory decline brain genetically vulnerable antipsychotics work anti inflammatory gut decreasing dopamine activation brain neither pretty interesting questions
