follow previous post i saw blade runner i wanted post modern take turing test based coherent theory consciousness tononi koch experts neuroscience consciousness theory integrated information theory iit consciousness i included reference graphic public access paper theory also several useful videos available listen verbal descriptions theory i following consciousness research least past years including two main listservs topic shut topic specialized barring breakthroughs arguments become repetitive lot time spent bringing novices speed videos fill useful gap listservs previously addressed although i must admit i always biased toward written rather spoken word much efficient information transfer me videos listed bottom page also serve another useful purpose viewer able see researchers area define consciousness describe theories i think possible notice definitions descriptions vague limited utility one reasons i like approach koch tonini i also also say outset i sure whether view theory joint venture example i mean looking specific search consciousness finds tononi working area least years similar search koch goes back even years earlier i know either authors based reading paper seems like joint effort seems come across available videos presentations see addendum paper authors outline phenomenological definitions exacting i seen past authors also neuroscience based makes difference me various venues people often faintly praise lament psychiatry emphasis biology obviously true least without reason also illustrates lack research people comes critiquing psychiatry psychiatrists actively researched practically forms social psychological biological etiologies mental illness since specialty founded cursory review general psychiatric text illustrates point psychiatrist focused brain biology certainly without reason i previously posted breakfast i mentor long career psychiatrist summed way lot psychiatrists biology critics take mean kind medical intervention certainly studied every non medical intervention studied well common read non medical interventions psychotherapy meditation etc altering brain way psychiatry known within field least years two levels study work tononi koch first purely descriptive level level find first reference second level level neuroscience mathematical theory authors produced work well reference paper purpose post i going stay descriptive level possibly post technical article advanced theory later date i add several competing theories consciousness i going mention i studied several think less offer integrated information theory iit consciousness i admittedly reductionist seeking close explanatory gap brain biology conscious states generated videos available online panel discussions clear proponents theories think theories correct iit wrong i rabbit hole theories want take time criticize feel free look form opinion i focus iit never heard tononi koch iit first task read paper i found clear terms definitions postulates clearly stated theory point every experience associate neural correlate consciousness ncc currently explanatory gap level conscious experiences actually produced ncc discuss axioms necessary coherent phenomenology consciousness move postulates eventually discuss conceptual structure maximally irreducible conceptual structure occurs brain states also known quale give couple examples conscious states occur within theory provide example calculate quality consciousness given particular state containing elements figure provide clear example physical substrate experience complex set maximally irreducible cause effect repertoires concept maximally irreducible cause effect structure cause effect space made concepts conceptual structure qualep quantity experience consciousness specified max quality experience form shape conceptual structure distinct shapes occur different experiences accessible example discussed page seeing jennifer aniston movie

sophisticated machine machine recognizing inputs human nervous system would recognize producing identical outputs even machine duplicates structure function human brain conscious tononi uses
