let continue journey deconstructing reverse engineering psychiatry evolutionary medicine perspective i assume correct answer see many pieces fit danger approach main hypothesis incorrect i might wasting lot time i bit fun process quite remarkable many connections made using intuitive evolutionary framework lay data date large number studies covering topic dementia omega fatty acids couple reasons omega thoroughly studied stamina i take bit molecular biology first inflammation alzheimer linked omega basically anti inflammatory dha modified phospholipases become neuroprotectin neurons superhero neuroprotectin alzheimer patients lower phospholipase activity brain tissue csf platelets sorts inflammatory stressors lack oxygen exposure amyloid il cause regulation phospholipase leading formation neuroprotectin dha reverses inflammatory cascade perfect negative feedback inhibition works best doubt omega balanced evolutionary style diet secondly imbalance aa derived omega vs dha omega may critical formation amyloid plaques first place amyloid precursor protein cut particular ways make toxic fragments eventually aggregate amyloid plaques seems brain cell membranes rich dha squiggles wiggles dha hide protect bad cleavage sites amyloid precursor protein aa squiggles wiggles seem expose bad cleavage sites making easier make plaque amyloid precursor protein dha also seems make physically harder cut amyloid precursor protein bad way dha also chemically cripples action amyloid creating enzyme gamma secretase addition reducing inflammatory action plaque dha formed neuroprotectin studies omega dementia reasonably good cross sectional epidemiological prospective cohort studies done years better quality others course used food frequency questionnaires lab measurements fatty acid ratios serum plasma overall studies followed people japan canada europe dementia regular population cohorts results time studies found correlations part diets high fish associated less dementia diets high omega saturated fat total fat cholesterol associated dementia association especially strong people without genetic predisposition alzheimer people without apoe allele apoe short apolipoprotein way yes like high density lipoprotein hdl low density lipoprotein ldl apolipoproteins carry around fat cholesterol brains later post overall trend enough cause researchers try prospective controlled trials omega supplementation dementia done date first one badly designed beginning alzheimer patients treated mg omega epa since epa important fatty acid brain far know effect cognitive decline supplement arm placebo arm studies japan mg aa dha compared mg olive oil daily days mild cognitive impairment group pufas showed improvement whereas olive oil group improvement also large subjects double blind randomized controlled trial done grams dha grams epa placebo months followed additional months open label everyone got omega treatment overall difference two groups except one subgroup mild cognitive impairment better omegas another small study similar results cognitively normal elderly folks randomized mg dha day placebo months treatment arm doubled plasma dha levels showed improvement learning memory tests main study objective global battery score controls improve second trial subjects mild moderate alzheimer dementia grams dha vs placebo meet primary objective despite healthy increases serum csf levels dha treatment arm whew science plausible molecular mechanism followed epidemiological studies followed randomized controlled trials overall science tells omega probably protective amyloid helpful memory non demented mildly demented individuals benefited severe cases last alzheimer post i discussed amyloid builds decades amyloid zapping interventions end stage like dousing fire house burned theoretically omega benefit inflammatory stage i wonder outcome severe cases would omega held evolutionary ratio general talking mega doses epidemiological studies dha intakes mg day correlated reduction dementia average western diet intake mg day fatty fish three times week would trick two schools thought getting ratios correct paleosphere one way let time side avoid excess omega supplement prudently omega dha easily oxidized would want supplement oil taste fish example teaspoons another way take high amounts omega less wash omega method might make sense desperate situation mild cognitive impairment already active heart disease bad autoimmune stuff going risk high amounts pufas tough liver bad combine sugar alcohol likely cancer promoting perspective get away take slow compared number medical treatments various diseases civilization even higher doses pufas short term likely safer possibly beneficial post ipad i adding references later i get moment bigger computer done
