i reading book sean carroll evolution evo devo points survey many countries came last understanding evolution worse last agreement evolutionary principles come earlier species answer led me thinking also applies field psychotherapy even though clearly evolutionary result gone understand humans without understanding ahistorical beings indeed may well come along full force zeus evolution explain even though key scientists world consider darwin discovery important history science bias toward present leaves confined away history may predominance anti evolutionary beliefs country evolution passed way proper psychotherapy origins left behind acknowledge know result early early months years shaped changed evolution i say early lives shape personalities help determine become therapy heavily evolutionary allows see personal history light brain evolution something ignored yet ignored majority therapists never even mention evolution books papers cult present findings results within

probable causes use history search answers true research psychotherapy bother me facts get i want go aspect decades primal therapy observing patients drop deep brain imprints i noticed something critical points difference statistical conclusions observation clinical ones longer term patients arrive brainstem memories sometimes start onset migraine headache quite severe comes suddenly patient idea happening often harbinger something totally unexpected although migraine attacks previously took new painkillers transiently effective get deeper pain often hurtful begin breathing problems catch breath went headache pain exacerbates drop heart actual memory depletion oxygen mother given powerful anesthesia blocked pain also shut oxygen supplies baby newborn patient knows enough oxygen figure goes along therapy quite common leads believe primary primal cause affliction template years follow slight stress trouble catching one breath depletion oxygen leading severe migraine headaches focus early life imprints way know behind symptoms one needs pain killers life begins million dollar research causes looking biochemistry neurology etc yes sometimes find correlates concomitants help explain processes blood flow brain dysfunction rarely causes must always beware difference two correlated causes changes everything often helpful therapy correlated oxygen therapy course many options prescribed painkilling drugs somewhat effective time surprise whatever helps constrict blood vessels like coffee helps conserve oxygen lessens pain let make sure treating correlate helps ease pain
