following press release national institute health received morning many know knockout mouse model used much kennedy disease research performed today release explains phase ii approach developing additional knockout mouse models support research first three paragraphs summarize announcement department health human services national institutes health nih news national human genome research institute nhgri nhgri nih gov immediate release thursday september next five years national institutes health nih funded researchers extensively test generate data mice disrupted genes gain clues human diseases nih today awarded set cooperative agreements totaling million begin second phase knockout mouse project komp results next stage called knockout mouse phenotyping project komp placed public database researchers make knockout mice disrupting function individual genes across animal genome komp trans nih nih common fund project work members international knockout mouse phenotyping consortium impc generate strains knockout mice undergo large battery clinical phenotype tests phenotype includes biological information appearance behavior measurable physical biochemical characteristics information help reveal traits affected deleting given gene individual mouse long term project aims enable research community establish traits associated function every protein coding gene mammalian genome information valuable discovery genetic causes human diseases aid efforts identify new drug targets generation detailed phenotypic information knockout mouse strain boon disease researchers want determine function genes improve mouse models human disease said nih director francis collins ph i grateful people programs across nih supporting effort international partners joined scientific endeavor partnership several international programs initial five year phase komp reach goal creating knockout mouse embryonic stem cell lines approximately protein coding genes mouse genome year international knockout mouse consortium ikmc includes knockout mouse project komp european conditional mouse mutagenesis program eucomm funded european commission texas institute genomic medicine tigm north american conditional mouse mutagenesis project norcomm funded genome canada nih committed making knockout mouse models widely accessible biomedical research community said james battey ph director national institute deafness communication disorders nidcd also co chairman trans nih mouse initiative getting valuable models hands wide range researchers serve accelerate efforts develop new strategies understanding treating human disease next five years komp transform knockout mouse embryonic stem es cells adult mice lines well characterized knockout mice strains impc create additional knockout mouse strains mouse undergo standard analysis results compared mice tested nih awarded six cooperative agreements three groups establish production phenotype centers project going take great deal scientific teamwork assimilate phenotypic information knockout mouse resource confident team assembled accomplish task said national human genome research institute nhgri director eric green ph nhgri involved planning administration komp national center research resources ncrr administer awards production centers nhgri administer awards phenotyping centers ncrr nhgri components nih funded

oakland research institute california charles river laboratories wilmington mass jackson laboratory bar harbor maine resource enable many researchers tap power knockout mice exploring gene function turn speed efforts improve human health said louise ramm ph acting director national center research resources addition production phenotype centers nih awarded five year cooperative agreement totaling million european bioinformatics institute hinxton england collaborate mrc harwell wellcome trust sanger institute set data coordination center database track progress project coordinate efforts komp impc researchers addition center build integrated web portal provide researchers access phenotype data mouse key mammalian system produce genomics resource long history depth understanding mouse genetics availability mouse genome sequence researchers made advances last several years improving efficiency decreasing cost generating knockout mice historically researchers generated lines knockout mice serve models human disease heart disease cancer however rather generating detailed comprehensive phenotype mouse often interested handful phenotypes example researcher interested cardiovascular disease may want examine effect disrupted gene blood pressure single lab approach expensive inefficient researcher access low cost knockout mouse extensively phenotyped focus time research budget depth research questions rather spending producing knockout mouse researcher limited information komp impc researchers begin creating lines knockout mice embryonic stem cells produced komp genes knocked selected nominations already submitted research community many selected genes used study disease processes underlying mechanisms others selected based genetic variations associated human diseases uncovered genome wide association studies statistically percent mouse pups inherit copies knocked gene littermates one copy heterozygous normal knockout mice healthy littermates undergo battery phenotype measurements multiple times lives tests include ray imaging magnetic resonance imaging mri blood exams balance tests urine fecal analysis name knockout normal phenotype data made available komp data coordination center researchers acquire study knockout mice compare various phenotypes want characterize line mice broadly assumptions gene said impc executive director mark moore ph think function gene needle haystack removing haystack see needle end initial five years effort nih impc evaluate usefulness resource research community evaluation positive one efforts may scale create phenotype total knockout mice knockout mouse phenotyped researchers obtain information knockout mouse lines available order university california davis komp repository access
