specific locations miraculously travelling halfway around world yeah supernatural beings spend inordinate amounts time racking family utility bill causing kind real harm fuck fine i ca tolerate horror movies amount little long chain plot holes jump scares screaming i looking oculus i high hopes unlike last say found footage horror movies i seen one nebulously evil supernatural presence terrorizing family one team naive anthropologists sketchy french treasure hunters discovering horrifying secret catacombs beneath paris everything needed great unique setting fuckload human remains legitimate reason entire movie filmed dark way could fuck watch trailer tell me already preparing shit pants completely fucked sure movie fair share blood screams scares spend much time trying figure could possibly make sense anyone recently sustained traumatic brain injury movie completely ceases scary consider zero reason break catacombs illegally sometime near beginning movie introduced main character scarlett marlowe genius i solve rubik cubes sense term scarlett genius geniuses masturbate grant applications get rejected despite played year old actress already professor one prestigious schools united kingdom holds two phds master degree three largely unrelated fields urban archeology chemistry symbology field whose prominence da vinci code apparently made people forget fictional

scarlett random schmuk world renowned expert least two fields fictional years experience excavating sites every bit delicate catacombs getting access catacombs involve hiring sketchy local nightclub sneaking away guided tour matter filling correct paperwork people time life ever devoid excitement find following archeology news notice new discoveries made catacombs every couple months scarlett think non insane way explaining grant committee looking philosopher stone wave diplomas around little go collect cheque scarlett posing front archeological dig cost lots lots money oh i mention cheque actually kind important see scarlett attempting conduct major archeological expedition money actually things work much chagrin every university earth academics survive tap water tears graduate students alone need funding make research happen scarlett going expedition involve busting ancient stone walls hundreds feet ground even bring fucking shovel equipment trained assistants open access area one think get worried disappears tunnel beneath earth crust never comes also forced assume plane tickets hotel costs missed pay associated expedition costs happy pay pocket even clearly superior alternative available movie never really gives reason scarlett opts illegally breaking catacombs live world totally get grant money investigate ufo sightings expected believe renowned academic like scarlett absolutely way get money permission poke around catacombs even evidence hidden chamber actually exists way trust life good looking french stranger top financial issues actually least problems see hundreds years white english speaking academics proudly marching countries taking shit archeology started get bad reputation among populations studied since kind hard deny bad guy exhuming remains

england barging catacombs illegally exercising poor judgement shitting code conduct entire profession catacombs incredibly important part france history willing risk causing massive damage later purposes without even courtesy letting know care ancestors laid rest decision illegally break inexplicable since never given solid reason academic powerhouse like scarlett would denied access place routinely studied archaeologists i forced assume gets breaking historical sites planned whole expedition give nation france big dirt covered middle finger would explain movie poster need evidence hidden catacombs paris ridiculously easy get access ask nicely consider actually filmed paris catacombs specifically parts open public film documentary shitty low budget horror film filled list actors still got permission stomp around cameras strapped heads long tested make sure air breathable little detail scarlett forgets worry said i could almost forgive cavalier attitude toward excavation permits decent careful scientist turns scarlett destroys history uncovers scarlett marlowe would happen indiana jones daughter nicolas cage sent first dig jackhammer blindfold minutes manages cause damage study human history human dinosaur coexistence museum i mentioned previous point attempting uncover long lost underground chamber least one recorded collapse history things thinks bring

centuries drying dusty tunnel things shatter easily willpower second day diet i spent time working lab handled human remains things already delicate foam padding workbenches dropping bones onto hard counter even inches enough force potentially damage even little bit damage bones could catastrophic scarlett already made find lifetime could saved one painful death burning car stopped remember catacombs provide lot information know ancient paris everyone buried soldiers prisoners war ordinary citizens examining tiny details skeletal remains figure people died lived pitting bones tell

dream turns learning information people tunnels pipe dream scarlett chooses march crew right grinding remains bone meal destroying valuable clues might told responsible scientists people used bones wants publish papers lost gravesites alchemy chase history stomping fun stop scarlett finally gets side tunnel promptly collapses behind effectively ruining chance world might study remains wanders around smashing things finally uncovers looking deep ground chamber containing perfectly preserved body hundred something year old templar knight piles priceless treasure believe long lost philosopher
