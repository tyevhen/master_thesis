researchers chasing elusive links gluten major mental illness decades despite hyperbolic coverage wheat belly slightly convincing coverage grain brain far quite bit smoke fire outside case studies curt dohan quite papers back day including one much recently faith dickerson armed antibody titres could precise including paper last couple years rather stunning data catie trial large multi center study schizophrenia treatment run nimh last decade schizophrenics likely anti ttg antibodies healthy controls likelihood high aga antibodies gliadin compared normal controls made researchers take notice yet face could really say wow certain subset people schizophrenia sure suspicious antibodies different wheat proteins pretty clear devastating neurological illness caused gluten dystonias people example without classic celiac gut findings issue schizophrenia leaky gut thus higher antibody titres certain food moieties wheat i covered questions bit detail one major issue theory wheat causes schizophrenia schizophrenia seems similar prevalence gluten non gluten eating areas since schizophrenia pretty clearly recognized final common pathway number different genetic environmental pathologies would necessarily torpedo gluten theory finally test whether gluten free diets help symptoms subset schizophrenics suspicious wheat antibodies newest round researchers led jessica jackson along alessio fasano university maryland emily severance johns hopkins following leads come little closer cage elephant first gluten free diet people schizophrenia anti tissue transglutaminase anti gliadin antibodies paper starts discussing mixed results previous trials gluten free diets schizophrenia showing subset real improvement remission astonishing finding many without improvement whatsoever none studies tried differentiate schizophrenics without anti ttg aga mostly done titres available paper makes distinction anti ttg antibodies likely signify celiac disease whereas aga likely signify non celiac gluten sensitivity current paper exactly two patients schizophrenia one woman symptomatic since man symptomatic past years positive antibody titres one anti ttg one aga stable medicines still symptomatic pretty common put inpatient unit observed gluten free diet two weeks woman improved concentration attention critical psychotic symptoms often respond relatively well medication poor executive functioning attention concentration responsive deficits keep many people schizophrenia able function independently man reduction psychotic symptoms increased insight condition since schizophrenia progressive neurodegenerative disease seeing improvement particularly woman sick since non medicine intervention two weeks time least interesting limitations study profound open label tiny get obviously taking someone sticking inpatient unit structure observation intervention level improvement enough schizophrenia research topmost tier psychiatry journals certainly medical hypothesis published paper available free full text pubmed care click link second paper sent me amazing victoria prince finished last rotations medical school woo hoo i love paper i want give emily severance hug ideas brings together already deserves hug previous paper i discussed article schizophrenia gut know schizophrenia multitudes complex genetic environmental immune mediated ergo anti gluten immune response following toxoplasma gondii infection mice i know mice also available free full text plosone anyway already know folks schizophrenia higher levels gut inflammation measured checking antibodies known infections get system gut inflammation infections actively cause gut inflammation old friend toxoplasma gondii newer onset illness likely find gut inflammation antibodies gluten casein likely signs gut inflammation dr severance sought answer questions raised finding infection cause gut pathology allowed neurotoxic food fragments attack brain genetically susceptible infections problem brain food antibodies secondary infections well difficult say unethical sorts experiments need answer questions humans mice housed infected little immune systems examined greater numbers several generations readily researchers took mice gave delicious gondii infected rodent chow via infected ground mouse brains infected adult mice subset female mice knocked could check pups gut inflammation well lot mini experiments paper i wo explain death paper freely available anyway infection gondii serum antibodies wheat proteins complement activation sign well bred mice rather measure inflammation increased infected groups mock infected uninfected groups anti wheat antibodies mouse pups born infected moms also significantly higher born uninfected mouse moms proof mice infection toxoplasma known risk factor schizophrenia humans leads generation anti gluten antibodies presumably via gut inflammatory mechanism importantly mouse pups anti gluten antibodies infection happen time critical neurodevelopment thus combination infection perhaps dietary enhancer possibly gluten could working concert make someone vulnerable developing schizophrenia later gut inflammatory mechanism vague point celiac disease humans associated anti ttg antibodies definitely gut damage permeability non celiac gluten sensitivity associated aga seem frank leakage apparently large gluten peptides cross border via transcytosis may happen readily gut infected immune system case things frankly exact details gluten gut continue elude check last paragraph paper big hugs summary models described paper provide appropriate experimental tools examine impacts gluten peptides gondii associated immune activation brain physiology accumulate information analyses clinical biomarkers adapt animal models test effects dietary modifications types infections behavioral endpoints pharmacological outcomes specific antipsychotics immune system parameters autoimmune response responses triggered gondii infection ultimately envision translational system fully evaluate interface environmental perturbation genetic predisposition relates serious neurodevelopmental disorders schizophrenia bipolar disorder autism i never linear person i tend absorb think things part i like called evolutionary psychiatry think lots things impact physiology immune activation genetics researchers also seem think way also break questions leave gaping holes severance previous experiment took trouble go across ocean study gut immune activation medication naiive medicated schizophrenics taking major confounder schizophrenia research kinds thinkers need good science work big complex tangles i ca wait next papers come mean time clinical guidance worth checking schizophrenics anti ttg aga risks recommending gluten free diet likelihood strictly followed outpatient setting always questions answers
