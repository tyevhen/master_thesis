companies ca friends even public radio got crestor prescriptions rise doctors get free meals pretty clear court public media big pharma bribing doctors using drugs expensive drugs really article suggests even casual reader could hone discussion session article read following cross sectional data disclaimers causation versus correlation data cross sectional findings reflect association necessarily causality linked months open payments data year medicare part prescription data also could determine whether high prescription rates brand name drugs preceded followed temporally unrelated receipt industry sponsored meals policy implications findings thus depend clarification mechanism association receipt industry sponsored meals physician prescribing behavior two additional paragraphs study limitations follow clearly show initial look data significant limitations various blogs sites picked paper well many physician sites also seem favor narrow interpretation seen press cases nod
