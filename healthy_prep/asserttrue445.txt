pharma industry big problem hands placebos getting way effective something needs done placebo response old saying would seem hold true case one answer come low placebo response study designs patent possible yes possible getting ahead story placebo effect always problem drug companies especially problem low efficacy drugs psych meds particular example problem provided eli lilly march press release announcing failure phase ii trials involving new atypical antipsychotic known ly monohydrate mglu lilly said study hbbi neither ly monohydrate comparator molecule olanzapine zyprexa known effective placebo separated placebo particular study lilly observed greater expected placebo response approximately double historically seen schizophrenia clinical trials emphasis added fast forward august lilly throws towel mglu according report genetic engineering technology news independent futility analysis concluded hy mc hbbn second lilly two pivotal phase iii studies unlikely positive primary efficacy endpoint enrolled completion lilly alone rexahn pharmaceuticals november issued press release disappointing phase iib trials new antidepressant serdaxin saying results study demonstrate serdaxin efficacy compared placebo measured montgomery asberg depression rating scale madrs groups showed approximate point improvement protocol defined primary endpoint madrs march astrazeneca threw towel adjunctive antidepressant tc drug failed beat placebo phase iii trials news account put cost failure half billion dollars december shares biosante pharmaceutical inc slid single session company experimental gel promoting libido postmenopausal women failed perform well placebo late stage trials drug companies say failures happening drugs ineffective placebos recently become effective clinical trials evidence increasing placebo effectiveness see yesterday post i showed graph placebo efficacy antidepressant trials year period idea desperation felt drug companies glimpsed slideshow alternate link anastasia ivanova department biostatistics unc chapel hill discusses tactics mitigating high placebo response final solution something called sequential parallel comparison design spcd cascading multi phase protocol design canonical two phase version start larger usual group placebo subjects relative non placebo subjects phase one run trial usual end placebo non responders randomized second phase study like first phase uses placebo control arm study arm spcd differs usual placebo run design actually eliminate placebo responders overall study instead keeps results phase two placebo group data added effectively dilute higher phase one placebo results assumption course placebo non responders non responsive placebo phase two identified non responders phase one industry argot carry noneffect placebo phase one placebo phase two bit chicanery i know else call seems pointless math ivanova slideshow explains detail basically optimize ratio placebo study arm subjects properly end increasing overall power study keeping placebo response minimized translates big bucks pharma companies strive mightily keep cost drug trials enrolling many subjects might needed give study desired power words maximizing study power per enrollee key spcd spcd first introduced literature paper fava et al psychother psychosom may jun interesting title problem placebo response clinical trials psychiatric disorders culprits possible remedies novel study design approach title interesting paints placebo response evil complete cuplrits paper maurizio fava colleagues point possible causes increasing placebo response considered others diagnostic misclassification issues concerning inclusion exclusion criteria outcome measures lack sensitivity change measurement errors poor quality data entry verification waxing waning natural course illness regression toward mean phenomenon patient clinician expectations trial study design issues non specific therapeutic effects high attrition glossing obvious possibility paid research subjects hire volunteers desperate many cases obtain free medical care willing tell researchers whatever want hear whatever useless palliative given fava coauthors make baffling statement thus far attempt develop new study designs aimed reducing placebo effect go present spcd less revolutionary advance quest quelch placebo effect point science i think ever discussion scientific paper need attack placebo effect something bothersome something interferes scientific progress something needs guarded vigilantly like swine flu whole idea placebo effect getting way producing meaningful results repugnant i think anyone scientific training even repugnant however fava group stop mere paper psychotherapy psychosomatics went apply obtain patents spcd behalf general hospital corporation boston relevant patent numbers recent granted july look google patents patents begin statement method system performing clinical trial reduced placebo effect disclosed incredibly whole point invention mitigate actually defeat placebo effect i know anybody else sees disturbing me repulsive interested licensing patents rct logic happy talk download white paper slides visit website antidepressants drugs become miserably ineffective hopelessly useless clinical trials need redesign scientific protocols way defeat placebo effect view placebo effect something needs made go away protocol fudging puts new scientific era indeed apparently welcome new world wonder drugs pass tic tacs
