i reading article day move researchers making towards trying reprogram genes help clean waste materials nerve cells article mentions kennedy disease parkinson disease huntington disease als diseases motor neurons article well written i i could understand overview really go detail current research area link article hoarding junk hard nerves neurodegenerative diseases reading article however made me want write little mutated gene kennedy disease since mutation cag three pieces dna repeated expanded people kennedy disease caused androgen receptor function normally earlier research clinical trials focused blocking trying day job cleaning cell garbage since change gene researchers attempting change process normalize remove minimize toxicity trying make protein behave normally several posts i wrote researchers today trying find way make androgen receptors day jobs two recent articles igf part i part ii example new way thinking maria pennuto explained role day job igf might help continue job catch mutation early enough dr diane merry chat last fall talked team approach researchers duke university working ways allow day job still slow progression kennedy disease donald mcdonald duke designing whole libraries compounds bind prevent shape change found involved toxicity nice thing duke compounds called sarms selective modulators bind prevent toxicity initial studies still allow day job asc another potential treatment seems prevent aggregation promote shredding protein probably directly affecting shape change heather montie chat last december also discussed earlier current research differs combating mutation leuporelin drug used japan clinical trial inhibits testosterone formation keeps nucleus extent avodart kind thing since inhibits potent androgen dht made work gave clues need focus direct therapy towards events occur within nucleus mutant leads toxicity current project concerns modification normally occurs called acetylation addition chemical group protein allows various things within nucleus i found inhibit 'modification inhibits toxicity mutant poses little bit issue inhibiting 'modification decreases ability 'day job i also found 'toggle modification little bit still rescues cells motor neurons mutant toxic effects personally i like concept allowing day job seems normal trying prohibit inhibit functioning i anxious hear approach hope see clinical trial soon
