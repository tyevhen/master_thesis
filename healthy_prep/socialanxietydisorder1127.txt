perhaps largest brain study date worldwide researchers institutions found brain size memory centers larger individuals specific genetic markers study refer impact exercise brain trekdesk treadmill desks offers reminder walking steps day proven increases brain size mental capabilities decrease odds mental degradation disease neurologists worldwide intrigued study published journal nature genetics matched measured genetic similarities among healthy subjects study uncovered individuals rather specific genetic locations hmga gene possessed larger brains actually scored higher standardized iq tests commenting findings lead researcher paul thompson university california stated really exciting discovery single letter change leads bigger brain first time watertight evidence genes affect brain study also reported consistent relationship minor changes genetic code diminished memory centers found subjects smaller brain sizes smaller brain size shown biological marker brain disorders depression bipolar disorder alzheimers dementia schizophrenia researchers commented drugs could developed target gene variants perhaps reduce risk diseases trekdesk treadmill desks ceo steve bordley believes important part discussion missing milestone research already know consistent daily exercise increases brain size reduces risks many debilitating mental diseases arent sending wrong

question new study shows brain size tied genes trekdesk treadmill desks may offer means even score question lesbians born lesbians study done washington straight men showed men lesbian porn every single man fully aroused showed straight porn every single man fully aroused showed gay porn men little aroused explains offense lot gay men little bit girly flamboyant studies show gay womb environment another article showed gay men straight men different size brains thought differently another study new york heterosexual women showed videos pictures naked men naked women one far aroused naked woman every single one male female sexuality appears different men visual one although unlike women men cant seduced sex either born gay women although straight engage homosexual behavior seduction gay males straight males wired different i read loads lesbians i find article says born way soo many studies said gay men ever i ask lesbians lesbian always reply i find women attractive answer studies sound true saying much i would get aroused naked woman i also get aroused looking myself naked i engage sexual activity woman i find attractive way i want anything every true gay lesbian want sex sexually physically emotionally etc truly attracted choose born way like i born person attracted opposite sex born attracted sex theory hormone imbalance male estrogen woman testosterone question people marijuana uneducated like still believe kills brain cells despite never proven study claiming beyond flawed study suggesting might actually stimulate growth new brain cells causes cancer never link found marijuana smoking sort cancer however shown weed smokers less likely get brain cancer neck cancer prostate cancer etc shown shrink tumour size starve cancerous cells leaving healthy onces alone people get arrogant attitudes better someone smoke weed despite fact go binge drinking every weekend alcohol proven much harmful weed claim easy od marijuana never one reported case history happening think legalization cause minors use despite fact statistics show countries states legalized medical marijuana actually seen overall decrease teen usage think legalization would support drug dealers driven business since people would rather buy legally answer people ignorant brain washed government people still support war laws harmless plant i believe generation fix lot problem need vote opinions heard question octopus mans new best friend unseasonably warm day middle march i traveled new hampshire moist dim sanctuary new england aquarium hoping touch alternate reality i came meet athena aquariums forty pound five foot long two half year old giant pacific octopus me momentous occasion i always loved octopuses sci fi alien startlingly strange someone even grows one hundred pounds stretches eight feet long could still squeeze boneless body opening size orange animal whose eight arms covered thousands suckers taste well feel mollusk beak like parrot venom like snake tongue covered teeth creature shape shift change color squirt ink intriguing recent research indicates octopuses remarkably intelligent many times i stood mesmerized aquarium tank wondering i stared horizontal pupils octopuss large prominent eyes staring back meand thinking long ago question like would seemed foolish crazy octopus know anything much less form opinion octopuses invertebratesthey dont even belong insects like dragonflies dung beetles least seem show smarts octopuses classified within invertebrates mollusk family many mollusks like clams brain recently scientists accorded chimpanzees closely related humans share blood transfusions dignity mind increasingly researchers study octopuses convinced boneless alien animalscreatures whose ancestors diverged lineage would lead roughly million years agohave developed intelligence emotions individual personalities findings challenging understanding consciousness i always longed meet octopus chance senior aquarist scott dowd arranged introduction back room would open top athenas tank consented i could touch heavy lid covering tank separated two worlds one world mine reality air

live regardless whether live land water percent animals invertebrates like athena moment lid reached already oozed far corner lair hiding top tank investigate visitor eight arms boiled twisting slippery meet mine i plunged arms elbow deep fifty seven degree water athenas melon sized head bobbed surface left eye octopuses one dominant eye like humans dominant hand swiveled socket meet mine shes looking dowd said gazed others eyes athena encircled arms latching first dozens hundreds sensitive dexterous suckers arm two hundred famous naturalist explorer william beebe found touch octopus repulsive i always struggle i make hands duty seize tentacle confessed me athenas suckers felt like aliens kissat probe caress although octopus taste skin suckers taste touch exquisitely developed athena tasting me feeling me knowing skin possibly blood bone beneath way i could never fathom i stroked soft head fingertips changed color beneath touch ruby flecked skin going white smooth i learned sign relaxed octopus agitated giant pacific octopus turns red skin gets pimply erects two papillae eyes divers say look like horns one name species devil fish sharp parrotlike beaks octopuses bite neurotoxic flesh dissolving venom pressure octopuss suckers tear flesh one scientist calculated break hold suckers much smaller common octopus would require quarter ton force one volunteer interacted octopus left aquarium arms covered red hickeys smart answer lots animals smart tend define intelligence using yard stick words animals seem smart things appear similar way would things understand measure animals perceive world way smart could get killed environments school evolutionary thought argues brains evolve use tools organisms words birds learn fly wings humans capacity sense world every inch skin like octopi would perceive differently brains would learn take advantage fact possibly would smarter case would appear smarter octopus relative much simpler answer octopi nature little snacks native environment need lot different strategies evade many predators diet varied need different strategies hunt different animals smart sources many list
