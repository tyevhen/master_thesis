following part two guest post ed meyertholen receive kda xpress newsletter saw article fall edition since article little long blog i broke two parts part ii stem cells created equal begin stem cell therapy obviously one needs stem cells come researcher get turns several different sources stem cells embryonic stem es cells es cells type controversial es cells harvested early embryonic stage capable forming almost every possible cell type cells authentic stem cells practice cells acquired embryos formed vitro fertilization ivf process infertile couples attempt get pregnant using ivf value es cells truly differentiated cell type case kd example could differentiated motor neurons motor neurons could injected hopefully find right area spinal cord begin mature grow make correct neural connections muscle cells way would replace missing cells relieve symptoms kd neural progenitor cells npc subtype stem cells essentially partially differentiated stem cells become neural cells found mature fetuses certain parts adult brains also formed es possible cells could obtained post mortem brains even collected brains individuals undergoing neurosurgery believed cells induced differentiate almost neuronal cell subtype including motor neurons like es npc maintained differentiated petri dish injected patients mesenchymal stem cells msc stem cells isolated bone marrow cells primarily precursor cells creating different types bone cartilage cells evidence might possible educate form nerve cells induced pluripotent stem ips cells cells generated adult tissues often cell known fibroblast reprogramed become stem cells ideally would great way obtain stem cells however technical safety issues need worked becomes viable source stem cells great potential stem cell technology great potential especially regard treatment diseases kd alas many years realization potential still several major technical barriers must overcome viable therapy example one forms motor neurons either es npc derived patient cells thus good potential tissue rejection hand cells derived patient cells would case msc ipc cells injected would contain genetic defect cell died another issue injected cells know go kd loss motor neurons lower parts brain along spinal cord one would need inject cells areas possible simply inject cells blood would make brain complicated surgical procedure would used place cells correct areas even problem solved transplanted neuron must grow make physical connections muscle cells muscle cells cells lost connections assuming could done estimated growth new connections would likely take year complete course also problem rest brain communicates new transplanted cells conscience control motor neurons control mediated neural connections brain connections must recreated transplanted cells i trying say use stem cells matter origin unparalleled potential treat diseases kd actual use stem cells treat neurodegenerative diseases clinical practice years away important point let me add one point one search internet find many sites advertise stem cell therapy many different disorders legitimate sorry say many present time proven clinical procedures using stem cells successfully treat kd see web page claiming otherwise suspicious please talk physician risk money life treatments
