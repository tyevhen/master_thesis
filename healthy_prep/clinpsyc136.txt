i alluded yesterday whopper study appeared new england journal medicine tracked study antidepressant submitted fda comparing results seen fda comparison data published medical literature fda uses raw data submitting drug companies study makes great sense fda statisticians compare analyses analyses drug companies order make sure drug companies analyzing data accurately studies submitted fda drug companies option submitting data trials publication medical journals unlike fda journals checking raw data thus possible drug companies could selectively report data example selective data reporting would assess depression using four measures suppose two four measures yield statistically significant results favor drug case possible two measures show advantage drug would simply reported paper submitted publication called burying data data suppression selective reporting less euphemistic terms example reader final report journal would assume drug highly effective superior placebo two two depression measures left completely unaware two measures drug advantage sugar pill sadly know prior research data often suppressed manner less severe cases one might switch emphasis placed various outcome measures measure shows positive result allocate lot text discussing result barely mention negative results wait even better way suppress data suppose negative study submitted fda commercial value presenting negative results product indeed makes sense commercial vantage point submit clinical trial shows advantage one drug publication medical journal earns bit good pr honest would course hurt sales drug would please shareholders amoral purely financial view reason publish negative trial results hand science one first things medical student hopefully learns scientists report results scientists physicians media general public date comprehensive understanding scientific findings yes may sound naive science supposed work ideal world back nejm study manufacturers antidepressants playing rules science rules almighty dollar take look table excerpted study fda concluded studies yielded positive results studies published fda found mixed questionable results studies studies six published six others published positive findings studies fda concluded negative three published accurately five published positive findings published summarize positive studies nearly always reported mixed negative studies nearly always either published published manner spun results unreasonably one turn questionable negative finding positive one mentioned report results favorable product sweep remaining results rug overall statistics group prepared fda compare statistics medical journal publications remember physicians trained highly value medical journals storehouse evidence based medicine i borrow quote study authors drug effect size value based published literature higher effect size value based fda data increases ranging well reassuring effect size refers magnitude difference drug placebo note every single drug effect size reported medical literature foundation evidence based medicine greater effect size calculated fda data remember fda data based raw data submitted drug companies thus much less subject bias data drug companies manipulate prior submitting publication medical journal highlights authors positive results likely published studies positive opinion often published way conveyed positive outcome found efficacy drug class less would gleaned examination published literature alone according published literature results nearly trials antidepressants positive contrast fda analysis trial data showed roughly half trials positive results statistical significance study results strongly associated whether reported association independent sample size i say one time every single drug inflated effect size medical literature comparison data held fda move layman terms moment manufacturers every single drug appear cheated pie sky statistics review medical literature foundation evidence based medicine much optimistic effects antidepressants accurate marketing trumping science drugs found increased effects result selective publication data manipulation bupropion wellbutrin citalopram celexa duloxetine cymbalta escitalopram lexapro fluoxetine prozac mirtazapine remeron nefazodone serzone paroxetine paxil sertraline zoloft venlafaxine effexor every single drug approved fda depression many tales data suppression spinning found data reported participants abilify study data hidden years negative zoloft ptsd study suicide attempts vanishing prozac study long delay reporting negative results effexor youth depression study data abilify study spun dizzying fashion proverbial lipstick pig trove questionable practices involving key opinion leader corcept heavily spins negative antidepressant trial results props wall street journal david armstrong keith winstein particular new york times benedict carey quickly getting important story people seem unmoved story indeed people crying unfair portrayal drug industry curious take situation coming later i close question say key opinion leaders whose names appear authors published clinical trials data reported inaccurately
