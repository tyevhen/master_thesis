may want hold patient day two observe clarify whether safe case person deprived civil right without due process th hour amendment brought firearms night passed state senate nothing mentioned doctor patient confidentiality necessary psychiatric treatment ensue point made times using day cutoff reporting would affect eating disorder patients dangerous i think point reporting voluntary patients forces physicians violate doctor patient confidentiality necessary psychiatric treatment deprives people mental illness civil right singles psychiatric patients group people deprived civil rights without legal due process terribly stigmatizing may well serve opposite intended effect leave people fearful psychiatrists less willing get help striking hb applies mental health professionals health care provider asked report dangerousness i really sure end day voluntary inpatient reporting still part bill passed senate twice mentioned removed need move terminology mentally ill dangerous reason amazing nothing substance abuse go eight rehabs still arsenal terms actual safety issues i think might helpful though i imagine late process physicians allowed opposed required violate confidentiality police required investigate confiscate weapons quick legal process would ensue return weapons confiscated error could used psychiatric patients substance abusers simply angry mean people making threats behaving erratically would reporting database might serve mechanism get guns hands illegally something none legislation addresses read thank eleven hours yesterday i needed vent really
