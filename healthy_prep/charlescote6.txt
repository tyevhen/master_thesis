personally beats hippies i think chronicle quite well words ancient division stayers strayers yes i wanted show era complexity tend bifurcated equally misleading characterizations sixties early seventies either david horowitz newt gingrich approach demonize counterculture antiwar movement blame current troubles legacy opposite viewing era day glo colored glasses i glad psychedelia op art show memorial art gallery last fall avoided kind simplification many examples instance i noticed ad seeking volunteer adult mentors local newspaper said remember woodstock share child well course might land jail contributing delinquency minor division stayers strayers limited demographic i suppose america land mobility always tended towards wanderer immigrants collective heroes cowboys astronauts plains indians i remember gary snyder essay several decades ago attacking tendency arguing staying power rooting homestead course also counter tendency america wendell berry even charles olson line criticized american tendency run moon things got complicated process writing memoir poems consult old journals recollection project come years way i think certain power much distance event actual writing talk i consult newspaper internet sources mayday protests albuquerque uprising i much written material left period i moved many times one piece serendipity best friend high school tony deceased book dedicated couple years ago found old cassette made interviewing me cross country hitchhiking trip made cd me proved quite valuable road chapter also helped me voice poems i also fortunate find old written journals though many i wish i saved one prose poem cowboy days actually culled longer prose piece i written i sent original michael rothenberg big bridge magazine publish online version book asked extraordinary historical document might printed verbatim michael prudent say well maybe could edit first larger point i agree distance helped i tried writing events many

book blurb road ghosts aside lifesavers intrigues me always gab gets me trouble still true i particularly interested aesthetic writing say little much eloquence right teach know read ah great question i sure one teach except example sensibility comes years reading writing though like everything else pick sooner later i think took me thirty years get groove i still learning i guess makes me particularly slow learner gab great word like poet i attracted vernacular especially good mouth feel sets me thinking whitman blab pave something i always try listen also seamus heaney great poem digging says cold smell potato mold squelch slap soggy peat curt cuts edge living roots awaken head i spade follow men like follow must plodding way sweet time southern hospitality made me think gregory orr memoir blessing incarceration stint teen civil rights volunteer fact matter could easily murdered talk part experience one i read southern hospitality little poem near beginning i get lost hitchhiking rural virginia dc protests gas station owner stereotypical cracker tells me hopes i never get home hit home me precariousness situation sure references similar hitchhiking situations book people swerving me throwing bottles window kentucky hills getting picked klansman east texas fortunately tried convert me rather assault me younger forty would grasp polarized country late sixties early seventies part reason camaraderie share love woodstock spirit conversely longhairs considered white niggers needed stick together especially rural areas amusing song one country rock bands early

today long haired dope smoker might well belong tea party i love myth making takes place song wandering owsley collaboration susan deer cloud color orange way i happen love oranges scurvy never problem me talk collaboration process myth making poetry talk hitchhiking i think relevant discussion especially mention joseph campbell masks god orange poem refers course orange sunshine mentioned explicitly poem sunshine night also frank hara poem i painter contains lines much orange words terrible orange life collaboration something susan i came email lark really i chance read alternating stanzas couple occasions including bug jar book launch time gas tended responsible upbeat fairy tale lines mine tended darker ones together i think hit nice balance depicting sixties dream hard crash

paradise road carlos castaneda persona probably good narrative reason story told p v bumbler sidekick rather strong hero watson rather holmes tension men women sexual revolution well known irony one bring light especially well worth take versus changed decades especially perspective college professor well poem attempt give accurate account incidents may helped contribute start albuquerque riot uprising i consult newspaper accounts time refresh memory dates forth punchline poem comments new consciousness la raza largely chicano uprisings la albuquerque echoed poem ethnicity gender though line referring county jail girls sexually assaulted guards guys left alone boredom stir antithesis sums nicely greater risk women road street taking time i consider myself feminist i really read much gender issues shared lot chauvinistic attitudes i grown absorbed bikers i hung really strong women like woman called scorpio subject another poem found victimized male dominated culture despised strong women sad say much difference counter cultural males cops rednecks i think stokely carmichael said place women movement prone glad worked dylan collection simple twist fate tell me story green jacket much implications thanks hope i get sued prose poem reflects single fact losing denim jacket i checked visitor center grand canyon hiking colorado river heat i got back center locked ride leaving i forfeit jacket series implications i dramatize cause effect chain point butterfly effect similar mathematical models one changes one small variable tremendous differences may result line i reflect whether given freedom withstand cold nights represented jacket i might decided extend journey three months perhaps heading great northwest perhaps entirely different life i eschewed college homecoming like might compare contrast soldiers coming home war well me much better soldiers coming back far stereotype hippies spitting vets heroes first people i smoked dope vvaw activists front line demo folks would meet homeless camp shelter i knew something anguish second hand certainly stories country joe mcdonald way one performers really told stories worked veteran rights people remember fish cheer woodstock homecoming emotional lots tears part part parents back high school i achieved kind mythic stature one else history catholic school done anything equivalent easy maybe bit easy college i start confronting darker side fool heartiness many decisions people i hurt etc i ever repentant conventional sense i still believe actions necessary response conditions life point
