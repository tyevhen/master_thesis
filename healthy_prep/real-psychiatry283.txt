recent comment observation normal function human memory could explain considered obvious lies prompted reading suggestion author suggested i read book called junk neuroscience satel book i could find similar title brainwashed seductive appeal mindless neuroscience i reluctant spend good money polemics i get much polemic i want reading free internet turns i familiar author work frontiers psychiatry series i reviewed last year presenting cme course lecture neurobiology addiction currently papers collected including satel lilienfeld somewhat ironic entire series based i would see assumptions faulty historical medical certainly neurobiological premise much th century theories addictive behavior motivation polarized two models first model viewed addiction moral failure addicts rightly held responsible judged accordingly second model contrast viewed addiction specific brain disease caused neurobiological adaptations occurring response chronic drug alcohol use addicts choice control first lines captures main problem debates topic particularly pernicious comes addiction neuroscience leads number false observations seem cropping popular press increased frequency observation addictions spontaneously remit taken evidence require treatment neurobiological factors need considered idea heavy drinker without alcoholic suggesting heavy drinking protective factors leading excessive mortality morbidity alcoholism arguments lead back idea addiction either choice bad habit gross oversimplifications complex decision making affected addictions one main diagnostic systems addiction american society addiction medicine asam describes addiction addiction primary chronic disease brain reward motivation memory related circuitry however suggest addicts choice control fact much treatment addiction depends step recovery model designed help learn new controls improve social affiliation engineer living environments remove triggers relapse learning affiliation cravings relapse triggers neurobiological substrates backdrop papers offered satel lilienfeld one i happen fortunate enough work residential center specializes treating addictions addition clinical work i present number lectures graduate students physicians residents residents primary care psychiatry two slides follow right powerpoint neurobiology addiction theories addiction slide intended rapid survey addiction theories i put warm free associate theories slide example i look nutritional deficiency theory alcohol look alcohol considered medicine correlates per capita alcohol consumption i build point looking cultural factors affect per capita alcohol consumption uk i might ask groups physicians self medication legitimate theory addiction practically physicians heard listen doc ca something pain depression anxiety insomnia i know i make go away hours everybody room also knows long run none symptoms syndromes disorders treated fact many become considerably worse result drug alcohol use even example availability proneness i typically use partially accounts addiction approach neurobiology account pathways recovery well pathways addiction treatment centers pathways based learning interventions i digress talk learning occurs addiction process recovery process i start kandel example classic new england journal medicine article plasticity original example talks two people room psychotherapy session brain changes occur result session people leave room brains changed discussion experience dependent changes brain brief introduction brings me four considerations neurobiology lecture listed second slide i think fairly basic starting points lectures neurobiology proceed talk number systems structures thought important neurobiological standpoint i bring concept nobody knows works together brief discussion chalmers hard problem fact know anyone unique conscious state comes implies i evolving new lecture looks complex decision making roots neuroanatomical structures i discuss lecture studying field i consider fun brings together number concepts previous scientific studies i would probably focused i practicing clinical psychiatry retired i first admit i trained neuroscientist i trained science worked scientific research brings me satel lilienfeld paper i know either author read paper definitely well written references bolded statement text begins saying paper excerpted book brainwashed seductive appeal mindless neuroscience far i know book would apparently straighten views neuroscience author begin brain disease model implies erroneously brain necessarily important useful level analysis understanding treating addiction build rapidly second short brain disease model obscures dimension choice addiction capacity respond incentives also essential fact people use drugs reasons consistent self medication hypothesis working addiction treatment center talking thousands people career severe addictions leads me explosion associations whenever i see broad generalizations problem i know concept disease means affected organ system necessarily important useful level analysis seem me many diseases true issue reasons take drugs seldom rational author suggest classic example one i frequently use lecturing current opioid epidemic significant portion population prone get hypomanic euphorigenic effect taking opioids nonpsychiatrists mean person becomes extremely euphoric energetic productive socially outgoing initial night two may engage work creative activities rate surprises many say i thought i become person i always wanted carefully interviewing person several months later get description developed tolerance effect taking opioid stay well prevent withdrawal symptoms koob described cycle chronic relapsing syndrome moves impulse control disorder involving positive reinforcement compulsive disorder involving negative reinforcement consistent definition drug positive euphoria negative prevents withdrawal reinforcing effects reason take drug addiction specific match drug effects specific nervous system even case addictive drugs taken reasons long list often due fact drug perceived magical qualities rationalization continuing addiction i could make similar arguments main points paper i laid following table authors provide ample details examples support contentions part problem concept disease complex try dissect problems become apparent problem disease disease complex decision making people focus considered disease reader come conditions consider diseases many ten points easiest points involving clearest comparisons disease cases point seems somewhat arbitrary chronic illnesses usually possible function limited incapacity due illness late stages cases critique unique capacity organ anything else example point emergent properties less obvious considered property electrical tissue cardiac tissue produce electrical patterns decreasing complexity heart ages affected disease brain produce similar pattern see supplementary difference heart tissue unable produce conscious state two points minimize role systems involved complex decision making trivial matter associated addictive behaviors lead people classify alcohol drug use disorders diseases common examples include people unable stop using drugs alcohol despite life threatening illnesses repeated pleas family members repeated problems relationships employment law deaths due addiction common impact large population much likely see condition disease know killed somebody point curious argument past several years i attended seminars showing example trials buprenorphine maintenance opioid use disorders addition counseling adds nothing outcome beyond medication i personally believe i used seeing people severe addiction stop taken using environment every residential treatment center i aware main focus personal agency whether step recovery alcoholics anonymous narcotics anonymous methods psychological change part process often focus neurobiology excuse explanation people become somebody never thought could become process reversed reason focus neurobiology medication assisted treatment discussion medications might work part informed consent interest part patients i wonder best characterization going philosophy neuroscience i previously pointed critique philosopher attack psychiatry straw man approach used suggested something true field proceeded attack true confronted single fact asked evidence support contention people supporting contention drew apparent blank day far i know rational way argue apa implicit position dsm teaches people live lives even i write page absurd yet form argument current paper much sophisticated points limitations disease concept used rhetorically proceeds eschew refer neurocentric view addiction i think argument carries day largely little evidence people know neuroscience adverse effects authors suggest plenty evidence neuroscientist clinicians focused multiple levels care i lot say disease diseases complex decision making i going stop look topics addressed individual posts future meantime read neuroscience addiction field added brain neuroscience discipline past three decades i think additional explanation intent reply necessary i use term political lot referring editorials rhetoric polemics people know better seem respond lot articles though either truth facts happen support viewpoint i like science dry i ascribe pigliucci observation science process truth occurs end long process series approximations seeing way shuts process left something
