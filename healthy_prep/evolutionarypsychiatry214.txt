often happens one takes closer look references one paper another one find paper far superior first glass half empty view one regret wasting time inferior paper glass half full hey i material another post i stack papers queue industrious researchers coming time material really problem even blog entries let go peppy ish music today know two door cinema club right click new tab great thing superior paper free full text well worth taking look avena et al sugar fat bingeing notable differences addictive like behavior published journal nutrition symposium food addiction fact fiction wrote convincing work one caveat paper primarily review rat studies brand new paper i blogged last week stuck humans mri one first humans showing neural correlates addiction chocolate milkshakes definitely work done stick fork declare answers said let visit rat studies people rats tend binge highly palatable energy rich food binge episodes research clinical experience usually involve episodes bread pasta followed frequency sweets fatty foods salty snacks salty snacks typically chips popcorn part grains salt vegetable oil prefer binge sweet food tend binge frequently bingeing i mean hanging couch eating half bag doritos watching old episodes top chef binge eating humans specific definition larger amount food normal within hour period associated least three following eating uncomfortably full eating large amounts food hungry eating rapidly normal eating alone due embarrassment amount food consumed feeling disgusted depressed guilty amount food consumed distress anxiety regarding binge eating obviously rats fill questionnaires feel eating i assuming rat definition quite strict i would call issue problem animal models binge eating i know rats feel guilty consuming human definition important remember obese people binge eaters however binge eaters far likely obese people medical treatment obesity struggle binge eating binge eating extreme overall issue obesity west somehow food consumption gets unhooked energy regulatory cycles kept relatively lean generations emotional baggage addiction boot back rats many laboratories done studies sugar solutions find general rats binge sugar given intermittent access given sugar period fasting typically sugar solutions similar sugar concentration soft drinks rats sugar regular diet available time tend eat much sugar restricted rats binge importantly sugar bingeing rats sugar regular food freely available rats tend get fat eat sugar compensate eating less rat food contrary notion binge fat alone rats certainly corwin et al demonstrated several times rats ready access rat food binge shortening available hours day i myself never experienced overwhelming urge bucket crisco come think one papers notes humans rarely ever binge pure fat proving least diet obesity researchers functioning brains sticktoitiveness corwin less repeated experiment trans fat free shortening years later rats binge new improved crisco old deadly version like sugar eating rats rats tend compensate extra crisco binge least week experiments eating less regular rat chow second song crystal vases last royals another group rat researchers leaving stone unturned compared intermittently available crisco i know trans fat crisco corwin paper noted trouble getting hold trans fat crisco time comparison group rats given high fat diet i could find exact composition high fat diet every rat diet i could find dyets inc researchers obtained rat food uses soybean oil corn oil fat every third day weeks groups would binge fat one group pure crisco high fat food mix groups gained fat though necessarily gain weight hydrogenated shortening exposed group changes leptin levels leptin levels increased common obesity suggests least rats hydrogenated vegetable oil potential endocrine disruptive plain old vegetable oil groups gained body fat knows researchers also groups rats got high fat diet every day control diet every day crisco every day none groups intermittent constant exposure control differences amount calories consumed intermittently exposed rats bingeing behavior high fat crisco rats intermittently exposed gained body fat waiting sweet fat mixes combination sweet fat activates cornucopia taste receptors neuropeptide signaling systems sweet fat combos researchers use cookies avena paper used research diets sucrose soybean oil i guessing industrial lard intermittent access result bingeing rats rats consuming daily calories hour sweet fat food available window rats tend eat less regular rodent chow compensate compared control groups without sweet fat access actually eat calories overall first model results rats gaining body weight bingeing behavior rats least sugar alone causes binges intermittently available vegetable fat high vegetabe fat diets causing body fat increase without overall weight gain sweet fat mix though finally using lard combination soybean oil industrial lard undoubtedly higher omega content pasture pig lard i think around pufa causes bingeing weight gain interesting things avena paper rats given daily intermittent access sugar binge first hour sugar access rats given high dose naloxone injectable opiate blocker used humans overdoses end someone breathing abrupt opiate withdrawal alive extremely unhappy uncomfortable exhibit symptoms opiate withdrawal similar signs rat opiate withdrawal emerge spontaneously sugar bingeing rats put hour fast naloxone necessary sugar bingeing rats given regular diet weeks eat sugar ever two weeks without sugar addicted rats fix taken away also anxious aggressive lower body temperature sign rat stress similar findings using naloxone seen rats fed ad libitum cafeteria style diet variety foods cheese cookies chocolate chips rats exposed corn oil show increase dopamine feel good chemical release release also happen exposed taste oil avena group tried replicate findings variety sweet fat high fat combinations rodent chow observe naloxone withdrawal effect interesting another ding ding moment avena group found withdrawal unhappiness sugar bingeing rats hour fast tried thing rats fed high fat diet i sure typical horrid industrial rodent chow observed rats anxious indications distress hours without food researchers felt due sugar stimulating opiate systems fat likely i also wonder high fat rodents able burn ketones experience uncomfortable fluctuations energy high carb typically industrial sugar corn starch casein lactose soybean oil blah blah blah combination rat tend without eating take home message rats binge sugar vegetable fat sugar fat combination detrimental rat body fat seems sugar packs addictive punch increase vegetable fat particularly crisco whether trans fat free combination rest industrial diet perhaps causes metabolic harm information apply humans well differences i lack human crisco diving behavior many similarities gluten grains seem missing animal studies humans binge eating behaviors binge commonly bread pasta know i think already eat real food avoid industrial stuff particularly vegetable oils really play safe avoid gluten grains i go far way avoid much sugar personally avoiding processed food general trick i eat fruit i feel like usually bananas berries grapes apples oranges also typical usually ends one serving day i cook recipes sugar often i cut sugar recipe calls i tend use raw honey specialty ingredient expensive precious fun eat easier savor i current little bear raw honey months worried much fructose use rice syrup i sweat little ketchup tomato paste balsamic vinegar never much food amazing celebration nature technological marvel unless enjoying high end meal molecular gastronomy restaurant real food enjoyed celebrated life giving nourishing never enemy i also new post psychology today depression crashed party
