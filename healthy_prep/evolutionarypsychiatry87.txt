two heavily publicized papers came past week time fodder questions talk evolutionary psychiatry alzheimer dementia upcoming week ever heard adagio spartacus hang little bit around get early rendition one romantic themes classical music repeated greater power later ballet russian composers really knew sock good theme say rat researchers ucla well excepting good friend ahs president aaron blaisdell jury still researchers pulled interesting things though little study rats 'metabolic syndrome brain deficiency omega fatty acid exacerbates dysfunctions insulin receptor signaling cognition paper combines everything awesome evil rat study fructose dha mazes authors even begin paper abstract highlighted key points provide novel evidence effects metabolic dysfunctions brain function using rat model metabolic syndrome induced high fructose intake etc rats two diets two drinks group gets regular rat chow omega water drink group gets regular rat chow omega fructose drink instead water group gets water omega deficient diets i doubt easy make human wild quite omega deficient rats group gets double whammy omega deficient diet fructose solution diets go weeks time pretty remarkable change fructose slurping rates fructosed rats drink lot plain water drinking rats even though eat less food plain water rats take calories end weeks fructosed rats high glucose insulin levels triglyceride levels poor group given fructose omega deficient diet twice levels group omega food water researchers found omega diet seemed protect group rats little fructose less weight gain less rat metabolic syndrome rats also trained go maze fructose poisoned omega depleted rats worse groups remembering get maze lost maze race big time rats fructose omega relatively preserved maze solving abilities researchers measured specific elements rats bodies brains experiment measures energy metabolism decreased poor group whereas omega seemed increase energy metabolism chemicals known important ability nerves adapt change according different stimuli called synaptic plasticity decreased omega deficient rats much decreased fructose poisoned omega deficient rats group rats omega fructose protection bad effects fructose surprisingly omega deficient rats decreased amount dha brain increased amount omega fats metabolites like arachidonic acid fructose excess well known cause metabolic syndrome hypertension hypertriglyceridemia hyperinsulinemia typical symptoms know metabolic syndrome affects brain well course plenty rat studies showing downing vast quantities coca cola fructose pretty lousy idea one cares one liver brain i recommend segment hbo weight nation series liver good bit halfway next segment sugar sweetened drinks proven fructose bad context excess calorie diet omega protective main point deprive rats omega sugar indeed make dumb context excess calorie diet eating lab rat chow completely devoid omega make even dumber i recommend see modern processed food diet mimic changes soda juice red bull sweetened beverage choice lack omega happy liver brain make changes occur quickly second diet dementia study week involving actual humans however another observational study hospital i academically attached participants women health study female health care professionals filled food frequency questionnaire baseline beginning five years later older sub cohort women underwent serial cognitive testing via telephone course additional four years data gathered statisticians went work women underwent cognitive testing three times time st rd test average years women tended better second time first time learned tests going end four years scores dropped women second third test declined women ate saturated fat actually test scores continued improve women consumed monounsaturated fat associations total fat trans fat polyunsaturated fat mostly omega cognitive change time pull covarites mell hess saturated fat intake associated lower rates high cholesterol way statinization part study occurred statins came late lipitor biggest selling one i believe released though hard tell women statins would automatically put hypercholesterolemia group total cholesterol used make group many frustrating things way data presented study mufa olive oil consumption also correlated lower total cholesterol women known cardiovascular disease history myocardial infarction stroke coronary artery bypass stenting taken data trend remained similar total fat intake associated lower exercise smoking higher bmi previous epidemiology studies linked saturated fat intake poorer cognitive function time main difference study health care professionals much lower total trans fat intakes average american trans fats previously associated poorer cognitive function epidemiological studies trans fat consumption tracks saturated fat consumption paper little brief heavy statistical mumbo jumbo bother much coming mechanisms recommend mediterranean diet end immediately classifies pufas mufas good fats saturated fats trans fats bad fats discussion i think comes find women chowing saturated fats going women less likely take care health ways olive oil fans also educated even olive oil starting popular likely take best care i surprised see correlations i still ca figure saturated fat cause cognitive decline mechanistically i find interesting highest saturated fat eaters lower levels hypercholesterolemia large group paper makes attempt whatsoever explain finding hmmmm
