thrilled success ancestral health influenced diet lifestyle happy extol benefits rooftops buying copies paleo solution primal blueprint friends relatives patients clients may hurt confused folks ignored continued complain issues problems thought might helped little diet lifestyle tweak hint grains vast amounts soda might contributing tummy pains understanding stages change model help direct interventions energies productive manner proposing big change hurt feelinged fantastic ideas rejected five basic stages big lifestyle change giving addiction changing one diet first stage called precontemplation addiction circles sometimes referred denial precontemplation really thinking changing diet drinking habits lifestyle habits many folks see me first time stage many friends family since precontemplation often characterized denial saying hey really stop eating wheat see stomach pains skin problems get better often met responses well i love bread i always eat whole grains healthy brother eats bread stomach skin issues someone precontemplation phase recommendation dramatic change often met arguing side best strategy urge someone immediately towards action fourth stage change rather towards next stage contemplation move someone precontemplation contemplation best approach personal one might ask person thought symptoms anything diet poor sleep smoking whatever major lifestyle problem important support person understanding current dilemma say yeah maybe i eat many donuts might say oh yes i know donuts smell good definitely hard give know taste good sometimes one sweet believe sometimes folks stay precontemplation time understanding circumstances cause move forward serving supportive example continuing highlight possible issues problems might caused bad habits i noticed always bronchitis winter think due smoking continue nudge person towards contemplation short personalized nudging seems work better often time less frustration got stop smoking kill check smoking cessation website next stage contemplation fun starts person welcome support going forward next stage preparation contemplator still ambivalent denial person may welcome stories anecdotes successful life transformations links various resources next stage preparation folks calling gym ask prices class times newbies stumbling onto mark daily apple support encouragement resources key

protocols reduced cost free personal training session supportive check email would come play around time addition obviously life different massive lifestyle change percocet comfort day anymore sometimes feel overwhelming even though longer spending day habit friends family started trust maybe uncomfortable attention get losing pounds might feel distant friends family embrace change might even explicitly unconsciously prod go back old habits fought hard drop maintenance easily go stage addiction called relapse many respects maintenance requires support previous stages problems obvious lost pounds look amazing may feel uncomfortable someone spent years self conscious body dealing excess skin issues maintenance may look little different less magical final product imagined preparation stage i never sports illustrated swimsuit model example matter many wholes met cons i underlying theme support type support needed differs one progresses stages change providing wrong type support wrong time alienating putting push someone wrong direction matter well meaning spending one energy providing wrong support frustrating lead ruptures relationships hopefully post helpful anyone heard
