recent work tamas pataki tells quite recent philosophical attempts gardner brakel lear hopkins et al rescue justice freudian wish fulfilment kleinian omnipotent phantasy offering sub intentional pre propositional accounts phenomena often superfluous since everyday scheme intentional belief desire explanations action often suffice long comprehended true depths pataki gives best account wish fulfilment petocz gives best account symbolism australians really sewing whole field oh i ought note following thoughts based reading pataki paper book edited boag brakel talvitie rather monograph pataki describes wish fulfilling phantasy sort found dreams daydreams psychotic delusions hallucinatory gratifications actualisations transference acting etc described freud terms wishful representation wishes fulfilled creation beliefs wishes fulfilled latter interesting notion nobody ever doubted sometimes like imagine wishes fulfilled motivating daydreamers neurotics possibility achieving frustrating recognition mere imagination rather temporary 'substitutive satisfaction fantasising pataki describes reasons gardner et al tend opt sub intentional non agential brutely causal accounts dynamic wish fulfilment cluster around difficulties allegedly attendant idea unconscious yet purposive action think sartre regress argument inner censors must know know something time pataki however holds freud intentionalist explanation wish fulfilling phenomena masturbatory fantasy parapraxes play art lucid dreams contrast say normal dreaming infantile wish fulfilment defences way much self deception intelligible form self consolation i motivated quelling psychic pain make case promise intentionalism pataki invites consider following case sandlers patient successful scientist field came analysis amongst things severe work problem could fact produce work required made several notable contributions field previously analysis years beginning current analysis seemed well known factors causing work difficulty sort present need delay getting work till last minute quite clearly oedipal problem could allow feel satisfied oedipal sexual aggressive wishes working well also seen part anal retentive tendency persisted life analysis fear success need hold last moment many elements clearly related work problems give greater insight eventually significant function symptom became clear allowing get state anxiety creating feeling great internal pressure time passed work done could recreate degree almost hallucinatory intensity feeling nagged even screamed mother became clear used symptom experience object relationship one wished sado masochistic relationship mother actualised however present simple sexualisation anxiety real need feel secure experiencing earlier relationship mother even though pay rather painful price sandler sandler pp patient says may assume good reason wants experience mother presence painful sure satisfying patient overriding need security attachment wish fulfilling end scientist mother present achieved non intentionally notice panic scientist manufactures product single stroke would find endless procrastination strolling eating veritable programme postponement words strategy invades less every corner life intentional projects thousand intentional acts pointing direction response i find myself thinking yes accept along sandlers patient intentionally making excitedly anxious argument goes rather well question whether find unconscious intentional explanation satisfactory general also affect kind motivational meaning disposed ascribe particular case thus chap may experience idea fluent success anxiogenic since threatens perversely comforting identification punitive mother risking wrath branches accomplished action anxiety could however simply i non intentionally cause diverse procrastinatory self soothing anxiety discharging behaviours may diverse procrastinations intended ways secure professional failure rather provide momentary relief fear thought success engenders knits together perhaps unity singular purpose unity fear causes reading i wonder i influenced jonathan lear thinking repetition compulsion says compulsion repeat repetitiveness effects desired repetition merely caused failure overcome problem old failing solution absence others endlessly attempted post script tamas responded me nice question sanders patient choose ways procrastinating suggesting understand patient choice kinds behaviour take account understanding consequences acting thus counter would yes start taking procrastinatory behaviours chosen want know rightly choices chosen yes psychoanalytic account give good way answering question i suggest maybe properly described done without yet properly described chosen one ca always ask purposes behaviour done like rather like much behaviour function morphology training identifications classical conditioning etc every behaviour chosen performed ways always best thought chosen really question deep purposes go i follow general hermeneutic tack thinking best serve psychoanalytic thinking never ascribing intentionality absolutely necessary well goes without saying i think much often necessary say cbt pundit inclined think i think another interesting point let accept sandlers pataki procrastinatory behaviour effect merely quelling anxiety also positively rewarding enacts comforting perverse object relation even rather thinking unconscious choice motivation might serve well enough mere concept conditioning person ends behaviour reinforcement contingencies operative rather aiming achieving goal thinking really interesting i suggest non factive question feel need lose patience notion like 'unconscious choice rate i straying little original purpose writing post instead think first importance entering debates becoming clear possible marks intendedness considering whether unconsciously motivated action intended rather start assumption confidently know without reflectively specify action intentional straight consider question whether unconscious intentional activity i want look prior question means talk intentionality seem me two typical marks intentionality first way someone diverse behaviour coheres around telos seen answering desire etc geoff gets walks fridge picking beer sits back much grasp action defining telos i intentionality given simply appreciation shape fact would odd suggest smoothly performed temporally extended action non intentional matter provide evidence intendedness rather needing provide specific defeating conditions someone trance ascription intendedness go automatically second someone says ask something anscombe puts distinguishes actions intentional answer i shall suggest actions certain sense question given application sense course answer positive gives reason acting intention p answers question provided agent asked 'so fact human beings one conditions shape discourse intention takes two marks tend hang together rather consistently least much time may perhaps partly explicable terms innate wiring i rather suspect mainly comes ways enculturation development inculcate binding structure nudged initiation diverse discourses regarding accountability towards implicitly governed constitutive constituting ideal coherence avowal action probably i plagiarising julia tanney however philosophers talk whether intentions conscious unconscious way tend take question terms whether someone aware intention question idea seems i able avow intentions i i inwardly conscious course automatically contradicts i claimed actually one two marks intentionality namely someone says response 'why question yeah yeah philosophers would probably claim i logical behaviourist i hand claim hyperbolic mentalists like ryle least i trying reduce specifying sufficient conditions mind behaviour really odd call logical behaviourists whole idea inner awareness however seems me make big mess things simply reason i possibly imagine really typically construe avowals intentions desires along lines quasi perceptual judgements desires intentions judgements avowals beliefs vide looming infinite regress i avow belief straight ca i avow desire intention straight phenomenological evidence much grammatical counter evidence support construing avowals desires intentions reportative based epistemic appraisal right wrong things stand whole idea radically self alienated beggars belief i tell desire intention i typically speak rather speak directly desire intention interesting depth psychologists sometime inability speak basis shape dispositions otherwise express otherwise appears warrantably ascribable desire intention cases call cases 'unconscious desire intention i suggest simply fact people sometimes go disjunctive manner simply fact guarantee metaphysical neurological perfect match talking walking perspective libet et al observation directed action temporally outrun avowal seems interesting idea illusory illusion caused foisting onto discourse intention epistemic apparatus introspection rather little i i think hugely influenced john hyman paper blindsight saying 'simply fact i denying fact matter alleged fact whether person actually standard issue intention got partially put reach instead i suggesting encounter ontological rather alleged epistemic feature call 'unconscious intention 'being existential phenomenologist would put unconscious intention different regular intention unconscious intentions marked peculiar absence avowal creature unlike infant perfectly capable avowals non complex related instances set stall i want come back pataki deploying critique thinking unconsciously intended pataki like freud makes reference concept unconscious belief case consideration one freud girl ca go sleep night unless pillow touching bedstead freud understanding oedipal jealousy girl wants separate mother father believes separating masculine bedstead feminine pillow separate separates could objected mad believe one mother pillow one father bedstead mad beliefs ca ascribed whilst still continuing job helping make sense pataki rightly insists identity proposition content unconscious belief rather something like 'if i separate pillow bedstead i separated parents believing proposition presuppose believing parents identical furniture sorcerer sticks pins effigy believe effigy enemy distinction underlying difference one thing operationally symbolising another thing believed identical circumstances distinguished third one thing functionally equated another segalian symbolic equation identity beliefs symbolism proper symbolic equation i understand right pataki saying whilst may 'as stage middle 'i wish separate parents i achieve i done i believe wish fulfilled affect cogency ascription final belief although presumably affect cogency belief i come back next point pataki makes following freud hallucinatory wish fulfilment succeeds regressively draws primary process thought following way withdrawing attention reality nothing contradicts hallucinated fulfilment wish belief reality hallucination 'goes straight sake discussion let accept something right freud account girl oedipal anxieties causing obsession pillow i myself find perfectly plausible think baulk tend simply rather unacquainted shape presence character unconscious phantasy take long time patience working several defences start get one eye dimension human life unless one one appreciation freudian account probably bogus based merely theoretical emotionally dishonest idealising grasp difference i see myself pataki uncomfortable attributing belief identity pillow mother girl comfortable attributing belief wish mother father kept separate sense satisfied whereas i i feel less uncomfortable latter former basic gripe seems me obvious fact matter whether girl believes separating pillow headboard effecting separation parents thus ask may well say either 'no i believe could work 'oh goodness yes i somehow dreaming believing 'i think yes sense believe summarise glibly voodoo would work senses closer get thinking belief sometimes rightly governed constitutive principle rationality la davidson get wanting speak girl believing action could satisfy wish believing wish temporarily satisfied closer get conception belief emotional bodily action tendencies asking certain questions situation others closer get wanting talk belief allow play partitive ideas selfhood disposed save rationality thereby extent rationality constraint speaking save belief i see anything could make me think proximities make greater respectful accuracy playing language game belief ascription rather surely reflect kind indeterminacy obtains game truth i think best answer girl would something like 'oh yes i kind think bit like reporting something dreamed believed someone says 'in dream i thought i believe telling actually thought something dreamt thought something cf malcolm dreaming important point seems me grammar dreaming phantasising moment give propositional articulation unless one psychotic delirious also moment insight release mental structuration past tense 'i kind think obligatory note psychotic never avows beliefs tell cia believe cia i want avoid misunderstanding someone might say me 'oh anti realist beliefs coherentist taking reality belief consist merely explanatory work positing achieve think dennett well i saying pointing ways criteria belief come apart i pointing diverse criteria actually unlike take granted intuitively know think specifying reality belief consists pointing disjuncts noting somewhat exceptional indeterminate cases let imagine someone trying keep separate two allegedly different scenarios first girl really believe wish effected allow go sleep second somewhat girl believes wish effected go sleep well would tell cases apart i mean question epistemic spirit i mean rather putative difference actually consist look i want give me story separate selves point would metaphysics disreputable sense term i want know practical difference ascription conditions seems me good dialectical reason ought hopkins opt talk 'pacification rather 'fulfilment unconscious wish reason hallucinatory wish fulfilment abrogation reality testing kind way might falsely reporting creating illusions mess
