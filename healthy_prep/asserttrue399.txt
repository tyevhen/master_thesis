erwin chargaff first report amount adenine dna equals amount thymine amount guanine equals amount cytosine result instrumental helping watson crick rosalind franklin determine structure dna pretty easy understand every one strand dna pairs strand every pairs opposite strand explains dna complementarity associated replication model somewhere along line chargaff credited much less obvious rule even individual strands dna paired anything called second parity rule attributed chargaff although i ca find record chargaff postulated rule chargaff papers often cited supporting rule particular paper series culminating report pnas fact offer rule read papers carefully chargaff colleagues actually found one strand dna heavier label strands 'h 'l heavy light chargaff et al reported consistent difference purine content strands see table paper i interviewed linus pauling cautioned me always read results section paper carefully people often conclude something entirely different results actually showed cite paper showing abc data actually showed xyz right rate turns message strand gene hardly ever contains equal amounts purines pyrimidines codon analysis reveals genes become richer content content goes excess purines message strand becomes larger larger depicted following graph shows message strand purine content plotted content distinct bacterial species species represented twice codon analysis reveals content increases message strand purine content increases point graph represents unique bacterial species quite obvious content approximately bacterial species message strand tends comparatively purine rich message strand becomes pyrimidine rich purine rich note bacteria dna coding regions codon derived content close whole genome content i checked species graphed found whole chromosome differ codon derived average less parts correlation purine content strong r still see quite points drifted far regression line especially region lots points lie going organisms i decided investigating first basics time transition mutations gc change organism content thus move along axis graph transitions move organism higher lower graph definition transitions affect strandwise purine balance transversions hand affect strandwise purine balance theory least occur often one strand dna i say occur often fixed often one strand versus example let say transversions common kind transversion probably true given guanine easily oxidized four bases given fact failure repair oxoguanine lesions lead eventual replacement thymine let say transversions likely occur non transcribed strand dna transcription time non transcribed strand uncoiled unprotected transcription taking place strand time non transcribed strand would lose guanines replaced thymines message strand rna synonymous strand also non transcribed strand would become pyrimidine rich strand would become purine rich unfortunately exactly happens organisms content precisely opposite happens purines accumulate message strand organisms fact high organisms purine content message strands rather extreme explain one possibility organisms evolved extremely effective transversion repair systems message non transcribed strand genes systems effective transversions go unrepaired message strand transcribed strand hand get benefit repair system possibly repair enzymes ca access strand engulfed transcription factors topoisomerases rna polymerase nearby ribosomal machinery etc non transcribed strand never mutates mutations swiftly repaired transcribed strand absence equally effective repairs eventually accumulate mutations message strand accumulate adenines purines perhaps graph notice tiny spur points hangs around points belong bartonella species plus parachlamydia another chlamydial organism endosymbionts lost good portion genomes time seems likely lost transversion repair machinery transcription message strands going unrepaired transversions happen message strand rendering light purines scenario seems plausible least reasoning maybe points far regression line represent organisms gained repair functionality message strands never undergo transversions although transcribed
