right i neanderthal fascinating developments human paleogenetics past decade including characterization genomes hominins including neanderthals denisovans old remains casts different light stories based stereotypes past example common view neanderthals strong intelligent sophisticated beings result homo sapiens could easily outcompete brutes result modern day man surviving species quite surprise learn neanderthal genome characterized portions could identified modern human genome ancient dna may role hla human leukocyte antigen genes play central role immunity related question whether incorporating dna new species could lead certain autoimmune problems fact compounded interest area originally piqued first natgeo genographics project project gave confirmation graphics fact point another years ago ancestors walked rift valley east africa began migrations around globe folks migrating north europe encountered neanderthals denisovans along way contrary conventional story humans outcompeted mated produced offspring quick review relevant taxonomy zoology naming convention genus species modern humans homo sapiens considering convention different species genus homo apart homo sapiens others extinct includes neanderthals homo neanderthalensis denisovans historical terms one time another one homo genus walking earth looking graphic smithsonian suggests homo sapiens homo floresiensis neanderthals homo neanderthalensis denisovans walking earth sometime time zone years ago genetic technology revolutionized area morphology based research lot speculation good conclusions homo sapiens surviving species i know still teach medical school major rotations i taught describe patient first sentence age sex ethnicity based outward appearance various rationales provided opening sentence even medical school long time ago make lot sense me course cultural political influences descriptions year old black male became year old african american male point back depending politically correct term time unscientific many physicians seemed think medically precise way talk patient condense relevant information patient i consider anything beyond male female versus man woman decide notes would never start words facts i capture opening lines actual age patient whether man woman male female non specific terms reflect fact i talking human could say old convention i still see present medical records i review fact stretched cases characterization white people progressed white caucasian european even though person question family set foot europe three four generations i guess i also missed politically correct convention white folks european americans yet i seen frequently medical records i read paper science years ago genetically significant differences based race skin color seemed like surprisingly simple statement authors pointed humans much genetically related one another non human primates genetic differences based skin color facial features trivial non existent look way opening line year old hispanic female becomes little unscientific stereotype include medical record might say provides opportunity delivery culturally appropriate health care case i would suggest including accurate description patients culture described rather presuming culture based physical appearance check standard intake form scientific rather stereotyped descriptions people standard related issue much people actually know family origin average people i talk family histories know high points generations physicians typically focused heritable diseases third fourth generation americans country know much families migrated migrating first humans migrated rift valley east africa years ago generations ago maybe need correct short longevity prehistoric man fact africans start called racial differences byproduct migration huge fact nobody talks far reaching implications i like talk issue happened neanderthals story used neanderthals typical cave men squat muscular bright fate considered extinction outclassed outcompeted homo sapiens paleogenetics led assumptions challenged excellent nova special called decoding neanderthals captures surprise excitement first scientists discovered neanderthal dna human genome program also looks inferences made prehistoric beings based archaeological evidence genetic evidence case archeology complexity neanderthal flint tool technology investigated method making flint tools broad sharp edge could resharpened termed levallois technology complexity suggests higher level intelligence commonly assumed second neanderthal technology discovered using type pitch implements manufacture early epoxy required mastery thermal process suggesting advanced intelligence final piece evidence presence foxp gene gene responsible speech language humans foxp variants neanderthal dna decoded contained copy foxp gene identical modern humans technology fact neanderthals also social beings makes little difficult explain outcompeted homo sapiens i seen theories competition might included direct incorporation large numbers neanderthals directly homo sapiens population numbers neanderthals could incorporated population given current dna percentages i suspect could large use example ancestors i constructed table looking stated ethnicities grandparents maternal grandparents generation longer paternal grandmother still spoke read native language maternal grandfather knew small bits swedish taught me prayer swedish know translation neither i small customs usually celebrations food persisted small degree balance family americanized comparing stated ethnicities grandparents dna markers results couple matches many question marks come time genetics allow better probability statements might inherit disease given fact haplotypes occur less current natgeo database subject maybe depends lot study medical record descriptor presumed ethnicity little related issue science paleogenetics politicized like branch science chris stringer wrote excellent commentary nature observed trend speculating genomes modern others based content ancient dna summarizes well two sentences dna archaic populations others great majority genes morphology behavior derives common african heritage unites take precedence distinguishes current evidence also seems suggest migration africa part story identical foxp gene found neanderthals modern humans suggests common ancestor long african migration currently billion people earth processing power human brain means billion unique conscious states difficult imagine isolated groups humans recent times result different appearances customs practices human characteristic promoting interests groups even point warfare others seems common element human consciousness widespread appreciation distinctions convention might moderate tendency groups see different better groups modern humans leap consciousness hopefully happen future generations george dawson md dfapa
