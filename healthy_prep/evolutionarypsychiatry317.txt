time go back eby eby i inexplicable fondness paper information decent touch unorganized reliance case studies reminds me pleasing way old fashioned papers one john cade use lithium mania i spent much last evening afternoon kids napping reading bunch magnesium depression papers frankly i blown away start untangle effects magnesium nervous system touch upon nearly every single biological mechanism depression i described far archives blog epidemiological studies controlled trials give good reason suspect least moderately deficient magnesium animal models promising healthy kidneys magnesium supplementation safe generally well tolerated point many formulations quite inexpensive yet woeful lack well designed decent sized randomized controlled trials various psychiatric disorders magnesium supplementation let look mechanisms first magnesium hangs synapse two neurons along calcium glutamate recall calcium glutamate excitatory excess toxic activate nmda receptor magnesium sit nmda receptor without activating like guard gate therefore deficient magnesium guard calcium glutamate activate receptor like tomorrow long term damages neurons eventually leading cell death brain easy situation reverse remedy stress diathesis model depression idea chronic stress leads hormonal imbalances excess cortisol eventually damages hippocampus brain leading impaired negative feedback thus ongoing stress depression neurotoxicity badness murck shows magnesium seems many levels hormonal axis regulation stress response magnesium suppress ability hippocampus stimulate ultimate release stress hormone reduce release acth hormone tells adrenal glands get gear pump cortisol adrenaline reduce responsiveness adrenal glands acth addition magnesium blood brain barrier prevent entrance stress hormones brain magnesium original chill pill links enough pique interest depression associated systemic inflammation cell mediated immune response turns magnesium deficiency addition animal models show sufficient magnesium seems protect brain depression anxiety traumatic brain injury antidepressants desipramine st john wort hypericum perforatum seem protect mice toxic effects magnesium deficiency relationship anxious depressed behaviors tricky things magnesium though first overall levels hard measure body magnesium stored bones rest cells small amount roaming free blood excellent review evmed forum one would speculate various mechanisms would allow recover needed magnesium intracellular space bones plenty hand probably serum levels may nearly useless telling full body magnesium availability studies levels depression schizophrenia pms anxiety place observational evidence mg ca ratio may better clue secondly best sources magnesium normal western diet whole grains minus phytates beans leafy green veggies nuts happen sources folate folate depletion linked depression may confounding factor epidemiological studies finally magnesium sequestered wasted times stress i speculating hunter gatherer immediate stress sort situation maybe needed neurons fire cylinders stress hormones rock roll body order survive presumably survived stress removed magnesium came hiding however may overall magnesium deficiency causing depression exaggerated stress response may chronic stress magnesium deficiency biomarker chronic stress hurt replete one magnesium face modern world least relationships studied thoroughly depression hugely expensive debilitating could alleviate burden enough mineral water know whether reasonable proposition i mentioned controlled trials magnesium supplementation psychiatric disorders couple covered premenstrual dysphoria cravings symptoms another small study showed improvement magnesium supplementation chronic fatigue syndrome two open label studies showed benefit mania another paper postulates magnesium deficiency could exacerbate bad symptoms schizophrenia nothing definitive course ridiculous many gazillions dollars spent drug research depression bipolar disorder schizophrenia possibly cheap plausible helpful natural remedy properly studied well evmed forum post i linked shows different bio availability various magnesium supplements easiest cheapest find magnesium oxide bio available tests urinary excretion show top magnesium month mg daily oxide also find effervescent magnesium oxide tablets seem bio available organic amino acid chelates i google search though find magnesium oxide effervescent sources amino acid chelates magnesium citrate seems inexpensive easy find magnesium taurinate advantage supplying taurine magnesium one formulation different blood pressure medicines psychiatric medications heartburn medicines medical conditions affect absorption metabolism magnesium short bowels typically due surgery removes large section bowel may want supplement magnesium oil formulation also going cause diarrhea oral supplements cause though i would say constipation common western world making magnesium safe cheap easy cure evmed forum review also mentions addition kidney disease people myasthenia gravis bowel obstruction bradycardia avoid supplementation addition diarrhea magnesium cause sedation broken small amounts throughout day taken night also taken transporter calcium zinc fight absorption jaminet jaminet recommend total daily levels mg people safely supplement mg daily without problems proceed without doctor supervision known kidney disease elderly take extra expensive highly bio available form eventually pee excess long kidneys going strong i magnesium oxide supplement i looked grabbed available target next time around i might try citrate though oxide cheap mentioned even oxide eventually results increased urinary excretion magnesium suggesting full body repletion people looking good paleo food sources go phew weeks since i linked song crystallized xx acoustic version
