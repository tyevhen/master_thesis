i missed labor day message last year reason i must burned burnout big theme physician community last several years almost like new discovery another new epidemic detailed comparisons degree burnout medical specialty even country country comparisons curious phenomenon burnout physicians blamed typical intervention course handle burnout know mindfulness meditation yoga time management never focus fact physicians work hard work free many people managed care companies pharmaceutical benefit managers government bureaucrats various levels employers come expect american physicians nothing better devote time energy betterment collective businesses metric physicians exploited employees usa group expected work many businesses free get me wrong i saying physicians paid well i saying according studies i read paid anywhere time work even time paid deeply discounted group professionals usa expected work arbitrary productivity scale varies greatly payer payer superimposed global budget federal incentives penalties superimposed top physicians work environment physicians expected teach future medical professionals free another one cases term professionalism marched used example pick course medical students residents take much time i know like teach want teach next several weekends whether call seeing patients devoted coming powerpoints lectures seminars medicine days happen without ritualistic exchange powerpoints process powerpoints get blamed i actually like powerpoints done correctly i think unfairly blamed burden suddenly produce displaced onto medium rather process focus missive today burnout root cause excessive uncompensated work one sources uncompensated work electronic health record ehr attitude toward ehr shifted direction i promoted decade group i working presented ehr trained i knew problem start moving hospital wide system basically entry medication orders health unit coordinators vital signs labs nursing notes progress notes dictated hand entered end day i printed mar record medications given patients double checked medications getting mar single page table showing medications left margin day columns right times administration dot matrix printing stylish modern printouts back time politicians overhyping ehr would save health care system hundreds billions dollars i little experiment one new hospital admissions i decided read outpatient medical notes see many significant medical diagnoses carried ehr time online new system years took me hours find read notes internal medicine endocrinology cardiology notes end i noticed significant diagnoses dropped somewhere along line nobody ever seems want acknowledge complexity medicine people get older accumulate incredible number medical problems cases indication long list medications taking seeing equally long list physicians truncating list diagnoses time constraints ehr eventually end looking short list need reproduce comprehensive evaluation scratch much time savings ehr even politicians quiet one new ehr experiment happened me recently i still treat medically complex patients often receive acute care hospitals may intensive care units since many taking various psychiatric medications i felt obligated see intensivists cardiologists pulmonologists gastroenterologists say medications whether complicated critical care ongoing care chronic medical problems i want see results ecgs labs imaging studies i want know patient received usual medications icu general hospital ehr information contained readable pages consisting admission note discharge summary mar couple sheets including actual ecg tracing lab reports event question i read ehr printout pages long contained limited data blood pressure trends readings printed even though one critical parameters followed physician notes jumbled paragraphs considerably less traditional reports bulk notes consisted checklists imported data different fonts margins appearance chaotic uses point courier font documents days i seen since days telegraph entire page document lines cardiologist note made sense i locked onto report i less optimistic phase two i working current position years time i requested mars hospitalized patients times i received exactly zero case reason went i received page fax mar patient critically ill delirious one point five different infusions used intensive care spread across many pages composition solutions listed specific rates infusion i wanted know exact amounts patient received me figure two critical factors mar evident ehr printout first patient much critically ill described ehr printout second none maintenance psychiatric medications given total time figure minutes addition read ehr printout interview total time evaluation report hours impossible physicians good job patient care without material i reviewed case hand places usa physician hours new evaluation end truncated problem lists partial medical care physicians staying clinic hours everyone else left without data enough information physician decent informed consent based discussion patient new set risks associated critical illness real culprit fact physicians lost control profession overhyped inefficient
