school thought says viruses originated escaped constellations host genes virus genes originate somewhere one theory started host genes trouble precious little evidence viral genes originated host genes plenty evidence contrary may actually host genes came viruses say viral genes derive host genes like saying hemorrhoids derive earlobes resemblance best superficial previous post i showed data relatively large phylogenetic distance thymidine kinase genes phages viruses attack bacteria hosts one case i showed prophage genes genes viruses succeeded integrating host dna similar host genes lytic lifestyle phages even case temperate phages i think honest say prophage still example foreign dna integrating host prophage genes usually easily identified base composition differs noticeably base composition host genes prophage becomes fully integrated host dna influence host repairosome tend ameliorate taking base composition characteristics host dna making superficially similar host dna characteristics ameliorated dna take consider codon usage patterns recall genetic code set way amino acids correspond one codon three letter pattern dna leucine example encoded six different ways namely base patterns cta ctg ctt ctc tta ttg likewise alanine encoded four ways gca gcg gct gcc specific organisms develop specific patterns codon use preferring certain synonyms others example clostridium botulinum food poisoning bug overwhelmingly prefers use tta leucine rarely using synonyms whereas coli strongly prefers use ctg choosing four one next used leucine codon codon preference patterns highly specific given species thought related numbers types available transfer rnas trna cell although frankly still open question whether codon usage adapted trna availability reverse idea viruses mutate rapidly evolve close harmony hosts reproduction depends suggests virus codon preferences match host would particularly true virus genes come host genes remember virus ribosomal machinery must rely host protein making equipment order survive therefore would make sense virus adapt codon usage patterns patterns favored host equipment find look codon usage patterns phage classic enterobacterial phage versus coli codon usage find differ substantially codon usage frequencies phage left coli right graphic host cell codon usage frequencies right corresponding virus frequencies left note chromosome encodes protein genes encompassing codons graphic based fairly solid numbers variations coli ca accounted simply statistical noise codon preferences different host cell phage brings genes types trna differences codon usage go well beyond codons presence trna genes dna explain divergence data temperate phages like fels prophage salmonella genome since prophage genes effect permanent part host genome would expect see amelioration codon usage fact see codon usage fels phage left salmonella typhimurium right see codon usage patterns fels host quite similar differences easily accounted fact fels protein coding genes amino acid composition genes probably different enough average host genes sway usage stats degree shown nevertheless codon usage patterns sufficient tell fels genes came originally still open question like martians war worlds fels genes probably came somewhere else robbie mean like europe tom cruise character robbie like europe
