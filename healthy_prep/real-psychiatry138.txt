hhr supports belief supply psychiatrists likely limits patient access services referring median numbers abstract use correct term actual number psychiatrists real numbers seem dramatic context statistics authors offer inconsistent analysis frequently equating number psychiatrists access services imposing severe limitations treatment illustrated statement since current supply psychiatrists meeting needs people mental illnesses keeping pace population growth policy makers medical community must consider ways address shortage improve access mental health care conclusion quite stretch
