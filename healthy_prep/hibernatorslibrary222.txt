chapter butcher abnormal psychology much information me adequately summarize one post therefore i break posts please bear me chapters far chapter longest least interesting me unfortunate also chapter highest distribution points upcoming exam main purpose chapter review three contemporary viewpoints treating mental illness biological psychological social post review biological causes mental illness biological viewpoint four commonly accepted causal factors mental illness neurotransmitter hormonal abnormalities genetic vulnerabilities temperament brain dysfunction neural plasticity reason scientists believe neurotransmitter imbalances lead mental illness success serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris similar drugs alleviating symptoms serotonin molecule released neurons send signals neurons neurons serotonin receptors stimulate neuronal response also serotonin reuptake molecules bind serotonin remove system ssri inhibits reuptake serotonin thus increasing length time serotonin present able bind serotonin receptor according book sometimes psychological stress lead neurotransmitter imbalances could excessive production release neurotransmitter dysfunction reuptake enzymatic breakdown neurotransmitter problems neurotransmitter receptors may overly sensitive professor suggested last week lecture think theory chemical imbalance necessarily plausible ssri decreases symptoms mean symptoms caused abnormally low levels serotonin anymore fact aspirin decreases certain symptoms means symptoms caused abnormally low levels aspirin professor even said chemical imbalance theory well founded ancient greek humor imbalance theory discussed summary chapter i admit i familiar neurotransmitter research i ca say whether professor reservations well founded certainly made me think critically subject hormonal imbalances cause mental illness example hypothyroidism leading depression causes fatigue slows body textbook focuses hypothalamic pituitary adrenal hpa axis focus seems hpa axis release stress hormone cortisol genetic effect mental illness seems fairly straight forward first glance mental illnesses heritable heritability genes activated right stressors cause mental illness someone gene preinclination mental illness necessarily develop symptoms makes genetic effects complicated genes interact environment instance person gene depression might also depressive parents create environment less nurturing functional thus providing stressors may lead depression child considered passive effect hand child genotype may actively affect environment example sulky child may trouble making friends thus changing environment one increases likelihood depression also evocative effect parents may react negatively sulky babies leading less healthy relationship likelihood depression i admit i difficulty distinguishing active effect evocative effect unless simply whether child temperament affects parent behavior psychologists study genetic factor mental illness using three models pedigree analysis twin studies adoption studies pedigree analysis psychologist determine strength heritability within family comparing incidence within family versus incidence within community large problem method families share genes also environments thus two methods used tease environmental factors genetic factors looking concordance rate identical twins percentage twins share disorder compared concordance rate siblings fraternal twins could indicate big role genetics plays another method tease environmental factors genetic factors studying siblings better yet identical twins adopted different families thus different environments identical twins adopted different families high concordance rate mental illness likely genetic effect strong environment often forgotten womb pregnancy child mother undergoing intense stress pregnancy may inclination respond strongly stressful situations stress pregnancy could cause epigenetic changes genes change changes chromosomes binding certain molecules change expression particular gene set genes series posts summarizing i learning abnormal psychology course much information provided comes reading
