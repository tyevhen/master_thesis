interesting study july jama psychiatry treatment first episode psychosis fep authors conclude first study shows major advantages antipsychotic discontinuation strategy maintenance therapy fep always topic interest me years i ran inpatient unit admission patients fep purposes study fep encompassed diagnoses schizophrenia schizophreniform disorder schizoaffective disorder brief reactive psychosis delusional disorder psychotic disorder otherwise specified nos diagnoses mood disorders organic disorder psychotic symptoms thirty six percent comorbid alcohol substance use disorder original study years earlier patients randomized dr dose reduction discontinuation mtmaintenance treatment arms things striking i look study first relatively small patient study diagnostic heterogeneity subgroup analysis years figure total patients subgroups diagnostic categories imply chronicity others experimental standpoint i concerns addition last three categories delusional disorder brief psychotic disorder psychotic disorder nos experience delusional disorder often associated much functional impairment patients often benefit want take medications engaged psychotherapy maintaining therapy often problematic unless associated crisis lives brief psychotic disorders also good prognosis i recall presenting data families concerned problem based review primarily scandinavian literature suggesting patients diagnosis brief reactive psychosis experienced remissions schizoaffective disorder similar problems manic subtype course prognosis similar bipolar disorder depressive subtype course prognosis similar schizophrenia clinical practice extremely common see bipolar patients misdiagnosed schizoaffective disorder i always wondered impacts studies course prognosis rate adding diagnostic categories total sample biases study toward better outcomes dose haloperidol interesting i started practice inpatient psychiatry era high dose antipsychotic medication take long figure bad idea also take long look basic science behind antipsychotic medication dosing key figure early days dopamine receptor pharmacology phillip seeman phd wrote excellent review american college neuropsychopharmacology fourth generation progress graph receptor dissociation constants versus free neuroleptic plasma water correlated well antipsychotic dose provided sound rationale lower doses also monitoring plasma levels antipsychotics experience people need higher doses antipsychotics rapid metabolizers particular drug lower expected levels haloperidol usually translates dose mg day consistent dose ranges diagram figure paper also distinct group people neurotoxicity antipsychotic medications probably never take also i member movement disorder society another interesting aspect paper psychopathology ratings i noticed diagnostic heterogeneity likelihood remission logical question ratings show study positive negative syndrome scale panss i experience brief versions scales dimension rated point likert scale normal extremely severe panss widely accepted psychometrically valid consensus interpretation scoring might mean remission study track back original description sample observe average baseline panss p

strikingly similar panns bprs cgi scores recently investigated leucht et al conclude change point reduction panss score equivalent mild clinical improvement reduction consistent much improvement acutely ill non refractory sample i think reasonable conclusions study mildly symptomatic populations fep may cautiously tapered low dose antipsychotics time experience better functional recovery tapering earlier course higher risk relapse treatment recommendation low dose antipsychotic medication mildly symptomatic populations sound practice according report another important aspect minimal side effects reported standard measures study still common find patients discharged hospitals equivalent mg haloperidol show first outpatient visit metabolic neurological side effects fep needs study i suppose wait large initiative i may missed one progress best approach time would large clinics hospital based programs develop fep clinics staffed interested staff networked share information study highlights following remission psychotic symptoms enough common practice following people outpatient medication management visit enough restore functional capacity quality life also question availability psychotherapy people successfully taper antipsychotic medications i found psychotherapy often useful treatment people tolerate low dose antipsychotic medication authors describe reasonable concerns study including fact may selected best half subjects original trial subjects nonparticipants second study described functioning lower level less adherent therapy difficult engage difficult see rankings baseline also point raters blind suggest probably would account degree difference based studies clinics deal well certain chronic disease like cystic fibrosis motivated clinicians stake treatment method outcome clearly make difference might reflected ratings discuss mechanism account gains functional capacity dr arm basically less impairment dopamine signaling possible impairment drive motivation functional capacity recommend follow studies years longer duration look trends finally really reason principles discovered fep study psychotherapy study psychosis applied patients histories recurrent psychotic episodes highly motivated clinicians apply treatment modalities opportunity really different large scale much better funded efforts specialties treatments outcomes state flux good example would electrophysiological ablation atrial fibrillation opinion implications study idea life long maintenance therapy equally damning model seeing patients
