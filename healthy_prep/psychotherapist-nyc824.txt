clients come therapy focused almost exclusively changing someone else often neglect neglect become immersed trying get person change convinced odds something get loved ones change role denial years ago i friend day wife died alcohol related complications convinced could get stop drinking denial despite evidence contrary including severe liver damage cognitive impairment non stop drinking could deterred efforts get abstinent alcohol died even though watched steady decline close range person surprised death also shattered realize nothing made difference role inner child often adult child wants change parent inner child part wishing odds parent change clients often surprised hear even though might adults beyond still inner child parts still operating deep emotional level surprised discover inner child taken control emotions reasoning powerful effect feel think inner child might buried deep still often get emotionally triggered certain situations typically situations involve old desire still strong change someone loves person wanted change child could someone else example young boy strong desire stop alcoholic mother drinking unusual feelings gets married woman active alcoholic helping inner child update file inner children often fragile vulnerable emotionally want run roughshod however want help inner children realize course strong wish fantasy mother would stop drinking somehow would help stop perfectly understandable back typically therapist works clients come therapy primarily help loved one helps clients update file often involves trauma work work old trauma getting triggered new situation also grief work done old situation current situation road acceptance i guess probably going change client starting come grips fact loved one probably going change often say almost questioning tone i guess probably going change big step client recovery might tentative step might involve taking one step forward another step backwards denial sets beginning opening adult self nurture inner child focusing rather continuing neglect focusing much changing person clients coming grips reality situation ideally begin focus maybe neglected health maybe
