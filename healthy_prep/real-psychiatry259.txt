one latest non scandals rock monolithic psychiatry psychiatrists everywhere david healy commentary serotonin depression certainly nothing new healian perspective ssris work ssris work melancholic depression evidence ssris raise lower serotonin levels ssris pushed tricyclic antidepressants market ssris forced abandonment research biological disturbances depression like hypercortisolemia thing i see idea ssris somehow addicting cause discontinuation symptoms subgroup people take feel free call withdrawal syndrome withdrawal constitute addiction premises allow reject serotonin role depression vaguest possible grounds stating irrelevant serotonin irrelevant noradrenaline dopamine neurotransmitters expect correlation personality temperament indeed i expect weak correlations probably par mood disorder work i glad see reference late marrku linnoila specifically linnoila virkkunen linnoila done outstanding work area work serotonin metabolites csf hiaa alcohol use disorders remains classic talks serotonin based research running sand i medline search serotonin major depression plotted papers per year seem precipitous fall references march anything i would expect research increase availability ligands additional receptors characterization serotonin transporter sert variants main problem healy argument talking serotonin chemical floating around brain basically describing brand chemical imbalance theory saying serotonin chemical imbalance theory i would course wholeheartedly agree fact i would tell thing i told prozac rep back brain far bag chemicals unless say something brain structure physiology naming neurotransmitter meaningless thing chemical imbalance theory reading index psychopharmacology text printed past years confirm healy ca stop level goes describe impact chemical imbalance theory clinicians history raises questions weight doctors others put biological epidemiological plausibility plausible mythical account biology treatment let everyone put aside clinical trial data show evidence lives saved restored function things get tenuous point clinician made career treating patients severe problems i care biological epidemiological plausibility theory medication i got past elegant nobel laureate mechanism action aminophylline debunked former first line drug asthma copd exacerbations suddenly relegated tertiary status even people i running gurneys emergency department calculating parameters aminophylline drip patient mine lost i suppose could say elaborate placebo response treating people acute shortness breath bad enough brought paramedics i using tertiary treatment disproven molecular mechanism really living breathing pulmonary patients seem mind thing matters me medication works hands side effects i using exclusively save lives restore functioning without keeping anyone suspense i prescribe ssris work i fully acknowledge anyone willing listen mechanism action unknown surprisingly many patients want i discuss speculative mechanisms well next psychiatrist i think makes me drug company stooge idiot i person accountability entire scheme things really matter me david healy anybody else thinks i seeing ill people job get better cause side effects medication drug interact one underlying medical conditions get right i need mechanism action use medication approval regulatory body like fda point somebody may say ssris better depression aminophylline asthma far apart healy various sympathizers happened i attended cme conference last weekend still recommended far i know fda sent letter doctors telling prescribe healy also asks irrelevant question clinical trial data marketed evidence effectiveness make easier adopt mythical account biology i guess real question data make easier accept strawman i strongly encourage psychiatrist read reread fda approved package insert drug prescribe drug patient happens taking i encourage reading rereading package inserts especially updated sent mass mailing fda package inserts need studied final word safe prescribing experienced psychiatrist routinely called decide medication based available evidence safe prescribe patient cardiac liver renal disease minimal data go cases people significant medical illness typically eliminated clinical trials psychiatrist reading package inserts recognize time package inserts contained clinical trials data data useful utility nothing putative biological mechanisms safely monitoring prescribing medication consideration implicit question clinical psychiatrists unaware clinical trials really primitive technology given awareness exists would anyone accept clinical trials data proof much anything world double blind placebo controlled study intent treat analysis anything practice psychiatry totally irrelevant clinically even less relevant theoretically use get new drug hands patients i accept useful reject toxic worthless reasonable people interested serotonin despite healy commentary complexity serotonin appropriately serotonergic signaling one absolute levels neurotransmitters rarely issue complex disorders case serotonin bare bones discussion needs consider fact serotonin ht receptor subtypes coded genes receptors organized families protein receptor linked superfamily remaining family part ligand gated ion channel superfamily combinatorics receptor types specific locations genetic variants lead dizzying number signaling variations easily found psychiatric research example review serotonin signaling depression suicide mann part neurobiology observed recurrent major depression present episodes

odds ratio convergent evidence comes reports low csf hiaa suicide attempters diagnoses schizophrenia bipolar disorder personality disorders although fewer studies less consensus disorders nevertheless correct findings suggest less serotonin transmission implied less hiaa appears associated suicidal behaviour across psychiatric diagnostic boundaries would expected associated diathesis suicidal behaviour instead specific psychiatric disorder review post mortem brain studies suicides found much thing studies find suicides lower levels serotonin hiaa brainstem serotonin neurons compared psychiatric matched groups apart disputed technical details importance healy commentary follows political tradition commentaries mentioned blog prominent psychiatrists people sent me mails asked me mean political simplest analysis taking one end polarized position running bringing everything support position classic way politicians work fueled ideology surface seems science operates like well ongoing scientific arguments include comments marketing words like neurobabble make assumptions clinicians think whether confusing science hypthothesis testing clinical work best science encompasses complexity contradictory data past point neuroscience watered masses minute sound bite neurobabble happens neuroscience discussion reduced sound bite debated way democrats republicans discuss anything happens polled serotonin yes really want get opinion press way one thing let pretend psychiatrists really think way psychiatrists flunkies big pharma talking crazy chemical imbalance theory based
