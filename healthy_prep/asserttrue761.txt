night i looking jsr swing application framework prototype implementation according landing page small set java classes simplify building desktop applications made me smile statement landing page intended audience snapshot experienced swing developers moderately high tolerance pain i tweeted gil hova tweeted back wait swing developers low tolerances pain i laughed hard i almost blew coffee nose taking java seriously going i tell swing application framework appears dead jsr marked inactive recent build carrying date october supposed go java se seems kind limbo case wondering exactly swing app framework designed let hello world example cited creators public class applicationexample extends application jframe mainframe null override protected void startupstring ignoreargs jlabel label new jlabel hello world jlabel center label setfontnew font lucidasans font plain mainframe new jframe hello world mainframe addlabel borderlayout center mainframe addwindowlistenernew mainframelistener mainframe setdefaultcloseoperationjframe nothing close mainframe pack mainframe setlocationrelativetonull center window mainframe setvisibletrue private class mainframelistener extends windowadapter public void windowclosingwindowevent exite public static void mainstring args launchapplicationexample class args i sure lot goodness packed away somewhere bowels saf api sure showing hello world code run foregoing code get yes ugly large type edition browser javascript window alert except takes lines code instead one snippet illustrates scant handful many annoyances make swing programming feel much like death thousand paper cuts example shows repetitive boilerplate code swing programmers forced write every time something common jframe needed setlocationrelativetonull setvisibletrue ever ridiculous pack needless mumbo jumbo get rid roll view make default behaviors i want override things let me nine times ten i create jframe i fact want centered onscreen i want visible i want go away dismissed garbage collected i want recite pack ever lifetime library makes programmers write boilerplate lame violates basic principle good api design code hidden programmer hidden see slide joshua bloch excellent slideshow giving things reasonable default values likewise sin something else rubs me wrong way creating new api framework case supplement existing api seems me use opportunity introduce additional language syntax words introduce annotations underlying api use keep simple streamline simplify enough ranting balance i think swing app framework good idea adds value i think something like go java se although make writing jframe code less annoying provide host application services would otherwise require swing programmers write tons tons really tedious code anything reduces tonnage good i say
