i go bed sometimes wondering early earth like i try imagine possible life could arisen planet perhaps current age barely cool enough oceans boil generally understood life originated around billion years ago tide pools swamps lakes possibly deep ocean organic molecules rained lightning filled skies heavy pyroclastic gases called primordial soup theory haldane oparin given experimental weight miller urey leaves open rather lot important details clearly implies biopoiesis arose aqueous phase interaction co solutes life begin near hydrothermal vents researchers believe serpentinite rock structures associated white chimneys could provided ph gradients suitable biopoesis chemical standpoint characteristic defining feature life catalysis particular catalytic formation catalysts catalyze formation standard crick dogma dna rna protein leave undrawn many monomer protein interactions lead back dna nevertheless clear proteins rna molecules play mainly catalytic roles cell chemistry precisely reason aqueous phase soup theory probably reconsidered chemist tell surface catalysis phase boundary catalysis orders magnitude effective pure liquid phase catalysis catalytic converters cars giant bongs fluid instead contain ceramic honeycomb core overlaid solid phase platinum palladium washcoat also largest industrial catalytic operations including fluid catalytic cracking petroleum oil fluid terms flow ingredients catalyst solid powder employ surface catalysis indeed catalysts often used powdered sintered coated bead form specifically maximize surface area living cells enzymes partially solvated interior portions typically hygrophobic enzymes fact imagined solid fixtures onto reactants adsorbed surely one thinks ribosomes solution way say sodium ion solution surface catalysis characterizes living systems well industrial processes also know crowding effects important controlling enzyme shape activity absence crowding enzymes tend partially unfold indeed seems likely molecular confinement extent driven evolution protein primary tertiary structure would argue biological macromolecules resembling today could reasonably arisen confine free aqueous phase therefore proto biotic soup envisioned oparinn haldane unlikely produced cellular life say much likely biopoiesis began environment solvated clay particles serpentine rock near hydrothermal vents perhaps feldspar lattice kind colloid clay offers many advantages clay clay particles must larger average microns perfect substrate size growth loosely bound biological macromolecules particles offer huge amount surface area per unit volume much could realized say attachment catalytic foci sheets silica laden rock state ignorance biopoiesis still clear agreement whether proteins appeared first nucleic acids perhaps biologically active lipids jury still called rna world theory gained tremendous following last years based part work cech altman showing rna capable catalyzing protein formation fundamental unanswered problem rna world theory pyrimidines purines monomers managed link sugars form first rna molecules absence suitable catalyst rna catalyze formation rna first rna like oligomer arise without catalyst pyrimidines purines known spontaneously bind ribose much less form phosphorylated nucleotides contrast amino acids easily condense form dipeptides dipeptides catlyze formation peptides example dipeptide histidyl histidine shown catalyze formation polyglycine wet dry cycled clay thus least plausible proteins came first ironically abiotic formation purines pyrimidines insurmountable problem provided accept hydrogen cyanide formaldehyde present primordial soup hcn formaldehyde produced good yields spark discharge experiments involving diatomic nitrogen co water hydrogen even absence molecular hydrogen yield hcn hco approach hcn undergoes base catalyzed tetramerization reaction produce diaminomaleonitrile damn aid v light go yield variety purines acid hydrolysis hcn oligomers thus produced lead somewhat circuitously pyrimidines abiotic formation sugars also possible formaldehyde present condensation formaldehyde presence calcium carbonate alumina yields glycoaldehyde begin cascade aldol condensations enolizations produce formidable array trioses tetroses pentoses higher sugars via butlerow chemistry also called formose reaction greatest problem rna world theory thus ab initio creation bases sugars rather attachment one another current biologic systems pyrimidines attached sugars displacement pyrophosphate sugar position something succeeded lab prebiotic conditions living systems purine nucleosides created piecing together purine base preexisting ribose phosphate hard see could occur abiotically worth noting spontaneous creation sugars bases occur condensations reactions result would simply riboses purines pyrimidines seen today rather would arise zoo different products including stereoisomers products among pentoses alone twelve different possible stereoisomers somehow early systems would converged sugars bases isomers needed promulgate living systems abundance isomers bad thing maybe pre cellular miasmal life actually comprised remarkable zoo thousands hundreds thousands potential biomolecular precursors catalytogenic survived muds clays offered particle substrates molecules formed one imagine sticky molecules power adhere tenciously clay particles sealing competing molecules would eventually control means catalysis would meant micron sized clay particles covered would today called nonsense proteins ad hoc polypeptides made whatever amino acids reactive species might easily polymerize might nonsense proteins capable shakespeare monkey typing pool world kind protein possible subject steric hindrance crowding effects laws chemistry seems likely one micron clay particle coated shakespeare monkey proteins would expose accident hundreds thousands active sites various kinds creating catalytic opportunities exactly sort needed take chemical evolution next stage enterprising st century urey miller needs affix tens hundreds thousands nonsense proteins hundreds thousands better millions clay particles soak monomers various kinds amino acids sugars bases lipids see comes experiments need done activated colloids various kinds using temperature cycling energy source using using oxidizing reducing agents without wet dry cycling without freezing thawing electrical energy etc need focus efforts came rna world life like templates genetic code crick dogma proteins like invention start codon stop codon protein size determined brownian dynamics reactant exhaustion molecular crowding intervention chaperones proteases kinds protein worlds might existed acidic conditions basic
