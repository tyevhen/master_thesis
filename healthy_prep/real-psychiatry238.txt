specialized approach case authors found two loci chromosome contributed risk mdd replicated findings independent sample one features i liked paper focus patients severe depression i lost count number papers i read depression rating scores i consider low trivial many rating systems used clinics seem use systems determining gets antidepressant whenever i see i always reminded biological psychiatry versus psychotherapy debates existed i training favorite authors time julien mendlewicz anything would publish journal clinical endocrinology metabolism table one studies ham scores patients unipolar depression seeing ranged mean bipolar patients study range mean one patients could rated initially severe psychomotor retardation levels depression typically seen depression research either standpoint basic science probably never psychopharmacological research much research i aware allows recruitment patients ham scores high teens low i think best way run experiments biologically based depressions antidepressant medications rarely commentary consort group paper finally comments factor useful experimental approach even though mendlewicz using second issue crops paper replication authors validate
