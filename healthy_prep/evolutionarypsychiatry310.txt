i mentioned last post first biosphere closure experiment rough going considering circumstances starvation suffocation split factions poor management i find incredible eight humans sealed inside finished two years biospherian jane poynter reports overarching issue divided crew four four respect science versus respect project two year closure goal honest put far politely i ever could last post much information book human experiment two years twenty minutes inside biosphere problems began biosphere notably lack food disappearing oxygen management tended want keep issues secret public addition management position biospherians make work matter lead extreme decisions team doctor also oldest crew member several decades began periods incoherence collapse low oxygen levels informed management felt would able attend another crew member need originally told oxygen would piped suspected crew could survive two days immediate medical emergency interesting side note biospherians experience typical low oxygen adaptation despite extremely gradual drop levels many months normally go higher altitude within days weeks bodies adapt making red blood cells capable carrying oxygen blood biospherians make red blood cells probably malnourished instead hemoglobin changed shape slightly could carry oxygen lower oxygen pressures perhaps i doctor maybe i watched many episodes star trek i read refusal management pump oxygen request team doctor i amazed i might said something unladylike rigid dedication management nothing threatened safety crew entire experiment frankly long keep goes necessary minimum keep track tons gas calories food really matter scientifically shakedown cruise biosphere needed little help outside eventually reason prevailed oxygen pumped split crew already firm barrier i consider sensible side wanted share news public get finest scientific minds working problems closure bust side seemed exist unscientific philosophical logjam rigidly defined successful mission possibility everyone damned happened involves little history science psychology see science bit hierarchy hard sciences chemistry physics seen tangible real soft sciences ecology even evolutionary biology biosphere big crazy ecology experiment control run non scientists management leaders synergist movement literally traveling adventurers weekly meditation philosophy meetings theatre troupes charismatic head synergists leader biosphere project john allen i ca make diagnosis man never met i say charismatic leaders international groups demand weekly meetings leader gives lectures increasingly angry pointless rants jane describes tend narcissistic side one prominent feature narcissism splitting picking people best friend people scapegoats shamed kicked group better went middle school one side jane book john allen reaction reality biosphere agriculture would support crew needs fire crew chief two others including jane poynter weeks prior beginning first closure experiment jane another crew member reinstated john rage passed i giving one example many suffice say one managing isolated group people splitting factions norm according mir antarctic mission histories management actively promotes fear splitting denies biospherians free counseling funded arranged experiment super bad idea things became dire towards end chairman psychiatry university arizona called interview everyone make sure one lost touch reality one biospherians resilient folk let sealed unproven ecological chamber whim charismatic group leader i writing blog i writing blog evolutionary medicine biosphere bodies hugely complex ecosystem control evolutionary paradigm many variables properly studied hard science sort way another key vulnerability narcissism predisposition insecurity cardiologists near top medical hierarchy ekgs interventional medicine pacemakers lipitor get paid lot use electricity hard science psychiatrists near bottom medical hierarchy procedures shock therapy popular one transcranial magnetic stimulation may use electricity science psychology exceedingly soft many people describe actually contrast dr kelly cardiologist looked ekg blood tests told me take lipitor told me eat margarine plant sterols dr deans psychiatrist asked me lot really nosy questions told me eat pasture butter became nearly incoherent rage subject plant sterol margarine came reason insecure makes me hopeful future evolutionary medicine apparent absence guru seem okay making theoretical mistakes wrong time time let insecurity unknowns force positions return rely science must science based nominal biological plausibility arrogance rigidity destroy soft science eventually destroyed sealed experiments biosphere second closure experiment ended prematurely federal marshals called evict management behest investors columbia university took management biosphere followed university arizona one first things allow flow air divide key ecosystems careful controlled study smaller experiments useful important forget big picture think study question authority important lessons biosphere
