best way start post taking look graphic graphic year old man diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea using continuous positive airway pressure cpap machine cpap creates airsplint airway prevent airway collapse snoring importantly hypoxemia due obstruction bottom graph downloaded cpap machine shows number apneic hypopneic episodes shown graph around october patient got upper respiratory infection nasal congestion worsened changed cpap mask nasal cpap full face mask number air leaks mask found later experienced nightly air leaks air leakage enough wake wife sleeping bed hypopneic episodes worsened started wake palpitations morning orange timeline shows patient developed atrial fibrillation minutes minutes point went see pulmonologist ahi index downloaded sleep central part psychiatric evaluation many colleagues residents gone sleep medicine fellowships i think logical career path psychiatrist general psychiatrists need know quite lot sleep assess treat sleep problems assessments obstructive sleep apnea osa common problem standard series questions evaluation i consistently impressed number people already diagnosed osa polysomnography prescribed continuous positive airway pressure cpap devices either use gave trying use number misconceptions osa cpap i thought i might address post osa benign condition best way start discussion look complex graphic association osa cpap atrial fibrillation known comorbidity osa case year old man known diagnosis osa cpap years osa diagnosis episode paroxysmal atrial fibrillation exercising starting cpap asymptomatic years getting upper respiratory infection changing mask using cpap machine first papers osa cardiovascular risk began appearing since research demonstrated cardiovascular endocrine cognitive comorbidity recent research suggests severe mild moderate osa increases risk cause mortality case patient patients atrial fibrillation obstructive sleep apnea addition clear disease states osa puts people increased risk motor vehicle accidents occupational hazards cognitive symptoms excessive daytime somnolence cpap elective intervention i always shocked number men view sleep study use cpap elective procedures i doubt lack adequate explanation problem implications issue especially diagnosis made sleep lab assessments i often discussing chronic fatigue insomnia hypersomnolence cognitive problems depression attentional problems anxiety prominent features disorder wish part patient i give pill solve problems time early days osa specific tricyclic antidepressant thought treat useful treating disorder disproven early often treated sedative hypnotic anxiolytic drugs purpose cases also taking opioid medications muscle relaxants opioids demonstrated dose dependent respiratory ataxia medications decrease respiratory drive either prolong apneic episodes directly interfere respiratory mechanisms alcohol use another complicating factor either combination medications adversely affect osa normal respiration i lost weight i probably need use cpap although high body weight general feature modern american society medications prescribed psychiatric disorders lead significant weight gain metabolic effects many patients undergo profound weight changes directions common see patients osa significant weight loss decided stop using cpap basis reconsulted sleep medicine repeat polysomnography placing much value correlation bmi sleep apnea losing weight result resolution osa also possible osa without obesity suggesting minimum sleep medicine reconsulted issue discontinuing cpap complex relationship obesity osa highlighted recent review authors point obesity weight loss sustained weight loss difficult problems three controlled trials weight loss intervention improvements ahi weight loss worsening ahi weight regained also looked extreme weight loss bariatric surgery concluded drop bmi unit associated unit improvement ahi authors compile table earlier studies look weight losses accompanying improvement ahi unfortunately studies ahi measured subjects studies subjects post op bmi conclude majority bariatric surgery candidates remain overweight surgery many still moderate osa need cpap overall thesis osa complex disorder therefore single intervention like weight loss alone used i snoring much i need use cpap snoring caused vibration upper airway tissues involved obstruction snoring caused number acute chronic conditions well artifact normal genetically determined anatomy men women snore sleep apnea many people snoring positional occurs much often supine side sleeping position snoring also depends detection snoring apneic spells directly observed sleep partner diagnostic self report waking gasping snoring although reports also investigated snoring like body weight approximate correlate osa decision stop cpap made assistance sleep medicine physician modern cpap equipment provide significant amount home data assist decision considerations diagnosis osa prescription cpap person seeing me strongly encouraged whatever necessary use cpap machine reduce risk factors including unnecessary medication may affect respiration i may reluctant consider therapies directly impacting respiration may effect due synergies compounds like antidepressant trazodone combinations sleep also count hearing comorbid conditions like atrial fibrillation case clearly affected osa diagnosis cpap machine please use modern autotitrating machines much easier use allow direct patient access data possible download smartphone app get relevant sleep data directly
