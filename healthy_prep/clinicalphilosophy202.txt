last year i privilege working primary care setting working wide variety people wide variety problems people struggled bereavement losses others struggled managing sporadic anxiety panic others find hard manage relationships without frequent explosions anger others often experienced childhood sexual abuse turn physical means cutting pills medicines suicide attempts alcohol exercise much little food manage feelings experienced overwhelming intolerable others struggle motivate hold onto hope given wide variety problems perhaps surprising i found one clinical perspective theory model helps me understand going every one patients know times i thought accelerated psychodynamic perspective cbt approach narrative therapy model solution focused method mindfulness based approach person centred stance purely behavioural tack would trick sometimes happens i relevant training read latest book regarding particular model question thankfully clinical experience soon prevents development unhelpful manic theoretical omnipotence easy situation manage i want start exploring reasons one getting grips different 'instruments different theories imagine asked play violin orchestra also able pick oboe trombone moment easy techniques learnt habits really quite different embouchure may require different strengths weaknesses lips cheeks different cases situation therapy situation even complicated therapy situation especially less behavioural therapies instrument therapist self merely i must something different perhaps i must also something different working different people different problems course sense important thing i myself room patient fact therapeutic modalities simply come naturally nature however hard i practice always case i take much naturally violin tuba however small part answer original question say relation model patient problem merely matter 'horses courses seems radically underestimate conceptual complexity regarding 'good fit amounts already suggested partly therapist must know way embody theory question simply matter objective matching theory data living theory particular case look like depends part sensibilities therapist also i believe due status models simply presenting different hypotheses regarding origins distress also presenting quite different perspectives much already made different values embedded different therapies symptom relief characterological change etc i fussed prefer get values life make patient values drivers therapeutic process times multiplicity perspectives provided different therapeutic models seems me inspire quick retreat theoretical constructivist position theories different incommensurable ways making sense data experience counts seems theoretical perspectives work better also meaningfully said fit better certain kinds cases nevertheless also seems unrealistic me take possibility talking 'fitting indicative theories really best thought different hypotheses said relation theory 'data i come think i always struck way models seem bring alive understanding midst certain cases merely redescribe others way adds little smug sense continued professional expertise uni model practitioner already known concept repression brings alive phenomenology hysteria concept thwarted mourning works well certain cases depression cbt perspective anxiety disorders works rather well clients middle class generally well adjusted struggle episodes panic ideas developed midst attachment theory surprise seem day thinking cases health anxiety rogerian focus authentic listening provision recognition never goes amiss seems particularly apt working patients little accepted earlier life focus behavioural activation seems work wonders biologically depressed patients enough 'life time focus intrapsychic conflicts nicely trick others catharsis sometimes hugely pertinent often initial short lived therapeutic value offering thinking terms 'containment seems helpful frequently feel overwhelmed 'mentalisation cuts conceptual mustard many 'borderline cases simplify even might suggested different models conceptually organised around different core emotions cbtists driven 'anxiety kleinians motivated 'guilt counsellors preoccupied 'loss etc one patient always possible redescribe inner life difficulties terms complex inter relations experiences situated ramified lives one individual also remains true perspectives bring alive speak cases others cases ready spoken terms say loss readiness part phenomenology patient concepts start become tired fray applied outside zone maximal unconcealment therapists ear best poised hear narratives guilt loss locate life stories might otherwise feel feature sub plots best attentive readers notice i subtly distanced myself realist notions either truth apt representation idealist notions incommensurable conceptual schemes end set expressivist speak bring alive etc metaphors well fine me admittedly i like able say certain uses language resonate rather aptly represent conceptually organise intentional objects however wait another day
