i watch lot dumb movies regular readers already know i tolerate lot stupidity movies long keep attention minutes leave me general understanding i saw i pretty much good i forgive lot things i forgive apocalypto laughable misrepresentation history i forgive dracula untold portrayal one europe brutal rulers loving family man i forgive pirates caribbean slow descent plot hole riddled parody movies stupid forgive reading poster actually makes dumber lucy minute exercise sci fi disappointment wins pick dumbest movie entire st century thus far seen give one flying fuck spoilers movie young woman kidnapped drug lords pouch fetus based drugs sewn abdomen pouch ruptures get destination instead janis joplin ing way world lucy becomes first human able access brain power rapidly approaching shenanigans ensue morgan freeman present really need know movie mandatory viewing film schools reason teach future filmmakers base big budget motion picture fun fact read chain email grandmother forwarded director luc besson also director fifth element sci fi story genetically perfect orange headed woman wears nothing gauze bandages battles plastic headed gary oldman confused cross dressing radio broadcaster shrieks nonsense microphone compared lucy film looks like goddamn documentary think i harsh consider entire premise complete nonsense use brains movie poster says trailers say morgan freeman spends half movie standing podium front university lecture theatre front hundreds impressionable students saying know say anyone fucking clue brain works me every time someone says i previously mentioned blog going life using brains harboring untapped mysteries even make sense i told i going expose brain plunge knife completely random painless process i might add since pain receptors brain probably pretty upset me thing true would mean brain useless fleshy padding absolutely bearing day day functioning odds stabbing anything useful would ridiculous pervasive little 'fun fact truth sustaining massive brain damage stroke would big deal since damage would always useless 'extra brain using anyway nice still got way left wo even notice playing game blindfolded brain surgery roulette freak much probably realize location new brain stab wound would profound effect brand new disability walked away consider map brain yeah go ahead stab me cerebellum i bet thing much look everything brain seems sort vital function i see large blank spaces labelled fuck i know secrets time universe probably locked good reason neurons get used things die point keeping alive brain want let happen valuable chunks even large portion brain suddenly finds nothing like instance go blind take away visual cortex reason existing tissue get left rot another brain function move snatch neurons fact go blind brain decide looks like lovely spot new braille reading ability live fact movie tries gloss everything evolutionary explanations makes even ridiculous let talk evolution brain single biggest consumer energy entire body full one third metabolism dedicated keeping sucker running know anything process evolution know wasteful every feature develop somehow contribute survival reproductive success sprout random extra shit looks cool thing true would mean bodies whatever reason decided devote shitload time energy develop super brains arbitrarily locked still insisting dump tons valuable calories keeping hummer brains alive average person must eat calories per day maintain body weight means almost calories go directly powering brain never ever use providing benefit whatsoever one every day movie tries sidestep around ridiculous bit fake brain trivia claiming average human uses brain apparently concede maybe physical brain useless mystery meat could fire neurons unlock secrets universe well great news sci fi fans already people among right fire lot neurons know call someone fires neurons time fucking grand mal seizure good time brain actually relies differences neural firing rates send receive messages order accomplish tasks like reading text recognizing faces beating fucking heart brain looks neurons firing well ones obliterate messages blindly firing neurons time best possible outcome seize wildly kitchen floor muscles bodily processes go completely control worst possible outcome catastrophic organ failure followed death turns heart rate thing pretty important powers make biological sense lucy ability use brain increases starts gain access neat superhuman abilities brain allegedly hiding whole time i admit could somehow gain brain power absolutely would start notice capable things used notably things actually brain related processing speed memory learning time name little bit movie mostly see lucy obtaining men style mutant powers make absolutely sense first thing lucy gains hitting brain capacity ability control physical functions ignoring part movie wherein morgan freeman mentions dolphins control brains therefore apparently manually monitoring heart rates metabolisms presented good thing would want take manual control circulatory digestive lymph immune endocrine systems fucking nobody trust me got good thing going right idea many biological functions required keep alive given moment right sitting scrolling article body taking carbon dioxide oxygen nitrogen atmosphere circulating entire body make sure die feeding nutrients billions billions hungry cells make every part body repairing tissue damages time thought try parkour last week immune system fending dangerous pathogens picked rolling around truck stop floor digestive system producing mucus layer needs protect digesting inside unknown bacteria gut performing mysterious vital functions modern medicine even know yet brain keep things hidden trust takes care worry favour multitask even people iqs upper fringes multitask simply effective switching back forth single tasks first time lucy got stressed startled decided check stranger cute butt subway apt mix kidney pancreas functions lapse full fledged ketoacidosis middle learning chinese overnight even buy notion lucy new superbrain juggle thousands bodily functions without accidentally making shit spleen one problem remember lucy new brain lot things ca make chemical reactions move faster problem see body basic functions go brain would brain long way specialized cells various body systems know need brain babysit got shit cells perform lot function direct communication via chemical messages secrete certain chemicals surrounding cells pick chemicals continue alive going brain actually slow route chemical signals move way spine spinal column brain processing back spine affected cells takes reflexes signal bounces spine back skips brain entirely wait signal travel way brain hand would cooked onto hot stove time got message snatch away matter fast lucy brain process information ca get around fact spine takes time relay signals need lucy brain power ticks closer closer newfound powers become ridiculous point gains ability change eye colour oh yes subtle one suspect anything wrong way brain pull eye colour determined much pigment body puts muscle contracts pupil genetically determined eye colour set moment parents humped existence amount brain supplements give ability switch like kind fanfiction nightmare likewise ability change hair colour texture equally ridiculous amount vitamins brain teasers let even brain could speed rate push strands dead keratin head ca great way burn hair follicles follicles delicate things burn age hair turns grey frizzy get impossibly old parents even could pull trick get maybe one two good uses hair follicles gave decided make look like einstein forever things get progressively sillier starts seeing hearing spectrums human senses ca detect make accurate medical diagnosis standing room someone picks nifty ability control time along way like fucking prince persia finally happens keanu reeves okay lucy i bite happening i friggen idea director watch matrix storyboarded scene sifting waves invisible cancer tastic radiation bombard every day hallucination brought big bag drugs ingested i paying enough attention point movie gather supposed flicking limitless amounts information available super duper brain i sitting looks like movie industry worst stab depicting autism since beautiful mind connection lucy australopithecus makes sense throughout movie recurring motif wherein lucy drug mule compared lucy australopithecus movie subtle way explaining lucy one get fantastic powers shares name first woman ever lived sharing first name basically good sharing destiny across million years human development fossilized lucy leap forward human evolution scarlett johansson lucy represents exact leap forward modern humans neat little connection adds another layer significance movie would true really see resemblance first actually real first woman modern humans traced back mother side problem lucy movie producers thinking mitochondrial eve woman lived east africa sometime years ago well lucy time mitochondrial eve lived wake sort disaster wiped human race managed breed prolifically walking around variation mitochondrial dna nearly quarter million years later future reference writers filmmakers want play around themes common genetic ground mitochondrial eve want lucy impress anthropologist friends reminding audience entire species little bit inbred european asian descent got healthy chunk neanderthal real lucy far tell adult australopithecus afarensis died unknown causes around million years ago nothing particularly special save fact complete specimen species ever found great leap forward evolution first kind exceptional way tell random australopithecus happened kind enough die somewhere would preserve bones millions years named beatles song playing found chances even direct ancestor modern humans remember mysterious disaster i talked earlier history likelihood lucy bloodline would ended well came include scarlett johansson i bet ca even climb trees feet lucy would disgusted filmmakers actually wanted link main character oldest known hominin women ever discovered movie would named ardi ardi ardipithecus ramidus member species believed 'missing link apes hominins lived full million years lucy showed lucy 'wisdom worthless early movie becomes clear lucy drug doomed much time left live especially ridiculous bit nonsense i address next point needs figure make last hours meaningful unite four forces physics design better scientific method invent better statistics create great works art design experiments lead medical breakthroughs program artificial intelligence equivalent human mind god would useful instead chooses flap hands around wax poetic time space see individual reaches infinite speed image seems disappear longer travels time without time cease exist also i ten fingers hand actually really clever thought clever einstein published freaking apparently lucy clever enough realize scientists converses end movie stray janitors lab coats anyone actual expert sort science immediately recognize lucy spouting year old theory special relativity reciting einstein exactly groundbreaking point lucy contribution world bizarre video clip goes back time modern day times square creation universe brief stop chill three million year old namesake equally worthless yes looks awesome sure managed create accurate computer simulation shows events occurred entire existence universe pretty neat scientifically worthless science based replication peer review results verified sourced order mean anything yes scientists go lucy little simulation use prove giant impact hypothesis moon formed going believe ca jot 'a woman super brain drugs wrote me computer program says right references section paper far scientific community concerned lucy 'knowledge reliable rantings average homeless soapbox preacher stuff made drugs without research observations experiments face get start citing random drug addicts sources end movie hear lucy drop one last nugget wisdom disembodied voice tells life given billion years ago know fucking lucy gave bunch hippie pseudo science babble universe connected would made jack kerouac roll eyes thing said could reasonably construed advice stop time one really plans anyway 'death makes absolutely sense good things ca last forever lucy exception moment new brain power sets lucy knows days numbered cells replicating alarming rate maintain jimmy neutron brain blast matter time entire body erodes pile dust like fucking sandman apparently also apparently erodes ability feel empathy sociopathic shell former self discussion another day movie lucy gets taste consequences drugs body starts dissolve airplane bathroom problem handily fixes shoving drugs face lucy problem cells divide far rapidly dissolving developing every form cancer known man humanoid shaped tumor woman completely control immune responses even problem technically develop cancer every single day life reason able stave full fledged cancer late life immune system cells able detect locate destroy damaged cells start divide control lucy ability super power immune system thing make sure body defect free sit shovel enough peanut butter fuel revved immune system danger immediate death freaking biologically immortal trait would share mighty lobster really words nonsense leads lucy ultimate sort demise sensing upcoming failure body lucy expends last energy turn giant pillar black goo eventually spits flash drive full lucy wisdom collapsing people lucy shoot begin mourn emotionless dead eyed woman tolerated message lucy pops someone cellphone still really dead still alive uh sort sentient wi fi ghost uhhh great raises whole lot questions answers thankfully movie comes end director enough self awareness realize shot foot lot i could say movie like fact main character limitless superpowers mean absolutely real suspense point ridiculous surgery scene fact interpol hands kilogram drugs strange woman tells i leave i mentioned earlier i tolerate stupid movies i ca tolerate movies openly spread misinformation remember people think watching brain
