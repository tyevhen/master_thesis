previous post i concluded conscious states human beings far complicated allow algorithmic decision whether candidate euthanasia assisted suicide argument may clear anyone psychiatric experience i thought i would add examples fairly standard clinical scenarios specific case reports scenario year old man long history alcoholism presents assessment possible bipolar disorder euphoric grandiose appears mildly intoxicated psychiatrist performs clinical interview includes standardized cognitive screen cognitive screen patient performs perfectly person level academic occupational achievement including tests short term working memory returns two weeks later follow recall ever meeting psychiatrist cognitive exam scenario year old woman history bipolar disorder presents follow recent hospitalization psychiatrist also works hospital provided care inpatient unit follow visit patient asks psychiatrist recognized fact myself either hospital time discharge asked specific said angry attempted drown hospital disclose psychiatrist nursing staff criticized psychiatrist recognizing suggested never discharged scenario year old woman seen depression recurrent episodes depression following episode postpartum depression age maintenance antidepressant therapy since age requested appointment seemed like maintenance therapy longer effective appointment appears mildly depressed depressogenic thinking seem much different many similar episodes past generally required minor adjustments medication supportive psychotherapy cognitive behavioral interventions changes made suicide risk assessed standard way psychiatrist past history suicide attempts deterrents suicidal behavior discussed reminds psychiatrist religious religion strong proscription suicide follow appointment set three days later patient husband calls psychiatrist let know patient attempted suicide recovering local hospital scenario year old man seen heroin addiction depression hospitalized following accidental heroin overdose contemplating transfer residential treatment substance use disorders interview discusses depression result guilt regret activities engaged steady supply heroin talks activities detail including stealing friends family dealing drugs one case witnessing episode drug dealers severely beat one acquaintances point person nearly died concludes activities me i raised way i values i break law i break law every day matter time i end prison i ca anymore psychiatric consultant asks decision go rehab hospital arrangements made patient says i think i ready stop using heroin yet short list i see changes conscious state well captured described current psychiatric nomenclature part comes fact psychiatry subspecialty medicine medical classifications nature imprecise linear somewhat static ideal medical diagnosis implies certain general course prognosis selection process find static linear processes ideal terms meeting criteria dynamic processes change minute minute hour hour human consciousness changes shorter time frame nonlinear therefore unpredictable certainly drastic persistent changes consciousness easily recognizable like delirium dementia even scenarios outlined suggest significant disruptions consciousness point result amnesia unpredictable suicidal behavior suicide attempts drug addiction would consider alcohol induced amnesia blackout severe disruption purely subjective judgment possible people hundreds thousands blackouts appear functional time certainly major problem high risk problem risky suicide attempt results hospitalization decision continue heroin right overdose tolerance waning recognition conscious states exist makes psychiatrist far better clinician much less likely get angry upset unpredictable events like suicide attempts relapses drug alcohol use appreciation fluidity human consciousness precludes angry blaming patient something happens outside limited standard evaluation strong tendency physicians unaware phenomenon either get angry think patient lied original assessment adopt fatalistic attitude events unpredictable nothing done adapt paternalistic attitude sympathize person mysterious disease blamed none attitudes captures true conscious state individual interventions done reduce risk rapid changes conscious state currently empirical question lot depends ability detect persons problem certainly plenty people told physician suicidal went short period time attempt complete suicide cases survivors available interview hospital settings interviewing survivors self inflicted gunshot wounds common patient recall pointing gun recall pulling trigger survivors jumped gold gate bridge almost regret jumping feet away rail minimum suggests conscious state actively suicidal person transient impulsive unpredictably driven suicidal plan young opioid addicts common days generally personify hijacked brain hypothesis brain biased continue addiction associated behaviors stark contrast previous moral development educational vocational trajectory clinician aware changes conscious state educate patient happening assessment suicidal risk discussion risk mitigating factors i think reasonable discussion patient current conscious state risk based conscious state well fact conscious states change cases high risk state psychiatrist interviewed survivors suicide often struck person describes

last years certainly checklist mass medication approach promoted collaborative care focus consciousness best way help patients best way learn brain really working george dawson md dfapa supplementary
