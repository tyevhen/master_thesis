recent example reported involved known patient held police custody norfolk hours beds anywhere within entire norfolk suffolk foundation trust area eventually admitted hospital brighton miles away creating intolerable situations amhp police finding legal limbo let me illustrate venn diagram mental health cop keen venn diagrams first law law encompasses legislation relating people mental disorders includes mental health mental capacity human rights reality reality world amhp police others actually live two together law reality unfortunately overlap perfectly area reality lies outside law joe many others find amhp police deal legal limbos daily basis real life scenarios i colleagues deal david arrested affray taken local police station becomes apparent custody sergeant may mentally disordered requests assessment mha amhp doctors assess david decide needs detained unable make application bed available police concluded investigations decided take action intend bail therefore longer legal authority continue hold police custody happens next amhp completed application mha makes patient liable detention patient ambulance way hospital authorisation following behind receive

assist finding suitable alternative patient may involve making new application different hospital situation sort considered serious failure recorded investigated accordingly i think i would inclined continue journey hospital basis still least theoretically liable detention argue toss code suggest patient may legally held another bed found could conceivably case unlawful imprisonment limbo period scenario norman mha patient detained nearest relative object refusal nr discovering nearby hospital would therefore mean patient detained possible displace nearest relative certain circumstances county court displace nr nearest relative objected unreasonably application admission treatment para cop could done situation i think would difficult argue successfully particular nr objected unreasonably would like unwell relative taken many miles away home would almost impossible visit case amount time would take make application court would make unfeasible amhp suggested refuse assess patient bed identified problem expressly law mha explicitly states local social services authority reason think application admission hospital may need made respect patient within area shall make arrangements approved mental health professional consider patient case behalf assessed patient amhp satisfied application ought made respect patient duty make application amhp decide make application refuse request make assessment absence hospital bed admit patient absolve duty nhs clinical commissioning groups ccg prepared meet obligations para code responsible commissioning mental health services meet needs areas ensure procedures place beds identified required looks like still going left poor amhp police try prevent legal black holes enveloping everything finally making mental health unworkable
