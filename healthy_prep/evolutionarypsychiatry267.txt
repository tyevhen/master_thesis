thank good paleo fairy melissa mcewan count next time i nyc i owe half dozen norcal margaritas thank also former primal muse moved paleo guy i send margarita machine i little hands several creatine fed vegetarians papers seems cognition researchers athletic performance researchers simply love giving vegetarians creatine practice might seem curious look facts creatine amino acid found animal flesh abundantly skeletal muscle flesh like steak essential amino acid synthesize amino acids found also plant foods changing plant based omega fatty acid ala marine animal based omega acid dha synthesis inefficient known vegetarians lower tissue measured directly via muscle biopsy amounts creatine omnivores care creatine well recall cells run energy supplied atp whether fuel glucose ketones eventually raw materials get transformed atp broken powers sorts energy requiring processes obviously burn atp faster muscles running jumping performing various feats strength also burn atp faster using noggins something bit complicated little brain size two fists held together burns energy use day primarily keep ion gradients fueled allow neurons charge discharged communicate information creatine bind phosphate p make phosphocreatine acts buffer make atp lickety split turns make atp times faster using phosphate reserves phosphocreatine using oxidative phosphorylation whopping times faster making atp de novo think hard brain levels phosphocreatine drop pretty acutely atp levels stay constant showing bust reserve keep thinking sharp short creatine improves brain efficiency let look papers shall cognition study papers healthy college students recruited colleges good source research volunteers vegetarians divided creatine placebo supplementation groups british study compared vegetarians vegan young women omnivores australian study used vegetarians vegans crossover design subjects got placebo creatine along way studies various measures cognitive memory testing number words remember list read many f p words say minutes many numbers repeat backwards string numbers read recognizing strings three even odd numbers series numbers read per second british study added measure reaction time subjects press button corresponding light fast could lit australian study weeks british study days used creatine monohydrate supplement dextrose glucose control glucose administration shown immediately increase cognitive performance cognitive testing done fasted day supplementation results first everyone vegetarian omnivore placebo creatine british study worse second time around memory tests maybe got bored compared placebo group omnivores british study creatine supplement group omnivores shown benefit maximum grams day first maintenance grams per day supplementing athletic performance suggesting animal flesh eaters physiologically appropriate amount phophocreatine reserve brain interesting tasks pushing buttons response light stimuli complicated mental tasks involve prefrontal cortex hippocampus vegetarians creatine group much better vegetarians placebo group second battery tests involving word recall measures variability reaction times simple mental tasks improve vegetarians omnivores suggesting interestingly enough complicated thinking burns energy uncomplicated thinking smart people burn calories i aware research effect fact i thought much difference look measures vegetarians higher omnivores baseline way general memory tests two groups vary baseline vegetarians seemed benefit much creatine supplementation australian study using vegans vegetarians creatine supplementation significant positive effect working memory using backwards digit span intelligence measures requiring processing speed various cognitive tasks worse placebo vegetarians compared creatine vegetarians similar affected adhd schizophrenia dementia traumatic brain injury addition people apoe allele therefore vulnerable developing alzheimer seem lower brain levels creatine simple simple better creatine except wee wrinkles turns creatine supplementation seems effect glucose regulation weirdly first study shows higher glucose level oral glucose tolerance load vegetarians second study young athletically active males shows lower amount area oral glucose tolerance test curve good shows increased glycemic control creatine supplementation consider fact ready supply glucose short term improve cognitive performance british investigators wondering creatine supplementation increased glucose vegetarians thus increasing cognitive performance bother measure glucose subjects though knows australian study glucose measured fasting subjects specific levels reported paper seem anyone high level addition creatine tissue necessarily equal creatine brain however animal studies shown problems creatine transporter brain shows cognitive problems similar unsupplemented human vegetarians compared supplemented vegetarian brethren however likely synthesis transport mechanisms upregulated vegetarians low levels creatine creatine might pack punch early veggies levels become saturated well i interested supplementing creatine i interested continuing eat steak efficient energy reserves available brain another question low levels creatine contribute parkinson vegetarians vulnerable parkinson i sure provenance interesting document i found internet seems written vegetarian physician advocate joel furhman though suggested food pyramid allow animal products small tippy top two case studies vegans developing parkinson blaming low levels dha dr furhman peddling vegan dha product maybe creatine deficiency could implicated knows i eating plenty meat safe
