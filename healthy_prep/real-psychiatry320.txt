i remember first time i experienced significant knee pain wife i purchased old house part sweat equity young homeowners going refinish hardwood floors ever tried imposing part task sanding floors hardwood floor sanders heavy pieces equipment cast iron bodies first task carry machine i guess easily weighed hundred pounds high second floor old house steps landing time i got top felt like knees bottomed starting creak time i competitive cyclist training putting miles roads hills duluth minnesota i never encountered type pain cycling speedskating weight lifting i compensated best i could taking sander one step time bringing ruined first staining attempt eventually pain went away i learned several valuable lessons cycling example cause knee pain even acute injury i developed strong preference cycling skating decided forget running couple years went i developed pain lateral knee i already diagnosed gout medical school compared gout pain musculoskeletal pain minor experience physicians diagnosing gout mixed i want get recommendation medication something else would work better instead seeing primary care physician i went see physiatrist happened sports medicine doc jerked knee around satisfied stable showed me basic iliotibial band stretching exercises within week pain gone foolhardy adventure knee injuries trying extend usual miles training rides miles buildup i riding roads washington county remembered theoretical mile loop i always wanted ride hot summer day i felt fast i plenty daylight i took mark i coming long steep grade felt left knee soreness persisted rest way knee burning i stopped i ignored ice night morning i developed significant effusion could bend i saw orthopedic surgeon next day jerked knee around told me overuse injury put leg knee immobilizer within two weeks i cycling times i allowed body get seriously whack years cycling i started realize i ended session severe neck shoulder pain numerous adjustments stem length bike physical therapist figured i extending neck far look riding position fixed problem modifications riding position neck exercises one point i almost exclusively cycling got point painful walk around block solution exercise modification exercises improve hip flexibility experience led me conscious knees joints keeping good working order i age joints joints wife family friends kind amazing hear emphasis physical activity ages yet information joint preservation preserve back many people surprised learn circulation intervertebral disks spinal column gone point late makes biomechanics muscle conditioning important aspects joint back function age also makes physical therapy exercise important tools maintain musculoskeletal function aging i develop kind musculoskeletal pain first thing i call physical therapist schedule appointment see examination analysis biomechanics problem tells me solve i process many times physician main difference biomechanical assessment actual manipulation time may useful specific exercise program make go away stay away results medical evaluation predictable diagnosis muscle joint strain use ice heat whichever one makes feel better i told rheumatologists really scientific basis heat versus ice recommendation subjective response course recommendation nsaids non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen acetaminophen i ignore nsaid recommendations take tablets naproxen every year i i consider nsaids highly toxic drugs avoid even though effective i rheumatologist famous clinic tell me best evidence nsaids effective negligible amount joint cartilage left patients came joint replacement therapy strong evidence nsaids could knock pain joint deteriorated time i ever offered opioid i first gout attack i seen emergency department severe ankle pain discharged bottle acetaminophen codeine medication totally useless gout pain clinical practice i see lot people chronic pain i notice many taking nsaids chronic basis experiencing complications therapy like renal insufficiency i notice practically nobody sees physical therapist i notice many people started oxycodone hydrocodone mild sprains injuries involving much less tissue injury many injuries i sustained sports also many people receive adequate advice modifying activities injury series injuries sustained example person keep running sore knees overweight radiographic physical exam evidence degenerative joint disease many people seem idea wear joints replaced replacements good new decide time hang start sit couch watch television surprised pain worsens months inactivity patients back pain decide pain bad physical therapy going anything i going get surgery soon i widespread ignorance neglect musculoskeletal health mind boggling me i got exchange orthopedic surgeon doctor lounge one day lunch wanted talk narcissistic personality disorder i wanted talk biomechanics knee hip joints lively exchange end agreed me huge importance biomechanics physical activity way prevent injury degenerative disease turned wanted hear personality disorder opinion one way i teach lot central nervous system plasticity neurobiology course i give several times year different audiences widely defined plasticity experience dependent changes nervous system number mechanisms lead changes kandel others pointed mechanisms animal learning two examples jump lectures first physical therapy example knee extension exercises treatment knee injuries known time quadriceps strength balance knee critical factors knee rehabilitation prevention future injuries research area shows increased quadriceps strength occur session example i use guy wants go gym increase size biceps starts curls within weeks strength increased muscle hypertrophy biceps diameter unchanged two examples common common thread cns plasticity everything allows plasticity allow keep joints healthy relatively pain free allow willing accept idea pain come deconditioning biomechanical problems reversible plastic mechanisms additional information needed safe exercise provided physician physical therapist lesson psychiatry chronic pain patients certainly need hear information especially deconditioned people addicted opioid pain medications getting relief need hear information patients general exercise modifiable conditions see psychiatrists need hear message also lesson psychotherapy matter delivered kandel original example plasticity psychotherapy session brain modified exercise reason think ca modified anything straightforward advice complicated therapies success area lead limited use medications conscious focus needed maintain health like i discuss experience i certainly take medication pain physical therapy exercise adequately treats argument applied anxiety depression adequately addressed psychotherapy psychological interventions hand people know physical therapy exercise activity modification successfully treats musculoskeletal
