regardless type therapy client involved therapist always responsible boundary violations another problem much self disclosure part psychotherapist treatment focused client therapist many clients come therapy emotionally neglected families origin seen families psychotherapist however unwittingly replicate experience therapy psychotherapists find either disclosing lot indiscriminately clients tempted self disclose lot seek professional supervision deal issue seek personal therapy something miss needs rectified clients hurt several years ago i remember talking client left prior therapy therapist tended focus therapy rather client client struggling breakup therapist divulged also gone breakup relationship client felt therapist completely hijacked sessions personal details therapist breakup particular client history feeling seen mother always tried one client whatever problem client child client feeling bad something mother made point tell feeling worse client emotionally depriving experience growing prior therapist seemed caring ways without realizing created experience therapy i often client permission i called prior therapist discussed aspect well aspects prior therapy unfortunately therapist well trained prior conversation idea self disclosure affected client worse still seemed therapeutic reason self disclosure ever misguided might seemed forethought although seemed caring person poor boundaries psychotherapy sessions job criticize correct i wanted understand perspective happened since i dealing aftermath boundary violation current therapy client psychotherapists must self disclose based best client another problem much self disclosure affects client transference therapeutic relationship basic level transference understood feelings often projected sometimes quite accurate client towards therapist many times client transfers feelings mother father onto therapist therapist psychoanalytically psychodynamically trained use transference work client issues working transference usually provides emotionally safe place clients work issues therapy could work families origin obviously client knows therapist less room transference deprives therapist client important aspect therapeutic environment healing growth much self disclosure much reasonable people disagree like things depends particular client therapist relationship usually obvious therapists self disclosure client demands self disclosure starting go seductive slippery slope possible boundary violations treatment needs dealt avoided safety effectiveness treatment inadvertent self disclosure i mean self disclosure might occur unintentionally instance i remember psychiatrist psychoanalyst telling me years ago one clients felt deeply crushed saw psychiatrist driving chevy rather mercedes benz luxury car client happened walking along street psychiatrist driving planned event one could accuse psychiatrist perpetrating boundary violation yet client extremely upset transference towards psychiatrist needed see psychiatrist particular way seeing driving chevy fit picture needed according psychiatrist incident subject numerous psychotherapy sessions client

growing unfortunately often saw father disempowered ultimately started source pain disappointment client turned rich fruitful topic mined psychiatrist happened extraordinarily talented caring psychoanalyst experience i run clients outside therapy room several times years often common occurrence small towns would think would happen often nyc experience clients running therapist restaurant neighborhood big deal clients deeply exposing experience prefer think therapists remaining therapy room next session clients express curiosity incidents others want know anything uncomfortable even discussing made feel see therapist outside therapy room rich material explore treatment often deeper meaning psychoanalytic training i obtained training substance abuse field initially i surprised somewhat concerned much substance abuse counselors disclose clients many although substance abuse counselors recovering addicts often disclose experience clients come treatment time i think done service clients know counselors understand personal level going sort joining client i understand often helps dispel shame many clients feel addiction also raises question large topic article whether therapist counselor must experience client order effective i would say self disclosure circumstances many factors considered many cases enhance work i also seen cases detrimental therapist counselor make certain assumptions client might true much depend training expertise particular professional involved however i believe like form self disclosure done much caution forethought particular client involved always primary interest client counselor benefits carefully attuned self disclosure psychotherapy benefits carefully attuned self disclosure psychotherapy compared prior times psychotherapists encouraged blank slates clients unrealistic often emotionally depriving clients psychotherapists today recognize self disclosure done therapeutically appropriate way beneficial times clients also even therapist make overt self disclosures clients astute often intuitively pick aspects therapist personality therapist state therapist looking tired opinion therapists never complete blank slates i believe therapists need exquisitely carefully attuned particular client particular client therapist relationship effect self disclosure treatment self disclosure always done service client treatment satisfy needs therapist making distinction always easy many therapist especially full time private practice feel isolated times work careful self disclose way satisfying emotional needs rather serving client also important therapists rigorous professional training including clinical supervision also rich personal collegial relationships would self disclosure beneficial clients circumstances often psychotherapists self disclose judiciously client needs time instance gay lesbian clients want therapist know gay lesbian therapist outset psychotherapists open self disclosing sexual orientation often open clients want gay lesbian therapist however although often positive use self disclosure assumed self disclosure wo also create problems therapy regard client transference issues like topic client project feelings inadequacy internalized homophobia onto therapist self discloses gay might start client positive transference therapist could turn negative transference quickly therapist psychoanalytically psychodynamically trained positive negative transference useful furthering treatment psychotherapists must use good judgment self disclosing beneficial self disclosures might much smaller less personal instance case client came therapy difficulty asserting particular problem one day asserting insurance company getting runaround bounced one representative another result hospital claim paid insurance company paid client getting bills hospital point i told i faced similar issue professional insurance claim personal claim i able handle insurance company deciding respond client feeling particularly helpless situation i could provided information i thought would much helpful provide information context frustration professional claim paid i able

problem also helpful work together i assumed felt relieved alone problems insurance companies i struggled issue overcame i joined particular time feel alone problem felt empowered able use information assert get bill paid however client i know well i probably would self disclosed way i could sure would serve client instance negative transference self disclosure might exacerbate negative transference clients want know anything therapist whether personal professional find impinging i would made disclosure self disclosure avoided even psychotherapist conservative regard self disclosure often finds situations clients self disclosure unavoidable cases self disclosure must handled carefully possible instance therapist becomes sick must often cancel clients sessions recently i lost
