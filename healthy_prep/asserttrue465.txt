previous posts i talked lot mortality statistics life expectancy gave lot reasons strategy extending life identifying curing eliminating one one various known major causes death heart disease cancer diabetes etc probably wrongheaded way go example i mentioned total elimination forms cancer would increase overall life expectancy three years reason stop working cure cancer course definitely try cure cancer way prevent needless suffering way obtain major increase life expectancy increase life expectancy kind meaningful way come newer better cancer therapies basic task figure cells bodies age die best hope extending life expectancies words start hypothesis well supported observation organisms tendency age die matter diseases get get conquer least greatly slow basic processes senescence maybe diseases like cancer wo significant hazards person say years old instead etc years old real goal get cancer know senescence lots bits pieces know knock various genes fruit flies example make live twice long still comprehensive theory aging major lines research tend focus handful ideas best think ideas competing mutually exclusive theories like one declared winner rest discredited major contenders cross linking glycation theory neuroendocrine theory free radical theory telomere theory replicative endpoint theory genome protein maintenance theory yet another theory organisms death programmed certain point reached old age well ordered shutdown process triggered apoptosis theory really adequate explain senescence nature gradual thus really aging theory per se even though know apoptosis mechanisms exist current thinking cellular level least apoptosis mainly cleanup mechanism stop defective cells cancer cells reproducing let go major theories one one cross linking evidence cross linking theory consists observation time proteins certain molecules sometimes link covalently either via sulfide bridges process called glycosylation glycation glucose molecules stick proteins transform brownish molecules called advanced glycosylation endproducts ages know cross linking collagen occurs wrinkled skin possible cross linking proteins lens eye plays role cataract formation speculated cross linking plays role atherosclerosis age related decline kidney function good evidence emerged ages play role pathogenesis alzheimer disease well diabetes fact work ages alzheimer disease led many complementary findings researchers begun referring alzheimer disease type diabetes neuroendocrine theory neuroendocrine theory aging says many aging processes start changes hormone levels come late life triggered processes deep within brain theory almost died one point due contradictory lines evidence come back dead based strong findings insulin igf hormonal pathway igf stands insulin like growth factor substance activated growth hormone laboratory organisms studied thus far fruit flies worms rodents mutations reduce amount circulating igf extend life also several varieties dwarf mice lacking growth hormone gh prolactin prl thyroid stimulating hormone tsh live much longer normal siblings exhibit many symptoms delayed aging see free radicals free radical hypothesis says free radicals whether originating endogenously via enzyme action spontaneous chemical processes source oxidative damage tends build tissues long periods time oxidative damage associated many disease processes fact one weaknesses free radical hypothesis free radicals prevalent toxic cause many kinds damage many biological molecules many cellular systems hardly disease ca explained away wave free radical wand terribly helpful theory making predictions health food advocates saying years best way limit free radical damage body eat antioxidants difference inhibiting redox reactions scavenging free radicals idea particular food selectively target free radicals bit fanciful say least huge largely contradictory literature exists subject see wikipedia article references none course kept food companies trumpeting rich antixodants food packaging might well trumpet use preservatives food preservatives fact antioxidants nonetheless interesting fruit flies raised oxygen atmosphere tend start dropping like else flies early ages also interesting longest lived humans world tend live high altitudes oxygen short supply turns good evidence mitochondria organelles specifically concerned respiration heavily involved processes affect aging happens mitochondria hotbeds free radical activity fact point could said free radical theory aging effectively transformed mitochondrial theory aging somewhat technical look free radical theory aging i recommend ben best post subject mr best also fine discussion antioxidants aging telomere theory contrast theories aging telomere theory elegant easy summarize well validated experimentally leonard hayflick paul moorhead found human fibroblasts tend undergo fixed number doublings typically grown vitro stop die cells seem remember generation number die number ancestor generations reaches certain limit known hayflick limit hayflick limit eventually explained terms telomeres work basically telomeres like little plastic tubes ends shoelaces without lace ends fray except telomeres occur ends chromosomes non gene encoding starter regions dna designed help set machinery replication due way dna replication works every new copy dna slightly shorter ancestor copy preceded many copies copies copies made end dna shortened much copying lead potentially disastrous gene truncation enough telomere dna end allow proper priming copying process see big tall graphic therefore avoid disaster cell division must stop certain number chromosome replications unless course telomeres somehow replenished meantime turns enzyme purpose telomerase indeed able restore starter region dna plastic thingy end shoelace telomerase allowed replenish chromosome telomeres endlessly cell becomes immortal cases means becomes cancerous needless say considerable research effort devoted telomeres telomerase see telomerase modulated ways might cure cancer lengthen life expectancy otherwise healthy cells know human telomeres tend shorten age people 'long life families tend longer telomeres get feel things stand headed telomere research consulting resources listed molecular maintenance finally molecular maintenance theory aging says longevity cellular machinery depends keeping basic macromolecules life namely proteins dna proper working order continuous damage repair free radical theory complex topic many interesting aspects obviously space prohibits anything approaching useful summary recent findings suffice say much relevant research centers around special class proteins called chaperones specifically designed prevent correct protein misfolding chaperones proper folding histone dna complexes well rna chaperones also known proteins auto fold correct conformation time synthesis proteins require help final correct folding chaperone proteins provide help chaperones another important function refold proteins partially denatured heating turns even modest increase termperature many proteins begin unravel unraveled even slightly protein automatically know refold back proper conformation chaperone systems come rescue proteins making possible regain proper original folding chaperone proteins upregulated times heat stress chaperone proteins often called heat shock proteins names like hsp hsp imagine cell big origami factory turning intricately folded bits paper proteins folded order serve intended purpose
