menopause western medicine menopause indicates complete permanent cessation menstruation interval months usually necessary establish diagnosis climacteric indicates phase woman life makes transition reproductive non reproductive stage transition period declining ovarian function usually spans years around menopause thus refer discomfort symptoms appearing years would appropriate call climacteric syndrome rather menopausal syndrome menopause usually occurs ages median age industrialized countries first chapter su wen describes year cycles women according menopause occurs far mentioned median age furthermore data analyses indicate menopausal age remained unchanged centuries indeed mean age menopause remarkably constant throughout western world also countries survey malaysian women showed mean age menopause years another seven asian countries found women reached menopause around primary basis progressive decline reproductive power women ovary ovarian follicles greatly depleted time menopause important remember interpreting menopausal problems point view chinese medicine symptoms hot flushes flashes particular vaginal dryness due decline oestrogen therefore tian gui chinese medicine tian gui derives kidney jing interesting note progressive decline follicles even time birth fact time ovaries formed foetus approximately primordial follicles decrease birth menarche time menopause would seem confirm menopause event takes place suddenly woman life one reflects gradual physiological process throughout lifetime starting even birth confirms biological basis menopause determined woman lifetime i although decline kidney jing gradual lifestyle dietary habits childhood onwards determine kind menopause woman going woman poor diet overworks several years prior onset menopause likely develop severe symptoms climacteric years main menopause linked symptoms three vaginal dryness hot flushes flashes night sweating far commonest symptom hot flushes flashes per cent menopausal women suffer per cent may experience years menopause indeed gynaecologists say strictly speaking hot flushes vaginal dryness oestrogen deficiency related manifestations according view manifestations due increased stress time life symptoms may appear menopause headaches tiredness lethargy irritability anxious mood nervousness depressed mood insomnia inability concentrate menopause chinese medicine chinese perspective menopausal symptoms due decline kidney jing yin yang aspect however within basic pathology many variations patterns i must stress i discussing normal menopause occurs around age premature menopause may occur even normal menopause due physiological decline tian gui premature menopause always pathology since menopausal symptoms especially vaginal dryness hot flushes night sweating due decline oestrogen occurring time chinese point view due physiological decline tian gui tian gui discussed first chapter su wen says girls arrives dried age tian gui arrives ren mai begins flow chong mai flourishing periods come regularly conceive age ren mai empty chong mai depleted tian gui dries earth passage uterus open weakness infertility set golden mirror medicine yi zong jin jian says kidney abundant motive force dong kidneys abundant tian gui arrives i dong within water pre natal tian gui enters uterus interesting statement makes point calls dong essentially yuan pre natal therefore already active girl contrast tian gui post natal transformation yuan water enters uterus making girl fertile although i myself think careful making direct connections western chinese medicine case i think definitely say tian gui expression ovarian activity oestrogen determines puberty menopause tian gui derives kidney jing follows menopause physiological decline kidney jing finally i would like stress menopause neither disease pathology natural physiological decline kidney jing indeed many women go menopause without marked symptoms course may become pathology woman suffers pre existing deficiency kidneys patterns cause distressing symptoms require intervention pathology menopausal symptoms i often hear menopausal symptoms hot flushes due kidney yin deficiency half menopausal women i see pale tongue suffer kidney yang deficiency kidney jing deficiency may manifest yin yang deficiency indeed many herbs nourish jing category tonics kidney yang bu gu zhi yi

patient takes remedy long term i usually ask suspend month every months western view ovarian changes associated menopause already mentioned introduction main endocrine change decreased oestrogen production ovary main source oestrogen form oestradiol reproductive years menopause ovarian oestrogen production decreases markedly main circulating oestrogen oestrone rather oestradiol oestrogen present menopausal women derived adipose tissue conversion androstenedione oestrone amount oestrone produced adipose tissue determined overall amount tissue therefore thin women convert smaller percentage androstenedione oestrone per cent compared obese women may convert much per cent main source androstenedione adrenal glands time preceding menopause characterized increasing irregular menstrual cycle may become either scanty heavy irregular timing symptoms associated menopause may classified according organ tissue involved brain hot flushes depression anxiety insomnia poor memory concentration vagina vaginal dryness atrophy heart coronary heart disease blood vessels arteriosclerosis bone osteoporosis skin thinning slow healing itching mentioned gynaecologists consider hot

bladder dysfunction gall stones lesser symptoms nausea vomiting water retention headaches practitioners know spite potential adverse effects menopausal women increasingly prescribed hrt almost routinely one adverse effect usually taken seriously potential risk breast cancer reason hrt never given woman breast cancer woman breast lump unknown nature however view also debated doctors think women cured breast cancer receive hrt without risk oestrogen present hrt often supplemented administration progestins principally oppose effect oestrogen endometrium hyperplasia increased risk endometrial cancer two classes progestins used native progestins progesterone hydroxyprogesterone synthetic progestins nortestosterone derivatives carbon atom compounds medroxyprogesterone megestrol oestrogen given days break days progestin added last days oestrogen given continuously days without break progestin usually administered last days vaginal bleeding usually occurs cyclic oestrogen

industrialized societies hrt increasingly prescribed almost routinely soon woman approaches menopause alleviate menopausal symptoms alleged protective effect osteoporosis heart disease menopause medicalized defined deficiency disease example recent text women problems general practice says usa australia western europe concept emerged menopause deficiency disease needs treatment hormone replacement therapy many flaws thinking first menopause disease needs medical intervention symptoms uncomfortable distressing secondly decline oestrogen levels following reduction follicles natural physiological process part woman biological rhythms seen perspective menopause disease menarche thirdly protective effect hrt osteoporosis heart disease hotly debated conclusively proven many studies conducted confusing contradictory example review english language literature oestrogen therapy concluded oestrogen use menopausal women reduces risk coronary heart disease chd per cent risk hip fracture post menopausal women per cent moreover meta analysis epidemiological data demonstrates women using hrt menopause experience lower rates heart disease hand study post menopausal women observed period twelve years found women using oestrogen per cent elevated risk cardiovascular morbidity twofold risk cerebrovascular disease study also concluded benefits oestrogen use observed study group moreover two studies demonstrated small increased risk venous thromboembolism users hrt fourth probably important many studies showing hrt increase risk endometrial breast cancer review literature mentioned found since least thirty five epidemiological studies shown significantly increased risk endometrial cancer women taken oestrogen similarly review showed risk breast cancer increases long term use oestrogen fact swedish study hormone users reported incidence breast cancer compared non users increased six years use one recent british studies women taking hrt showed breast cancer mortality women compared general population rose per earlier period follow per swedish british studies protective effect observed progestogen given however studies show risk breast cancer reduced nullified progesterone administered addition oestrogen continuously rather sequentially fifth protecting woman osteoporosis heart disease must surely depend many factors diet lifestyle onset

doctors stop recommending lingering belief according younger women early stages menopause hormone risks may negligible least really suffering hot flushes insomnia symptoms often told probably right take drugs long use lowest possible dose shortest possible time researchers even testing idea called timing hypothesis starting hormone treatment early menopause may help protect women heart disease information huge observational study britain suggests women thought lowest risk hormones may actually highest risk least comes breast cancer study found women greatest risk breast cancer hormones took
