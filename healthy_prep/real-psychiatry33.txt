inspiration post story i read victims crackdown opioids number chronic pain patients described able get pain relief opioids discussed limited arbitrary reductions medications monthly limits imposed politicians cases people taking pain medications treated like criminals like treated basis people addicted opioids i extensive search several articles like general tone article tens millions people chronic pain since many need opioids chronic pain overdoing little restriction opioids good people suffer addicts misbehave die articles attempt semblance balance discuss timeline opioid crisis based policy changes pharmaceutical marketing may get opinion experts generally falls along polarizing lines end reader generally left definite viewpoint might right wrong approach chronic pain opioid crisis never explicit statement right wrong approaches way got opioid crisis first place medicine field generally approach pre existing right wrong bias least majority patients medical care directed collection heterogeneous disorders spread across entire population conditions numerous etiologies clear cure means medical standpoint typically takes number trials see something works since fraction target population responds intervention significant fraction target population tolerate interventions generally seen weak across entire population supports odd arguments like antidepressants work beta blockers work hypertension thiazide diuretics always first line medications hypertension also tempting look entire heterogeneous population think medication treat everybody magic bullet disorder really medications work way reason less robust response blockbuster drugs quite simple significant number people typically respond get side effects point want discontinue medication negative response medication typically main limitation comes overall effect medication population experience people tolerate ssri type antidepressant medication due side effects addition get adequate therapeutic response hand people respond may feel much better notice complete remission depression anxiety symptoms looking entire population overall effect medication robust mean might life changing medication opioids present much different landscape many people reinforce use irrespective whether medication works gives person significant side effects read correctly i people tell me directly got absolutely pain relief opioid liked taking much continued get prescription filled i people tell me got significant side effects opioid medication kept taking liked made feel keep mind always range effects i never heard people describe experiences ssri antidepressants mere taking ssri antidepressant reinforce continued use special dilemma opioids medications reinforce use benzodiazepines stimulants person says need keep taking medication really mean i first admit may need take medication treated chronic pain patients years taking opioids still pain degree also believed opioid providing degree relief visible sign could take opioids chronic basis escalate dose get additional opioids addictive drugs medical non medical sources obvious question case increase dose opioid get rid pain answer medication even opioids completely alleviate chronic pain i many acute pain sufferers tell me get much relief acute pain opiates non specific effects like sleep took another factor consider chronic pain patients come addiction treatment centers feel markedly better less pain tapered opioids placed non opioid medication pain people often surprised hear based i said surprising taking medication completely eliminate chronic pain lot side effects biases taking ignoring side effects feel better without final piece equation addiction severe opioid use disorder stage problem compounded fact person needs take medication order function day day basis happen person chronic pain able function addition chronic pain puts impossible situation especially true escalating dose medication order try recapture original high cope emotional state get sleep many situations person find cut clinic attend exceeded prescribed amount medications precipitates acute withdrawal may seek prescription medications non medical source start using heroin i hope i able convey complexity situation opioids chronic wide scale problem opposed medications similar problems stimulus post usual swing journalistic opinion complex problems i going title post journalists politicians ca practice medicine complex chronic problems medicine oversimplified binary solutions point time researchers currently developing tools allow identify subgroups populations subject people less trial error time next years i expect able rapidly identify might able take opioids non addictive manner able might even better medications chronic pain safe non addictive meantime rhetorical approach casting people victims others villains unproductive stigmatizing i tell students difference drawing inferences people large city based amount addiction twenty years ago large city children going school would walk past three four drug dealers result urban addiction rates much higher rural addiction rates rural kids walk past many drug dealers people rural settings addicted heroin dying overdoses exposure drugs rather moral superiority limiting factor well medicine physician needs good probabilistic thinking lot process acquired rather learned rote basis errors decision making process almost guaranteed real problem physicians seem error time turns minority physicians i expect group difficulty managing treatment probabilities interpersonal dynamics required treat chronic pain recognize addiction implement appropriate interventions one thing sure journalists politicians law enforcement insurance companies better job majority physicians major mistake think otherwise george dawson md dfapa supplementary graphic supposed indicate physicians direct responsibility patient appreciate complexity situation especially
