i read something respected scientific journal set hair fire i wonder long shrinks catch science neurology evolution understanding would prevent lot current nonsense psychotherapy case point article risk psychosis sept oct issue scientific american mind scientificamerican article cfm id risk psychosis reason hair burning incorrect unscientific many go suffering due lack understanding shrink missing point kind therapy waste time misleading one type therapy practitioners encourage patients look evidence supporting delusions delusion false would force patient look supporting evidence unless course think mind psychosis therefore convince otherwise reason matter illogic logic straighten ideas voila well first let look psychosis know many kinds psychosis derive imprints early lives example smoking pregnant mother lead later psychosis child many studies indicating mother feels drugs takes carrying serious adverse effects offspring anguished mother lead sexual dysfunction mental disorders years later early memory imprints powerful impact developing brain effects organ systems often matter life death mother heavily anesthetized giving birth drug overpowers neonate leaves lasting impression weakens child makes vulnerable disease later later trauma psychosis could result mental psychosis one many options reacting trauma go crazy body well first let look brain know writings three distinct levels brain function brainstem limbic system cortical thing believing one capacity reacting early pain different ways early pain engraved carried pain first registered moves upwards attempt connect cortical comprehending counterpart unfortunately repression blocks travel keeps hidden many neural pathways leading upward downward route neural circuits therefore one way two way street information flows upward toward conscious connection downward brief contrary cognitive therapy offshoot sisters ideas change feelings rather feelings move upward change ideas meant terms evolution lower brain levels predate later ones millions years earlier ones survival systems forget meant strong invulnerable could change easily weak survival would threatened primates abundance neural cells leading amygdala cortex evident higher level connections found almost throughout whole neocortex range brainstem connections higher cortical centers well includes locus coeruleus respects terror center brain least one begin understand lower site locus coeruleus connects higher drives obsessions paranoid ideas keeps awake night ruminating hurts imagined hurts projections higher areas account delusions lower level triggered current events rejection insult patient relives i call first line brainstem imprints stop ruminations delusions know among many ways lower level imprints drive higher level thoughts work dr jaak panksepp author affective neuroscience relevant demonstrates brain circuits plentiful move upward forward rather downward especially true feeling structures amygdala circuits reaching upwards toward neocortex scientists luiz pessoa demonstrate certain structures suppressed recruited feelings thereby diminish cognitive insight understanding short feelings reign thoughts want understand psychology must first understand brain works evolution built human brain development contrarily evidence show cortical insight thoughts suppress feelings structures alongside temple brain integration feelings orbitofrontal area structure relatively networks leading feeling centers let drown fish feelings drive thoughts much thoughts drive feelings undermine cognitivists see moment important alleviating suffering feelings genetically coded unravel appear timetable help survive strong boost alertness vigilance keep aware work see saw fashion awareness hyperawareness see ultimately suppress feelings time much arousal shut feelings put feeling primal zone ok let get business hand piece psychosis scientific american mind want patient gather evidence support delusions think crack intellectual defense lead patient logic see craziness see reason think way faulty logic created push powerful feelings way bind energy keep logical point paranoia trying use inherent logic make sense feelings let share framework feelings sensations great power engraved brain physical system powerful force moves toward connection go way top therapy blocked certain levels blocking occurs massive force body cells go crazy words many ways go crazy cancer one integrity cell implodes overspills boundaries power reaches higher stimulates production ideas paranoid ideation impressed pain extending different areas feelings move toward higher levels gather ideas deal thus early trauma lack love move around brain force sometimes elaborate thoughts coming get me want kill me i seen enough lead me know devastating feelings behind thoughts i dying womb may real feeling delusions want kill me case despite rhetoric death end result delusion ginger bread covering feeling important part dying want get causes need explore deep lying terror never matter logic illogic illogic often forced imprints delusion outgrowth terrible feeling designed part defense spend time changing defense useless enterprise problem feelings ideas patient concocted feelings think like thoughts come question considered patient go suffering clear strange ideas arrive give delusional patients strong medication works lower brain areas stops delusions really touch ideational areas brain yet change radically clearly lower centers send messages higher distort thinking create paranoid ideas current researchers want create another diagnosis diagnostic manual called attenuated psychosis syndrome helps beyond me except gives inventor cachet psychosis really couched behavioral terms i kidding hallucinations delusions week loved one bothered symptoms symptoms appeared worsened past year disorder explain problem want ape medical diagnosis get headaches week migraine syndrome diagnosis depends whether someone else bothered nothing nothing patient history behavior course else could expect cognitive behaviorists patients required gather evidence delusions i loss assume ideas problem history behind might agree allow patient spend time futile search supporting evidence suppressing symptoms suppressing behavior assumed ideas wrong instead seeing caused ideas believe cognition alone course higher place go ideas believe ideas emanate nowhere must believe cognitive approach may focus ideas deeper force exists part mindfulness approach head head must deal bereft feelings unattached history could think way personally skim surface therapy
