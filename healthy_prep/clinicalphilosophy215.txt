early version review published philosophical psychology recently written pulling together bad tempered wittgensteinian criticisms earlier blog posts chris frith latest book making mind brain creates mental world chris frith imagine waking one morning discover direct contact bed open lover caress movements bodies make really movements privileges direct expressive receptive contact world companions discern afforded brains must rest content side action mere illusions free side perception inspecting mere models present reality really illusions thrown together brain consolation prize actually direct contact world task making sense complexities would overwhelming thankfully clever brains perform tasks stage supplying outputs form simple pictures messages clear intelligible enough poor cognitive beings grasp frith says conclusion making mind brain creates mental world well written accessible book notwithstanding fully embraces endorses described theorization might say nightmarish predicament self mind body complex activity hidden need embarrassed go back party fun p whether consolation enough may questioned malcolm wrote regarding searle notion brain stuck inside skull searle says receive messages predicament wants messages p unlike searle philosopher frith neuroscientist aims substantiate claims conceptual argumentation empirical evidence drawn cognitive neuropsychology words key theses frith takes neuropsychological evidence support distinction mental physical illusion created brain p hiding unconscious inferences makes brain creates illusion direct contact objects physical world mental world isolated private p unconscious inferences wrong even ordinary healthy brain p furthermore direct contact even bodies another illusion created brain p perception world fantasy coincides reality p arising brains discover world constructing models making predictions p knowledge minds others created brains way p whilst experience agents minds illusion created brains p frith acknowledges experience freedom individuality responsibility cornerstone societal stability morality simply final illusion created brains p claims prima facie extraordinary neuropsychological data frith presents could substantiate one book might cause major revision human self understanding yet struck reviewer way content hypotheses data supposedly evidenced theoretical unity text derived principally unargued tacit metapsychological commitments radically constrained way data interpreted concerning perception frith cites three sorts evidence claim even senses intact brain functioning normally feeling direct access physical world illusion created brain p first chapter provides evidence various malfunctions curiosities regarding visual experience change blindness subliminal perception visual illusions synesthesia dreams visual hallucinations etc second chapter cites fact direct mapping sensory retinal stimulation onto contents consciousness third chapter notes normally unaware vast amount complex neurophysiological processing activation motor programs say subtends everyday experience infers perception world brain model world p whilst data fascinating also incapable motivating frith theoretical claims instead appear consistently driven homuncular conception self constantly invoked data interpretation homuncular i mean conception subject relation brain harnesses mentalistic conception immediate contents perceptual consciousness inner images internal representations occurring minds causalist construal immediate contents final products delivered mind cns worked information originally received sense organs kenny conceptions consciousness inner stage cartesian theatre dennett populated inner visibilia may explicitly posit actual homunculus audience philosophical concern however ontological methodological kenny theories deploying conception neglect demonstrate rather simply assert reduplicate phenomenon perceptual consciousness aim explain following representative examples taken making mind sense organs said work like video recorder transmitting information physical world minds p brain described showing false information p telling everything knows p simply transmit ting knowledge like passive tv set actively creating pictures world limited imperfect signals provided senses p brain manages create me experience constant unchanging world i move p also constructs models p physical mental worlds others p accordingly dreams illusions offered ch evidence direct visual access world conception constrains interpretation data already presupposes witnessing world accurately must kind yet unexplained perceptual system accurately witnessing inaccurate mental images world ch facts retinal images inverted two dimensional duplicated cited movements images ambiguous movements perceived objects movements eye head simply presupposed since perception construed input consciousness work visual system must understood one undoing infelicities introduced sensory surfaces pointed ch vast complexities cns information processing completely unknown inference straightway drawn therefore aware must neither world around neurological processes supposed illusory upshots perhaps i confess i convinced kenny calls homunculus fallacy indeed fallacy dennett right deconstruct cartesian theatre whilst confessional mode i might also relate frith description mere brain engaged personal level activities knowing believing interpreting deploying bayesian inferences etc strikes me implicating another mereological fallacy ascribing part coherently ascribed whole bennett hacker yet intent foist wittgensteinian sensibilities onto reader merely relate frith striking theses regarding allegedly illusory nature experience world quite simply function data presents rather homuncular framework used interpret whatever make framework perhaps set harmless metaphors may also best way take frith theories similar presentations interesting data recruited tacitly homuncular theorizations self arise throughout book whether considering perception ch interpersonal understanding ch planning ch action ch example chapter relates

could find crest thought might find secret part really charge frith seems miss descriptions precisely everyday intentional action rather extremely alienated state mind briony dissociated lived bodily
