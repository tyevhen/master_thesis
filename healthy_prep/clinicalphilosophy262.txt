psychoanalysts theorise phenomena projective introjective identification metapsychological way making psychological processes phenomena involve one person call patient either unconsciously taking leave part self certain unpleasant feelings belonging part kind hallucinating tacitly attributing another person call analyst taking part personality affect another attributing least sometimes curious unconscious processes leave analyst actually feeling feelings projected perhaps feeling depleted might sound bit mad someone situated intellectually outside clinical encounter i honest lots clinicians empiricist stripe myself go psychoanalytic concepts either i think cases one argument one partner least part issue responsible bad state affairs find highly charged emotional atmosphere makes hard know intentions belong attribute agency responsibility ii think psychotic cases delusional people distinguish others say others say others perhaps always say exactly like lots good examples transitivism reversal opposite occur psychiatric psychoanalytic literature including classic book autobiography schizophrenic girl louis sass josef parnas paper phenomenology self disturbances schizophrenia psychological processes i mean processes explicable terms beliefs intentional attitudes subject i want propose alternative ontological model suggests processes explicable terms subject represents rather terms actual constitution subject self identification failure constitution case thinking ontologically rather ontically empirically since often case one contingent instance selves pre exist interpersonal encounters i take fairly standard commonsensical view i disagreeing yet neither case empirical idealism self selves constituted perceptual acts reconstructed experiential data example view incoherent since forced posit experiences belonging one order construct selves question experiential deliverances rather la merleau ponty i read visible invisible constitution self interpersonal encounter ontological mode i call conversation thought mutually constituting processes similarly perception demarcation subject perceptual object also thought mutually constitutive way i flesh follows field resonance field objects states affairs i kind communion communion characterised empirically follows identical neurological processes start either i example move past object object moves past me occurs pretty obviously level retinal stimulation claim essential important aspect perception cognitivist like chris frith tend think changes sensory stimulation caused perceiver must somehow subtracted retinal image order inner perceiver receive right kind stabilised inner perceptual representations match way world cognitivist like me believe inner perceptual representations kind resonance communion problem done away important precondition possibility experience similar processes occur called mirror neurones quite different level abstraction get neurons firing regardless moving feeling perceiving course solves epistemological problems mirror neurones quite sexy many people make differentiation introduction kind cut field resonance occurs nervous system responds different ways resonant stimulation depending whether stimulation arose result change perceiver change perceived important note resonance differentiation intended psychological processes constitute subject contemporaneously constitute perception mental acts subjects i bit concerned however i want play subpersonal ontological role time wonder i confused identification occurs cut differentiation drawn different place people tend expect simple failure least partial deficiency differentiation resonance nothing makes individuation self process play seems get relevant boundary self wrong i think processes often fairly stable get carried around subjects get one flotation chambers experience sensory deprivation take lsd get muddled whether train moving one next see get confused comes interpersonal processes seems helps borrow enactivist ideas suggest cut differentiation gets drawn something often tacitly negotiated within framing assumptions ongoing conversations gets constructed narratives get played families couples workplace however important read construct constructivist manner since means relapse empirical idealism return main topic projective introjective identification occur resonance inadequate especially skewed differentiation incidentally case interpersonal case subpersonal process differentiation must called cut right place counts right place function cuts typically made stable relationships fact matter cut field resonance cut makes emergence two subjects particular agencies responsibilities owned thoughts owned feelings made think would imagine already two subjects thoughts feelings ontological perspective trying replace psychological one looking constitution subjects question final point similar wittgensteinian considerations regarding rule following example go expanding course correct nothing makes case correct go like rather called correctly expanding rule get rule domain platonic facts behind rule expansion internally related primary delusions irrational virtue anything example virtue corresponding reality certain ways rather eat structure subject allows formation representations might held compared reality play corresponds game prior ontological embeddedness subject reality subject thus embedded may embeddedness throw practices invoke standards correctness however primary delusion result failure embedding fundamental processes projective introjective identification represent fundamental disturbance constitution self i individuation distinct bounded entity separated objects people capable standing intentional perceptual affective relations
