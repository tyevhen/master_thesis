codons peculiar symmetry property much discussed look codon usage protein genes organism every codon occurs roughly frequency reverse complement pair example codon gct alanine reverse complement agc serine gct occurs high rate agc occur similar high rate one low frequency low i written i want return one time bizarre crazy deserves explanation i hard pressed come one usage frequencies codons ktedonobacter racemifer click enlarge correlation tends highest organisms genomes high content lowest organisms low content pearson coefficient ranges high gc low gc i never heard good explanation phenomenon i like think aliens blame though one possible explanation many protein genes originated long ago antisense proteins following gene duplication event protein made plus strand gene corresponding antiprotein made minus strand gene copy different amino acids normal copy course codon anticodon usage rates therefore may looking echo reverse complement signal distant past another possibility antisense regions become active process gene duplications suppose gene gene gets copied copy gene gets clipped duplication new location genome gene exist without original stop codon nearest naturally occurring stop codon may base pairs downstream underneath bp region might another gene gene opposite strand ultimately copied gene overlaps gene underneath bp gene gene gene called convergent overlap overlaps common nature seldom longer base pairs often base pairs long divergent overlaps also occur kind overlap mean antisense signal enter codon pool one thing sure correlation occurrence rates codons reverse complements strong due chance dramatic example kind symmetry i talking comes way monster bacterium known ktedonobacter racemifer dsm monster sense sheer genome size million base pair genome encoding whopping putative genes plus pseudogenes codon usage frequencies shown graphic codon shown corresponding reverse complement codon length bars corresponds overall usage frequency across proteins genome frequencies codon reverse complement pairs correlate strongly r strongly chance p curiosity i checked codon frequencies yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae strain dbvpg sort relationship though strong occurs first approximation frequency codon dictated frequency reverse complement cousin interesting relationship still visibly apparent even though saccharomyces coding region gc content
