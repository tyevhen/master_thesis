time i recall using situations person treatment resistant depression responders situations response rates tend low anyway problem think chronically depressed patient going motivated cognitively intact enough adhere necessary diet report could significant side effects try kill medication discussion report one patient decided eat high tyramine content food prohibited diet due risk hypertensive reaction stroke die patient case stroke die i personally know situations strokes occurred strategy without risk augmentation strategies discussed right star exception using atypical antipsychotics antidepressants dr holtzheimer said probably common augmentation strategy risks discussed dr kalin advocates augmentation lithium triiodothyronine three slides star showing cumulative remission remission rates across levels care rates initial monotherapy treatments expected less remission rates level treatment change dr holtzheimer made point current rates remission medication psychotherapy really changed since makes electroconvulsive therapy effective antidepressant treatment remission rates relapse rate first months touched novel pharmacological agents categorized neurotransmitter neuroendocrine immunological systems say much ketamine intranasal preparation clinical trials right mention il cytokine antibody trial going right moved talk invasive therapies presented graphic drawing papez anyone trained neuroanatomy around time i medical school many anatomy professors would present saggital section brain refer limbic structures papez circuit first i thought drawing surprising amount detail publication i went original article online ama web site found original drawing used drawing surface anatomy correct tracts papez mentions amygdala three times last paragraphs article label drawing dr holtzheimer used slide prelude article mayberg providing rational deep brain stimulation treatment depression i plan come separate post technology based several sources right number centers looking deep brain stimulation depression addiction dr holtzheimer briefly commented transmagnetic stimulation tms apparently fda approved devices use expanding insurance reimbursement expanding said effective treatment resistant depression i highly skeptical number based people i see i also realize i seeing highly treatment resistant multiple comorbidities seizure risk listed significant side effect vagus nerve stimulation vns around decade i seen patients never referred anyone placement device limited third part reimbursement opinion waning enthusiasm technology last time i interviewed person vns speech quality changed every time stimulator active significant side effect i know addressed current technology transcranial direct current stimulation tdcs transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation cranial electrical stimulation listed limited data deep brain stimulation dbs clearly main focus dr holtzheimer presentation first article suggesting may effective obsessive
