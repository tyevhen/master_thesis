projection images influenza virions reference listed today good day i got morning morning news headline i waiting hear least years cbs morning gail king saying flu spread breathing kind scary kind scary even scarier know fact listen years hand washing prevent flu hand washing good surface contamination nothing airborne viruses known protection airborne viruses biohazard environments i come knowledge easily medical school i research assistance plant tissue culture lab job try clone loblolly pine pinus taeda douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii trees elite seed required sterile environment tissue media manipulations concerned viruses time always experiments lost due yeast fungal contamination culture medium medical school observations contagious airborne viruses could rotations entire team ill respiratory infections i notice movement today telling physicians stay home sick people sick one teams stayed home would nobody take care patients i work one attending physician wore surgical mask medicine clinic barrier viruses today know masks ineffective blocking viruses real eye opener came practice years i worked inpatient environment designed according hvac experts i consulted environments days designed preserve heat designed provide fresh air manner would minimize risk airborne virus infections rooms environment individual radiators equipped fans room air recirculated top room square vent moved air length building air shafts traveled floors i reassured adequate air flow measured i provided diagrams really show solid data environment airborne viral infections ran rampant acute care psychiatric units many patients directly admitted influenza matter time picked staff transmitted person person getting one infections predictably quite depressing anyone knows severe case flu disrupts entire life polypharmacy staff subjected also impressive long complicated courses antibiotics secondary infections flu passed exposure prednisone methylprednisolone post viral bronchitis asthma exacerbations infected staff schooled proper handwashing techniques infection control flu season basically adrift tight confines breathing contaminated air well documented studies hospital building environments significant amount viral pathogens air collected number means enlightening experience involved participation two avian influenza task forces practically work i saw done seemed ignore issue airborne spread probably least part due fact hospital capacity negative air pressure rooms would immediately overwhelmed point i heard one expert say need respirator mask soon walk door hospital efficacy masks preventing flu transmission limited probably offers moral support walking environment full highly lethal influenza virus planning done task forces seemed designed prevent large surge patients going emergency department providing psychological support overwhelmed hoping military really palette full tamiflu keep showing powerpoint presentations flashing forward morning part story focused donald k milton work designing machine sample flu viruses natural setting sampling techniques typically involved subjects breathing according protocol device large reverse megaphone type device group using allows air flow past face regular rate allows research subjects breath normally sample expired air influenza virus sample case group healthy year old college students high asthma prevalence low influenza vaccination rate nasopharyngeal np sampling rna detection used diagnose influenza rna copies subjects asked breathe talk cough sneeze sampling device constraints activity asked recite alphabet minutes coarse droplets fine droplets collected separately influenza virus recovered np swabs fine aerosol sample positive proof breathing tidal volume breathing results dispersing infectious viral particles air influenza cases sneeze collection period viral shedding greater men women coughed frequently shed significantly less virus per cough increased bmi produced increased viral shedding fine aerosol speculation increased bmi make cause tendency small airway collapse may lead increased shear forces produce fine aerosol since sneezing observed considered necessary produce fine coarse aerosol coughing present significant predictor coarse fine aerosols critical paper i hope public health officials administrators architects take note takes handwashing coughing sleeve protect people influenza virus takes recognition airborne virus aerosolized breathing physicians front lines comes virus exposure need better barrier methods prevent exposure flu season i sit foot office talk people sit feet away me i talk minutes length time experiment symptoms listed severity scale incorporated review systems days people i see respiratory infection influenza leave aerosolized virus office talking me better way things minimize exposure i think starts building design rooms individually vented outdoors intake exhaust side heat exchangers exist today used purpose starting influenza model optimizing air flow humidity decrease infection rates start interviewing people across barriers using television cameras another possibility especially vulnerable populations need protected consultants may carriers tremendous lack psychiatric infrastructure compounds problem although building i refer ultimately replaced torn psychiatric services typically housed oldest run buildings today jails replaced psychiatric hospitals jail infrastructure better common see patients acutely ill influenza settings psychiatric beds need environment reduces transmission infectious diseases including airborne viruses work stop level ways hospitals buildings cleaned needs thoroughly investigated carpet floor cleaning equipment clearly leads dispersion particles carpeting floor i aware initiative make sure cleaning surfaces buildings leave air contaminated advice spread word reference anyone unsure airborne viruses i hopeful point next years environmental aspects problem addressed change nature influenza transmission well host viruses get sampled hvac systems old buildings probably long occupants infected george dawson md dfapa references
