i contacted number psychiatry residents lately blog comments encouraging remind me practically everything i post focused practicing psychiatrists especially people front lines exploited one government healthcare corporation comments also remind me retrospect residency medical school exciting time really much time becoming senior clinician vast majority negotiate turf problems cases glaring mistakes made sidetrack careers stop tracks also seems unnecessary amount anxiety typically due lack clarity plenty situations without solutions seems me never enough guidance psychiatrists training situation often made much worse fact psychiatrists tertiary care centers viewed physicians take care problems neatly fit speciality areas i thought i would post landmarks tips lead avoiding big problems facilitate transition practicing psychiatrist boundaries boundaries boundaries probably nothing important training field maintaining appropriate boundaries professional means patients certainly also professionals medical staff colleagues even people seemingly peripheral treatment process many definitions boundaries invoke psychodynamic terms inaccessible basic definition psychiatrist always aware special role treatment process fact behavior dictated professional code recognizes physician must interests patient certainly involves maintaining confidentiality also subtleties determining certain patient evokes emotional response reaction patients training programs discuss issue sexual involvement patients absolutely forbidden boundary violations subtle available one patient relative others rationalizing patient needing crisis intervention provide certain extent residency picking subtleties many cases takes years practice recognize subtle boundary problems treating family member friend colleague case point training staff always available consultation issues good general rule always see patient designated clinic appointed time correct duration always document occurred session using standard clinical documentation unexpected thought feeling part resident sessions considered discussion faculty supervisors advantageous faculty describe scenarios might order provide active guidance many boundaries clearly delineated time past example common practice past approached somebody patient usually friend relative coworker request prescribed medication usual rationale convenient get personal physician responding many cases problematic today quite easy point boards medical practice take negative view prescribing people physician patient relationship documentation encounter exists therapeutic neutrality figuring psychiatrists need neutral interactions patients takes may finished rotation demonstrative non psychiatric physician seen interpersonal behaviors observing psychiatry staff asking interact people certain way make specific comments patients important part training able explain pattern matching skills main advantage physician training development pattern recognition pattern matching skills covers broad range clinical experiences best way differentiate acute pulmonary embolism myocardial infarction panic attack see every possible variation make chance making correct diagnosis much greater person read book studies looked number recognizable patterns detected human brain visual modalities alone number approaches patterns getting top countertransference training see diverse number clinicians diverse theoretical backgrounds demonstrating techniques may confusion benefits therapeutic neutrality people see non directive even confusing patient equate neutrality inaction much better way look interact patient emotional level expects interact non productive way friends relatives interacting goal complete assessment treatment intervention demonstrate interact productive way i seen professionals get angry patients react emotionally describe me reality therapy i think reality insofar significant people person life interact way i see providing much guidance learning new productive ways interact getting rid stethoscope trainees still responsible lot medical work including admission histories physicals understanding complex medical conditions encountered tertiary care centers gathering interpreting medical tests information necessary acute psychiatric care big part missing acute medical condition needs immediate care medical condition

emergencies common arrhythmias urgently need assessed treated acute ambulatory care hypertension read electrocardiograms knowledge needs translated patient care areas include neurology recognition emergencies movement disorders especially tardive dyskinesia also drug induced problems psychiatrists know electroencephalogram useful order mri ct pet imaging i reading imaging studies i order throughout career electronic records systems seems like one functions works well resident find radiologists neuroradiologists hang ask questions images seem confusing endocrinology renal medicine knowledge also served me well years one important aspects whether resident attending learn colleagues consultants i worked bright highly motivated people acquire unexpected amount knowledge give one example hematologist taught me good way treat sickle cell pain crises patients addiction minimize exposure opioids method worked much better approach used pain management clinic stopped frequent admissions inpatient units pain crises yes need talk therapy i know myth started could psychiatrist talk people therapeutic ways completely unrealistic approach field superb psychiatrists i known talk patients excellent skills whether psychoanalysis minutes associated visit focused medication part myth seems originated inpatient side idea ca treat psychosis psychotherapy fact many situations acute care patient may refusing care refusing medications somebody needs communicate person life lot easier psychiatrist person study human consciousness even resident dsm technology lost luster i realized unrealistic categories application diagnostic criteria could rarely applied easily seemed research years even obvious people provide consistent histories time people say failing dsm clearly real way people think certainly know dsm come dsm diagnoses foreseeable future favor focus least energy people really think includes knowing human memory really works able lot cognitive screening mini mental state exam able immediately recognize pattern delirium across room includes knowing complex decision making neurobiological substrate functions applies people typically think whether formal psychiatric diagnosis neuroscience future field demand psychiatrists future know brain science applied diagnostically therapeutically logical basis study human consciousness complex decision making psychiatric disorders contrary might read many blogs already considerable progress area many excellent psychiatrist researchers area already i encourage reading research popular works starting point number luddites seem think psychiatry needs remain stagnated provide value i think shred evidence support contention neuroscience never value psychiatrists good starting point would read kandel

overprescriber learning psychopharmacology tempting consider patients constellations biologically treatable syndromes many problems approach first foremost inability recognize main problems context comprehensive formulation patient temperament personality problems include recognizing patient unable take medication tolerate basic fact many cases psychosocial psychotherapeutic approach par

told me experience hospital resident called patient discovered roof hospital went sprinting stairway intervene discovered highly agitated patient hospital clothing standing next edge roof tried calm patient sprinted bit attending bicep hard figure breach security could resulted better outcome best way prepared learn recognize warning signs talk staff ahead time work staff come detailed plans assure everyone safety ahead incidents training programs nobody ever discusses problem team player inpatient outpatient side delude thinking functioning independently patients separate parallel universe nothing could truth staff talking behavior profound effect kind care provide patients also impact relationship patient directly also personal safety think relationship everyone treatment environment keep interpersonal conflicts minimum inpatient side relationships nursing staff critical worst possible scenario resident develops contentious relationship nurses views creating extra work part psychiatrists role inpatient side make sure splitting occurs highly problematic dynamics involving staff patients avoided good keep mind reason patients hospital setting need hour nursing care
