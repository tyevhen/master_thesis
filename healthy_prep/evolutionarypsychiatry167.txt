dr eades talk went back alternate room dr feinman chris masterjohn dr eades makes great speaker unsurprisingly i admit i remember much facts talk true dr bg must post presentation adrenaline meltdown facilities came back online halfway feinman expose crappy interpretation dietary studies even crappier media coverage best example media article fat causes something horrible humans never ever eat except choke tiny requirements enjoyment great repentance i may exaggerating little based findings study humans mice oh wait even mice mouse cells test tube dr lustig attended feinman talk harangued bit actual amounts fat decreased modern diet carbohydrate sugar increased along total calories percentage fat decreased particularly relevant dr feinman point presentation merely making case literature vilifying fat ridiculous high fat necessarily good bad fun watch thought exchange much absolute fat grams today omega compared years ago much trans fat initial studies mark sisson said fat monolith one recent posts whole low carb high carb paleo issue frustrates me macronutrients alone entire picture stretch imagination obesity inflammation type ii diabetes would cured could go home

feet lecture hall day dr david pendergrass university kansas fabulous diagram painstakingly cobbled together literature outlining brain feedback mechanisms neuroregulation appetite fat storage becomes derailed promote obesity frankly renders entire fructose glucose argument somewhat irrelevant later mat lalonde phd kracken next talk excellent hard hitting i agree fact always spirit talk mostly warning thinking expert much anything without careful knowledge qualifications especially audience hard science crowd dismissed ignorant idiot i definitely agree part also said combing literature find studies support evolutionary medicine hypothesis biased therefore unscientific factual matter i agree practical matter literature vast confounders physiology yet fully understood comprehension understanding vastness possible using context interpret facts must interpret within framework practical matter two methods determining context study epidemiologic studies showing people eat take pill healthier know epidemiologic studies major weaknesses make even best unreliable establishing context method use common sense includes using evolutionary theory basis main danger bias must taken accepting analyzing negative well positive studies regards evolutionary medicine theory i think throw context altogether i fairly certain thoughts respect taking care bias i wanted put thoughts
