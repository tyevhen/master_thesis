new paradigm psychotherapy one hundred years psychotherapy little changed except cosmetically still fifty minute hour sit face face talk plethora insights swaddled gentle dulcet tones concerned therapist still horror unconscious place ill defined demons something avoided costs one says implied careful steering patient present away past freudians call ego psychology still psychoanalysis slightly different focus habiliment antique get modern facade sadly name progress moved away past present approach true cognitive behavior therapies apotheosis present move away one thing curative history historic beings imprinted neuro physiologically past proper treatment must address history sadly one hundred years talking wrong brain brain prevents hope cure emotional illness talking brain talks fine century ago know much brain contains know damage done imprinted lower levels consciousness far words live need learn new language unconscious language words feelings sensations i submit psychotherapy changed radically time always believed words could help make profound change patients call mental illness fact words often defense feeling goal produce feeling human beings mental giants important heal wounded know emotional wounds lie deep brain conscious awareness although lower brain talks time never learned talk talks nightmares high blood pressure migraines sexual difficulties inability get along others history asserting every waking moment yet go psychotherapists want concentrate solely yet walking archives living focused present words easiest access takes great effort top known access history get better need take emotional trip history undo damage reliving i call primal trip difficult ride vehicle feeling back past problems begin resolution resides knowing get vehicle feeling little complicated get right train every stop make right one get wrong train every stop wrong i know past engraved brains lifetime i know reliving changes things better hundreds studies scientific literature documenting effects pre birth birth traumas later symptoms behavior allow me relate one research experiment verify point ucla pulmonary laboratory wired two patients number instruments oxygen levels carbon dioxide blood samples every minutes relived turned oxygen deficit birth something planned neither patient observed rather pure experience part men reliving another experiment patient mimicked primal every way movements breathing except past almost fainted minutes clearly hyperventilation syndrome clawed hands past feeling breathed deeply i call locomotive breathing sounds like seems emanate brainstem medulla twenty minutes hyperventilation researchers pulmonary laboratory found patient back old feeling context anoxia birth body needed oxygen patient back every way least physiologically evidence veracity reliving patients go back time go back psychologically complete biologic state corollary early need love stays change throughout lifetime seek symbolic substitute fulfillment never fulfilling compels go seeking always vain critical time need must fulfilled past found ucla despite heavy prolonged breathing acid alkaline balance change conclusion investigators primal factor memory could account results short life death memory real imprinted despite fact blood oxygen normal room brain sending signals great lack oxygen heavy breathing ensued hyperventilation syndrome whole system back history experiencing key trauma urgent need important open whole universe depths man unconscious confirms early experience impressed memory wound needs healing endures reliving real event baby cries session never repeated patient marks originally appeared birth trauma may appear later session clearly simulation words past neurobiology remains encapsulated inside account number lingering diseases adult life remarkable never changes impervious experience matter much approval actor gets always needs i maintain context old traumatic memory curative consider session despite adequate oxygen room brain signaling serious lack body responds accordingly gasping air memory reality therein lies tale continually responding old imprinted memory reality despite current reality body smokes kill pain anoxia takes drugs beyond control upper reaches cortex reacting internal events lectures smoking little good little girl inside woman taking drugs kill pain something never see something person never sees disconnected youth feelings seeming paradox i bring cold indifferent momma session hug touch son session absolutely nothing would happen patient relives lack love everything happens normalization many parameters mother loves child originally feels lack thirty years result strange true words dominated history way resolve past pain

antidepressives prescribed brain surgery drill holds brain insert wires deeper recesses send signals certain centers alleviate depression often helps price brain surgery reason resort current therapies way access deep reaches brain depression may organized hence surgery i submit access deeper brain areas good results depression true brain surgery rather drastic affair avoided blame surgeons best alleviate suffering another way far less drastic without use medication surgery need go far deeper see experience feelings resolving means exploring experiencing ultimate causes i call cure theories evolution truest survive let stay stuck past theory frozen time basically changed advanced freudian theory little changed one hundred years attempt take current theory attach past frame reference taking new science attaching old theory longer valid progress freud alive today i doubt would freudian imagine branch medicine still grips science freud wrote major interpretation dreams beginning last century surely bit progress since let abandon past effort modernize current practice memory medicine let eschew critical medicine order cure ails
