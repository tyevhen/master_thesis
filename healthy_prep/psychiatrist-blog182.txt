way measure creative genius instead settles duck test shrink rap like things ducky i quote one second approach defining creativity duck test walks like duck quacks like duck must duck approach usually involves selecting group people writers visual artists musicians inventors business innovators scientists recognized kind creative achievement usually awarding major prizes nobel pulitzer forth approach focuses people whose widely recognized creativity sets apart general population sometimes referred study big problem approach inherent subjectivity mean example created something creativity

psychiatrist vonneguts turned representative writers families mood disorder creativity overrepresented vonneguts creative relatives writers others dancers visual artists chemists architects mathematicians consistent studies found andreasen became interested using mri study brain structure people schizophrenia pioneer field began wonder imagining studies might reveal brains creative designing neuroimaging studies however exceedingly tricky capturing human mental processes like capturing quicksilver brain many neurons stars milky way connected neurons billions spines contain synapses change continuously depending neurons recently learned capturing brain activity using imaging technology inevitably leads oversimplifications sometimes evidenced news reports investigator found location something love guilt decision making single region brain even looking search evidence creativity brain although definition creativity many people accept ability produce something novel original useful adaptive achieving something part complex process one often depicted aha eureka experience goes talk using pet scans look workings brain people asked think specific episodic events versus free associating rest random episodic silent thought based interviews creative subjects workshop study additional conversations artists i knew unconscious processes important component creativity version eureka moment answer finally came me creative people better recognizing relationships making associations connections seeing things original way seeing things others see test capacity i needed study regions brain go crazy let thoughts wander subjects spend days iowa time dr andreasen dinner house drives around acre nature retreat interviews depth inquiries childhood interests families scans brains sounds like fun i know control group gets dinner estate tour i assume studied creative people controls creative types parents died suicide exceedingly high number creative subjects relatives higher rate mental illness controls relatives though high rate i found first study frequency fairly even across artists scientists common diagnoses include bipolar disorder depression anxiety panic disorder alcoholism i also found evidence supporting early hypothesis exceptionally creative people likely control subjects one first degree relatives schizophrenia andreasen speculates creative geniuses may higher incidence mental illness one possible contributory factor personality style shared many creative subjects subjects adventuresome exploratory take risks particularly science best work tends occur new frontiers popular saying among scientists goes work cutting edge likely bleed confront doubt rejection yet persist spite believe strongly value lead psychic pain may manifest depression anxiety lead people attempt reduce discomfort turning pain relievers alcohol subjects talk joy get creating notes work much harder people love work finally linking creative genius mental illness andreasen ends mind boggling thought people see things others right call creative geniuses people see things others wrong call mentally ill
