circulation breathing person cardiac arrest indicated unresponsive breathing abnormal breathing example agonal respirations cpr involves chest compressions least cm deep rate least per minute effort create artificial circulation manually pumping blood heart addition rescuer may provide breaths either exhaling subject mouth nose utilizing device pushes air subject lungs process externally providing ventilation termed artificial respiration current recommendations place emphasis high quality chest compressions artificial respiration simplified cpr method involving chest compressions recommended untrained rescuers cpr alone unlikely restart heart main purpose restore partial flow oxygenated blood brain heart objective delay tissue death extend brief window opportunity successful resuscitation without permanent brain damage administration electric shock subject heart termed defibrillation usually needed order restore viable perfusing heart rhythm cpr generally continued patient return spontaneous circulation rosc declared dead effectiveness used alone cpr result complete recoveries survive often develop serious complications estimates vary many organizations stress cpr bring anyone back simply preserves body defibrillation advanced life support however case non shockable rhythms pulseless electrical activity pea defibrillation indicated importance cpr rises average people receive cpr survive purpose cpr start heart rather circulate oxygenated blood keep brain alive advanced care especially defibrillation initiated studies shown immediate cpr followed
