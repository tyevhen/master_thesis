i pointed brain develops three different systems i call first second third lines first brain stem parts archaic limbic system second basically limbic system including amygdala hippocampus structures anterior caudate nucleus structures including striatum contribute general feeling capacity connected top level prefrontal cortex help aware feelings area insights evolved brainstem provides energy gravity feelings first line silent wordless grunts exhibits rage terror great physical reactions never expressed words need higher levels provide words necessary less believe cognitive level make changes insights misses serious sensations exist deepest brain levels basic primitive ineffable level higher emotional one finally verbal one together form fully feeling experience relive events childhood generally levels involved memory third line add emotion therapy allow punch feeling join relive events birth gestation first line experience words even tears read speech often lack emotional level remains dry cognitive intellectual born brain neurons ever need except limbic brain cells go developing throughout lives early brain developing networks circuits different brain structures connected lack love trauma early childhood seriously affects brain develops networks feeling system recruit aspects limbic system feeling network except little emotion environment parents two stones react much affects brain development child emotions become stunted cognitive level may go developing leaves emotional level behind get brainy people feel much know much research neglect first months life earth adversely affects brain development later learning problems relating difficulties picture traumas birth gestation imagine kind long lasting damage kind damage affects physical systems precursor heart problems later life cancer newly forming heart cells cells affected mother anxious depressed weakening baby circulatory system first line damage equals first line reactions damage may apparent decades beginning vulnerability already changed way neurons develop differentiate sort detour going suppression traumas automatically trauma evokes repression may beginnings later cancer means first line repression heavy deleterious speaking cancer i hoping carry research follow something decades ago double blind study natural killer nk cells part immune system charged watching newly developing cancer cells order kill one year therapy significant increase nk cells i want research team pierce tumor take key cells multiply lot infuse extracted cells back person system slowly time i mistaken infused cells kill tumor cells nothing else lot efficient chemo therapy destroy cancer cells leaving healthy ones alone nk cells genetically designed go wherever bad cells less dangerous far effective need right money i discuss idea detour may exactly happens brain migration neurons brain stem trauma neurons may well take different route development see work bruce perry texas migration foremost earliest months womb mother smoking pill popping alters migration brain evolution one way happens born certain gene pool genes evolved due epigenetics events impacting genetic development determines nerve cells evolve dense dendrites connect nerve cells dendrites accept messages nerve cells sparse less dense get full message carrying mother smoking alter baby oxygen supply life means breathing problems later ordered evolution brain cells stem cell area upward new system appears fixed time line systems occur order speak months brainstem functions include digestion breathing blood circulation later symptoms areas need look first line events mother smoke heavily first months pregnancy likely serious developmental problems including evidence mental illness later primitive neurons long cortical neurons exist evolutionary times personal ones gestation first months life earth sensitive environment impacts saying critical windows system sensitive touched age ten going impact touch right birth means critical period first line far malleable later critical periods impact greatest always need include period studies especially therapy patients first line epoch longest lasting effects greatest impact terms evolution brain development emphasized study cornell university nov trauma earlier life may affect response stress years later womb life new organizing framework determines person faces life later brain settling imprints frame reference guide lives new research showing young children abused neglected otherwise unloved smaller brains grew loved implies kinds associated problems learning relating brains need others need attention love caring need greatest epoch critical window first line irreversible imprints widespread effects lives danger unloved mother heavily depressed drinks institutional children die love first years life instead children allowed speak dinner must lively conversations time need information stimulation need food brain imagine damage happens children unloved children critical window wide open first line birth see damage done young children institutions imagine goes earlier womb see damage earlier damage irreversible becomes luckily therapy goes deep undoes damage first line therapy never cure ignore crucial critical window much impact exists attachment theory around fifty years consider attachment baby carrying mother every mood transmitted directly fetus anxious baby depressed baby pain mounts womb life greater tendency shut right feeling brain flee left direct pain i reiterating information research show earlier impact brain damaging long lasting effects must never ignore period want help patients
