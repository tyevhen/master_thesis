increasing awareness achieving greater control body involuntary functions entering different order consciousness individual short given anything new simply helped engage means already possesses order alter attention perception influence emotional biological reactions primary significant point departure erickson spiegel area trance induction whereas erickson noted indirect techniques spiegel prefers straightforward approach difference though really significant terms fundamental view hypnosis leading hypnotherapists agree hypnosis ability talent capacity human mind alter reality ways beneficial healing spiegel frequently talks self mastery trance art form best aid struggle core spiegel approach well captured chapter book detailing work entitled mastering symptoms although erickson spiegel use cognitive approach interesting difference type cognitive process employed erickson would typically use complex double binding statement confuse startle patient spiegel present simple comprehensible linear line thought overweight patients example spiegel carefully explains overeating poison body need body live therefore protect respect body eating less overweight patient given friendly advice reacquaint body meets ideal weight like reunion old friend contrast spiegel rational approach erickson treated pound woman obesity suggesting trance bearing mind weigh pounds i want

spiegel erickson style suggestion typical types differences exist among hypnotherapists main categories include direct versus indirect suggestion overall approach authoritarian versus permissive naturalistic well trained hypnotherapists would probably use four factors depending upon patient patients respond better suggestions given authoritarian manner others receptive suggestions hook ongoing natural behaviors types suggestion styles approach incidental underlying agreement hypnosis beneficial types suggestion may vary varied accord ing superficial personality characteristics underlying intent remains hypnotherapists attempt engage utilize condition dissociation amnesia hypnosis knock memory meaning experience amnesia experience without recall many cases partial complete amnesia suggested traumatic material arises amnesia considered useful supposedly person undergo traumatic curative emotional experience unconscious level cope consciously trauma siphoned consciousness rests disconnected state trance reverie goes hand hand view reliving recalling traumatic experience disintegrating amnesia used kind protective shield integration pain however absolutely requires full cortical consciousness reason experience integrated message relay centers toward cortex blocked transmitting message consciousness instead shunting message non healing brain structures reason message much handle without totally disrupting cortical functioning way amnesia form double barrelled hypnosis person partially unconscious begin virtue trance total unconsciousness events suggested hypnotherapist hypnotherapy amnesia induced supposedly desirable way getting patient unconsciously rid trauma therefore neurosis diabolic aspect reason one get rid pain unconscious long remains unconscious stay forever hypnotherapist believes patient go sorts experiences hypnotic session memory whatsoever leave transformed fact hen induce amnesia actually happens patient leaves therapy transformed repressed hypnotherapy primal therapy particularly antithetical matter amnesia tt introducing particular case report erickson clearly describes hypnotherapeutic ideal distinctive split intellect emotion mind body carefully controlled hypnotherapist point patient perfectly possible remember intellectual facts something emotional content vice versa point felt hearted blue could life figure must reason back mind experienced emotions intellectual content recovering traumatic memory uncover deep emotions intellectual content want remember actual intellectual content need remember whether felt sad mad glad memory happened somebody else one erickson students danger flunking medical school absolutely irrationally refused attend dermatology class erickson tells student bob explanation past event forgotten asks use hypnosis demonstration subject class tells spend next week trying remember forgotten week later bob says earth go remembering something forgot long time ago even know look gone putting bob trance order find memory erickson describes memory like jigsaw puzzle put together piece piece put puzzle together right side upside picture side puzzle represents intellectual content memory blank side represents emotional foundation leaves bob choice assemble puzzle repressed memory role producing inability attend dermatology lectures meaningful way bob trance know erickson says suppose haul unconscious little pieces unpleasant memory bob thought minute perspiration began form forehead i asked bob said i feeling sick funny sort way i know kind way i said fine feeling sick funny sort way know kind way right forget bob developed amnesia material making feel funny i continued suppose reach repressions bring pieces picture bob essentially said well water something green i suppose grass green grass i said fine shove bring pieces emotion bob brought emotion said i scared i scared i want run really perspiring trembling i said shove let bring picture pieces see erickson uses technique dissociating intellect emotion associations rise consciousness erickson helps bob repress emotion became threatening meanwhile briefly feeling emotions bob sweats profusely erickson periodically brings trance lets rest hypnotizes one point tells bob put blank sides together erickson writes seen trembling perspiring actually shivering periodically i gave suggestion blank rest take another deep breath look blank reverse side jigsaw puzzle amnesic traumatic experience said whatever side something awful awful i told forget entire emotional side turn jigsaw puzzle see intellectually without emotions described two little boys eight nine years old looked like cousins playing barn wrestling oh oh one getting mad hitting grabbed forks start stabbing oh oh one stabbed leg one running house tell one stabbed little bit afraid runs along boy father mad mother mad calling doctor boy father makes sit chair wait doctor driving doctor going stick something boy oh goodness funny thing look boy face lying face swelling eyes swelling shut skin turning funny color tongue thick doctor scared getting something else got looks like needle pump kind pumping something boy swelling boy face getting less tongue getting smaller opening eyes everybody breathing deeply father grabs boy takes horse trough father sits horse trough hauls boy lap starts spanking really spanking hard boy looking horse trough sees green slime water crying something awful bad i know something awful bad i said well let one corner back soak another corner let back soak soak trough soak seen poor bob began uniting ideational content affect shuddering trembling crying horrified said i ca stand i told develop complete amnesia take rest bob little work maybe rest five minutes enough strength little work erickson flipflops patient back forth feeling feeling recalling repressed childhood trauma intellectual detachment feeling emotions associated bits pieces erickson contends amnesic behavior really patient control responding suggestion according erickson description experience sounds like finely orchestrated one man play provides controlling strings suggestion patient recalls memories represses bit shove i asked continue dropped amnesia could stand longer another amnesia rest another recovery finally said little boy stabbed one me cousin fork used cleaning barn doctor comes gives anti tetanus shot gets anaphylactic reaction edema everybody expects die including me doctor gave adrenalin recovered father took me horse trough spanked me i could even stand way cousin looked father spanking me nasty green slime water trough horrible green slime horrible color cousin face wonder i could study dermatology end wonder like dermatology final outcome bob retrieved entire traumatic memory recall six hour session experienced front entire classroom people words whatever traumatic emotions recovered trance state covered amnesia yet believe erickson account hypnosis bob traumatic memory shorn power affect next day showed dermatology almost week bob recalled attending dermatology simply took matter offactly realize missed previous lectures clinics analyzing case erickson asserts mistake try recover entire traumatic experience goes say therapists utilize way people often everyday life intellectual appreciation position emotional indifference detachment helps subject develop amnesia according erickson effective repression permits traumatic material available examination small portions relation emotional healing ideational content course examination one history needed feeling integrating feeling body system versus repressing emotional aspect suffering must released limbic storehouse raised consciousness done bits time amount pain one feel limiting factor cognitive aspect active inducement amnesia hypnotherapists suggests me distrust consciousness implies something patient experience consciousness handle assumption seems either emotions threatening cognition equipped give accurate meaning case erickson actively worked dissociate intellect emotion dissociating feeling intellect gives neurosis start first place meaning child trauma i never loved i lost real meaning lost symbolic one substituted erickson patient fear projected onto field dermatology far cry indeed original trauma stabbing cousin leg recovering meaning trauma inextricable part removing repression eventually meaning hate me want me around sums years childhood experience parent repression trauma removed simultaneously suggesting repression memory recovery ensures continuance repression neurosis best amnesia safety valve patient kind self protective mechanism inhibits onslaught much pain one time point amnesia patient defense rather therapist tool part problem part solution something respected occurs spontaneously within patient something encouraged suggested suggestions amnesia really suggestions continued neurosis ultimately deepen
