day i something i swore i never i paid elsevier copy scientific paper i spent good minutes looking free version paper online first course using every sneaky trick i know i debated myself minutes saying things like seriously going pay crooks answering course i know i ca i rather set face fire hour i realized course time i wasted buying paper worth much paper i bought paper article question called stopping active intervention caret bowen et al controlled clinical trials might guessed i going spend rest today blog talking buy paper i bought talks circumstances surrounding halting infamous cancer prevention study called caret otherwise known carotene retinol efficacy trial large national cancer institute trial go well caret actually one two large nci vitamin studies go well alpha tocopherol beta carotene atbc lung cancer prevention study caret carried atbc took place finland i going spend lot time talking studies see latest blog subject big think suffice say studies began enrolling participants finns rate year americans year atbc study reached enrollment goal people three years caret went enrolling nine years peaking people september customary large trials enroll people gradually practical reasons infeasible sign people also treatment proves deadly want able halt study huge numbers people put risk sadly atbc caret put large groups risk stopped prematurely caret halting came unnecessarily late purpose atbc caret validate usefulness antioxidant supplements vitamins chiefly cancer preventive agents atbc study population consisted male finnish smokers aged caret current former smokers male female aged plus asbestos exposed workers men aged asbestos workers made study participants experimental design finland matrix design quarter participants got mg day beta carotene quarter got mg day alpha tocopherol vitamin quarter got quarter got placebo thus treatment groups outnumbered placebo caret began design design changed early bulk study population got either placebo combo mg day beta carotene iu retinol per day thus ratio treated untreated populations according atbc writeup eventually appeared journal national cancer institute independent data safety monitoring board convened twice annually monitor trial progress study unblinded data relevant intervention safety efficacy makes harder understand atbc trial halted early beta carotene groups separated placebo wrong direction evident year eight year study people treatment group developing lung cancer heightened rate fact ended key finding study taking vitamin beta carotene leads cancer presumably finns halt intervention early simple reason study stopping criterion whatever happened large studies met perhaps divergence treated untreated group performance deemed statistically non significant never know sure atbc results appeared april issue new england journal medicine stopping active intervention caret elsevier learn lead investigator coauthors march nci directed investigators nci funded randomized trials involving beta carotene inform data safety monitoring boards atbc trial findings review data light findings develop plans inform participants atbc results incorporate findings consent forms interesting statement couple ways first say exactly nci directed investigators review data implication somebody higher lead investigator gave order whoever person knew unblinded finnish results ahead publication secondly says safety boards directed review data caret study unlike atbc safety board access unblinded data review data still blinded purpose would serve look data see one group people one set codes worse another group another set codes might reasonably assume group worse placebo group would know sure gets interesting stopping active intervention caret elsevier learn march april caret principal investigator convened telephone conference calls semc committee unblinded intervention group assignment note phrase committee unblinded actuality unblinding phone separate writeup data monitoring clinical trials case studies approach springer page former caret safety committee members anthony miller julie buring dale williams explain august four months phone call unanimously agreed unblinded nature regimens given coded groups unblinding actually happened august statisticians compiled interim report safety committee march account given lead investigators stopping active intervention caret makes sound urgent action undertaken march begin stand experiment happened long shot safety committee got first look unblinded data august doubt caret study population experiencing elevated cancer rates seen finns safety committee took vote whether stop caret trial found deadlocked two members five person committee favor stopping caret others thought would better go ahead rationale continuing spite elevated cancer treated group i quote account given data monitoring clinical trials statistical significance difference crossed brien fleming boundary i could still chance finding effect surprisingly rapid must mean real preexisting undiagnosed lung cancers growth accelerated regimen knew mechanism action beta carotene could induced effect chemoprevention trials using beta carotene ongoing stop caret would undesirable adverse effect trials owed science absolutely certain adverse effect stopping trial two members favored stop cited reasons second trial show adverse effect beta carotene chemoprevention extremely unlikely due chance owed participants prevent possible harm perhaps particularly unfortunate adverse effect appeared present asbestos workers well current smokers adverse effects appeared restricted lung cancer appeared adverse effect cardiovascular disease well incredibly even though finns shown much larger study population definite correlation beta carotene usage lung cancer high risk individuals even though caret data replicated results perfectly even though caret administering higher dose beta carotene participants finns used possibly putting people much greater risk decision made continue caret absurd assumption data accumulated bad trend line would prove nothing statistical fluke september year first interim analysis safety committee got look updated results even worse many memos meetings conference calls cross country flights nci personnel later decision finally reached mid december pull plug caret decision approved december everyone adjourned christmas holidays january letters went yes snail mail caret participants informing decision end study reasons decision caret found increases cause mortality cardiovascular mortality shown lung cancer mortality high risk individuals took beta carotene retinol engl med caret results published may new england journal medicine medical world aghast learn administration beta carotene retinol high risk individuals actually increased rate lung cancer compared placebo cardiovascular mortality likewise went finnish atbc study found increase lung cancer based beta carotene consumption mg day caret study participants taken higher dose beta carotene mg day got cancer hindsight evil game easy bash nci pulling plug caret earlier without knowing particulars frankly know finns published results april anyone could looked results looked caret experimental protocol study population immediately seen red flags even without knowing unblinded results would prudent halt least begin winding study april three half years ahead planned stop date instead befuddled safety committee bureacracy entrenched national cancer institute waited january send letters first class mail people unnecessarily dying irritatingly self congratulatory account travesty stopping active intervention caret constantly reminded study terminated months early something proud fact study terminated minimum two years later due negligent disregard finnish results known ahead time nci higher ups finns stopped early soon became apparent treatment groups diverged wrong direction placebo group say year year study argue okay wait extra two years stop caret study formal stopping criteria met phony argument caret finally stopped stopping criterion still met i said i provided detail atbc caret deadly vitamin trials separate post big think please read post deciding whether adjust daily vitamin routine end might want consider scaling back use vitamins high risk cancer maybe even high risk evidence says supplements harmful least people i post subject next days please share story social media contacts found helpful please see companion post bigthink devil data dark side antioxidants thanks
