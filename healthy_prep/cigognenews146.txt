heredity turned head let make sure understand notion epigenetics coming years likely one important areas scientific research i mentioned one reason preeminence many serious diseases think genetic actually epigenetic therefore environmentally caused possibly treatable established fact human development however early discoveries field short decade ago startling even surprised scientific world power epigenetics demonstrated early experiment duke university study showed female mice fed diet rich methyl completely altered fur pigment offspring words acted like genetic inheritance result experience something totally unexpected field genetics result study two leading scientists canada michael meaney moshe szyf thought true true experiences bad mothering negligent parenting well epigenetic research exploded think traumatic events early childhood leave mark tag gene affects forever i refer imprint psychological stamp engraved harmful events gestation early infancy burned system life understand imprint aided abetted process methylation chemical methyl group added genome restrict expression words imprint laid part change cell certain chemical reactions taking place hydrogen removal methyl infusion methylation leaves heritable imprint one passed even grandparents grandchildren research shown always thought genetic may well result early experience diverting genetic legacy short experiences forbearers endure passed epigenetic chain inheritance acquired characteristics something science thought impossible long ago another key experiment mcgill genetics researchers compared two groups rats one group consisted offspring normal mothers frequently licked babies subjected offspring stress pregnancy second group pups also stress experienced licking meaney aitken bodnoff iny sapolsky surprisingly babies heavily licked turned normal well adjusted surprise however much womb life counts scientists found right amount licking grooming early left offspring less responsive stress hormones adults know early love makes stronger less anxious turns mothers licked groomed early lives experience could passed stress hormone genes offspring could modified methyl group also chemicals beneficial way good history mother good childhood children loving mother less methylation child see shortly loving womb means receiving proper nutrients calm furiously running avoiding dangerous unhealthy situations i know someone extreme heat massage therapy pregnant never realizing possible harm baby almost every animal form loved licked grown pretty healthy serious disease therapeutic experience children bad traumatic births unhealthy gestations ones suffer adults often catastrophic early life equals catastrophic disease later life make sure changes rat pups resulted experience heredity researchers let normally stable rat pups raised attentive mothers raised neurotic negligent mothers result still unstressed babies babies birth mothers normal amounts methylation genomes thus rats raised loving mothers could pass onto offspring even adopted mother loving genes stress hormone output minimal methylation words love passed genetic chain normal babies raised negligent inattentive mothers still low methyl levels hippocampus babies started life one leg good start life despite bad childhood animal mothers licking tantamount hugging caressing humans see rats woman unhappy depressed carrying influence child lifetime even later normalizes feels better i believe changes genes methylation acetylation must occur early whole neuronal system evolving state causes depression anxiety need observe early epigenetics work pups born bad mothers reared loving mothers still seemed normal relatively un methylated one reason research important scientists found unloving mothers rodents caused methylation estrogen receptors female offspring offspring offspring deficient estrogen made less attentive loving babies yet know many key chemical processes affected lack early love idea many hormones changed neurotic heavily methylated mothers affects myriad adult behaviors nowadays seem constant breakthroughs epigenetics research i stated start researchers established epigenetics work animals among humans well aforementioned study holocaust survivors published august biological psychiatry international team researchers led rachel yehuda professor psychiatry neuroscience mount sinai hospital new york examined genes jewish subjects suffered level trauma world war ii either held concentration camps tortured forced hiding researchers also examined genes adult children traumatized survivors results compared control group jewish families eight parents nine offspring living outside europe war investigators focused specific gene fkbp known regulate stress hormone system determines well person handles stress according elisabeth binder director max planck institute psychiatry munich directed molecular analyses study found war trauma altered methylation levels specific site within gene bin site holocaust survivors offspring methylation levels site higher holocaust survivors compared control subjects survivors adult offspring paradoxically methylation levels site lower compared controls still researchers determined methylation levels exposed parents offspring significantly correlated research quickly led practical real world application august around time study released london guardian newspaper reported jewish activists scotland launched effort help grandchildren holocaust survivors suffering depression anxiety addiction eating disorders article makes note epigenetics studies document intergenerational effects holocaust showing atrocities altered dna victims descendants armed knowledge activists called mental health provision treat inherited trauma although critics say number subjects study small reflecting small number holocaust survivors still alive connection clear gene changes children appear mediated adversity experienced childhood could attributed holocaust exposure parents said yehuda statement max planck institute environmental influences stress smoking diet affect genes children words
