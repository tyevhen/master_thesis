bombshell appeared international journal risk safety medicine subject paper paxil study examined effects antidepressant paroxetine adolescents study findings published journal american academy child adolescent psychiatry new findings show i wrong paxil study know one i said overstated efficacy paxil understated risks one i claimed ghostwritten turns due legal action several documents made available shed light study authors jureidini mchenry mansfield new investigation enlightening points let look claims see wrong i i sincerely apologize story actually worse i imagined i said article quote study publication paroxetine generally well tolerated effective major depression adolescents p data effectiveness primary outcome variables hamilton rating scale depression ham mean change ham final score improved paroxetine statistically superior placebo four eight measures paroxetine superior placebo note however superiority always small moderate best margin whole accurate take paroxetine either better slightly better placebo i went bemoan authors took differences either based arbitrary cutoff scores measures assessed something depression make illegitimate claims paroxetine effective based upon newly available data study happened protocol study i document laying going happen study called eight outcome measurements quote jureidini et al significant difference paroxetine placebo groups eight pre specified outcome measures i wrong paxil better measures better zero eight measures sincerest apologies another quote jureidini friends overall four eight negative outcome measures specified protocol replaced four positive ones many negative measures tested rejected along way let break thing minute authors planned look eight different ways paxil beat placebo went zero eight rather declaring defeat authors went digging find way paxil better placebo devising various cutoff scores various measures victory could declared well examining individual items various measures rather entire rating scales authors able grasp pull couple small victories published version paper hint data dredging occurred change endpoints find one works declare victory safety i incensed coverage safety particularly magical writing stated placebo make suicidal paxil could i wrote gets even bizarre remember people serious adverse psychiatric events taking paroxetine well researchers concluded none adverse psychiatric events caused paroxetine interestingly one person became labile i suicidal placebo event attributed placebo magical study drug make suicidal placebo later document keller colleagues said acute psychosocial stressors medication noncompliance untreated comorbid disorders judged investigators account adverse effects patients sounds me investigators concluded beforehand paroxetine incapable making participants worse drum explanation serious events occurring turns i missed couple things based looking internal document calculations jureidini et al found serious adverse events significantly likely occur patients taking paroxetine vs placebo likewise adverse events requiring hospitalization significantly disadvantageous paroxetine vs severe nervous system side effects story vs authors study conduct analyses see whether aforementioned side effects occurred commonly drug vs placebo funny time dredge every conceivable efficacy outcome could see whether difference severe adverse events statistically significant one quote discussion section paper sums significant efficacy difference paroxetine placebo two primary outcomes six secondary outcomes original protocol least additional outcomes tested study positive known outcomes significantly higher rate saes paroxetine placebo consequently study negative efficacy positive forharm authors concluded infamously paroxetine generally well tolerated effective major depression adolescents enter ghostwriters documentary evidence shown indicated first draft study ghostwritten leaves two roles called academic authors paper willing co conspirators committed scientific fraud dupes dishonestly represented major role analysis data writing study fact gsk operatives working behind scenes manufacture dubious results remember study published still apology fictional portrayal results wherein drug ineffective unsafe portrayed safe effective physicians saw authorship line likely thought gee among academic child psychiatrists i trust provided oversight make sure gsk twist results wrong way martin keller lead independent academic author tragedy study said asked means key opinion leader psychiatry respected honorable person therefore give opinion something people tend listen say individuals gave opinions worth considering completely misrepresenting data study honorable keller opinion worth considering know read blog long behavior sadly fluke occurrence many others providing leadership leading race scientific ethical bottom brown university home keller universities seem care scientific fraud provided perpetrators bad science bringing home bacon one key opinion leaders signed author study said yep i screwed i see data i dupe nobody sure i expect every author every publication vouch data certainty i understand lead author taking accountability fluke may saying fluke occurrence i seen much evidence data often selectively reported manner like looks like sadly takes lawsuit anyone get whiff bastardization science passes research days gsk sued nobody would ever known published data study negative reasonably educated person could see writeup study real pimp job lots selling product based flimsy evidence nobody would seen extent fraud apparently lawyers need police scientists scientists incapable playing basic rules science see documents upon latest jureidini et al paper based found happy digging
