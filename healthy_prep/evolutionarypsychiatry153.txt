chris kresser emailed link interesting paper published beginning year thank much hope little sylvie allowing bit sleep phytic acid potential treatment alzheimer pathology evidence animal vitro models music satie gnossienne right click open new tab caveats mouse study even worse part mouse cell study interesting bits worth close look authors begin reviewing current thinking cause alzheimer amyloid beta plaques neuronal death slow progression etc etc current treatments several fda approved acetylcholinesterase inhibitors oh way work well cure go talk real cause alzheimer inflammation crappy energetics leading cell death slow progression etc etc mention funny little compound might help phytic acid whoa paleo peeps squealed phytic acid whole grains yes phytic acid one binds minerals leaves anxious insulin resistant fat one reasons eat oatmeal anymore via dr bg yes phytic acid stephan guyenet mysterious rice soaking fridge honestly i think traditionally prepared grains could healthy enough desperate taste good meat takes much effort i worry folks relatively sedentary immobile need nutrient rich calories available i actually wrote bit therapeutic uses phytic acid i pretty sneaky post inositol scoop phytic acid turns many nutrients even anti nutrients multiple effects i know shocking i quote paper good job writing study investigated novel protective treatment ad pathology phytic acid pa inositol hexakisphosphate pa structurally myo inositol sugar ring attached phosphate molecules found naturally ubiquitously phosphate storage phytochemical unprocessed whole food grains vegetables fruits key signaling molecule mammalian cells ca mg form pa found plants known phytin salt form known phytate although pa often described metal chelator growing literature indicates pa influences multiple processes including antioxidant functions anti apoptotic effects clathrin coated endocytosis dna repair mrna export nucleus phytic acid also lowers serum cholesterol triglycerides studies suggest pa possesses much broader functions simply originally presumed metal binding properties authors suggest phytic acid one many things ketosis calorie restriction etc promote clean happy humming mitochondria happy mitochondria one favorite things evolutionary psychiatry get detailed many things postulated increase sirt class iii histone epigenetic effects high sirt levels found long lived yeast flies worms mice levels sirt lower folks dementia calorie restriction red wine magic food resveratrol increase sirt animal models end result increased sirt seems increased autophagy awesome dedicated clean crew keeping neurons sparkly phytic acid brain calorie restriction resveratrol well mouse cells application phytic acid seemed right things increasing expression sirt autophagy promoting biochemical stuff alzheimer model mice given phytic acid laced drinking water six months levels sirt increased amyloid beta accumulation decreased indicators decreased oxidative stress efficient mitochondrial function evident compared control mice brain levels copper zinc iron different control phytic acid mice i wondering increasing efficiency second messengers inositol thought i described previous post linked take home message eat whole grains prevent alzheimer haha kidding actually take home message nutrition biochemistry really complex molecule downsides may also positives phytic acid seemed like least noxious part chemical warfare grains nuts fruits plants play since i pretend complete knowledge chemistry human brain i like evolutionary fallback position ancestral health lifestyle forget novel industrial foods created chemical company i wo going cute supplements outside basic minerals sunshine unless i desperate great labor day weekend everyone want add bit address rudolf astute comment eighth comment another confounder namely rats mice etc express phytase rudolph saying mice better adapted eating grains enzyme phytase guts cut phytate components inositol bunch phosphate molecules authors address issue sort though make clear humans metabolize phytic acid another paragraph paper i little irritated measure phytic acid levels mouse brains though important emphasize effects pa demonstrated distinct attributed backbone metabolite inositol stereoisomers myo inositol non phosphorylated backbone pa inhibit fibril assembly protect neurons induced cytotoxicity vitro stereoisomer scyllo inositol inhibits aggregation reduces soluble insoluble reduces plaque size inhibits cognitive defects transgenic model ad scyllo inositol elnd tested animals entered phase clinical trials ad elan corporation plc recently however shown cause severe adverse drug effects humans two arms doses gram twice day leading death patients discontinuation arms clinical trial interestingly day phytic acid administered patients adverse drug effects months study indicates phytic acid works independent mechanisms additional support hypothesis phytic acid may effects beyond inositol come studies showing elevated brain levels phytic acid rats fed high phytate diet indicating unmetabolized phytic acid delivered brain addition species phosphorylated inositols inositol metabolized products mouse consuming phytic acid synonymous phytate way phytate gets mice seems question humans absorb much phytate phytate gets pooped minerals remember whether administration phytate orally would make difference brain one interesting note paper regular mouse diet phytate experimental diet phytate diet rich legumes grains seeds would phytate authors postulate humans developed world would fine hahaha quite assumption given known mineral consumption epidemiologic studies developed world third world countries marginal food consumption ought eat much phytate something consider studied injectable one alzheimer try home quote note people died taking scyllo inositol clinical trials drug dementia paleo diet humans share phytic acid likely calories though i would imagine especially soak nuts i i eat many nuts time space mess like grains see melissa mcewen latest post information
