one great myths antidepressants higher doses effective lower doses drugs work though studies show flat dose response curve ssris better important point understand antidepressants quite often work given patient first try necessary adjusting means either increasing dose switching another drug adding second med fredman et al found among attendees psychopharmacology course asked would non responsive patient ssris chose raising dose best next step option wrong answer dose response relationship recent antidepressants short term treatment depression dialogues clin neurosci september full article patricia berney unit de psychopharmacologie clinique pitaux universitaires de gen ch ne bourg switzerland examines large number clinical trials discover extent dosage matters antidepressant therapy worth going discussion drug drug taking one drugs doctor suggests higher dose may want consider whether going worth time expense usually citalopram celexa short term studies citalopram show

berney despite availability several short clinical trials comment dose response relationship reboxetine duloxetine positive dose response relationship found mg day common thread obvious antidepressants work tend work well whether take large dose small dose dose response curve drugs straight horizontal line main takeaway berney meta analysis separate meta analysis baker et al evidence ssri dose response treating major depression reassessed depression anxiety also conclusion reached yet another meta analysis hansen et al med decision making january february said hansen group dose statistically significant predictor categorical ham response among comparative trials nonequivalent doses trends favored higher dose categories generally statistically significant lack dose response relationship certain minimum effect dose necessarily mean drugs nothing means achieved vivo concentration drug sufficient saturate whatever transporter proteins receptors drug question targets nothing left drug attach thus excess goes unused important note though drugs tend show strong dose response relationship comes side effects one meta analysis found across different studies higher doses ssris associated significantly higher proportion dropouts due side effects bottom line upping dose major antidepressants listed good strategy may worsen side effects unlikely change therapeutic outcome particular drug working far better strategy upping dose try different drug add talk therapy mix already likewise seeing good therapeutic effect drug side effects causing problems ask doctor nurse practitioner dialing back dosage minimum therapeutic dose keep side effects swamping therapeutic effect
