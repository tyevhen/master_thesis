allen institute brain science allen human brain atlas available human brain map org i studying neuroanatomy past years i started powerpoint presentations lectures projections actual sectioned stained specimens photographs combinations images journal articles lecture notes generally patchwork similar figures texts self study manual sidman sidman carpenter human neuroanatomy original neuroanatomy course focused primarily functional neuroanatomy focused clinical syndromes identifying cranial nerve midbrain hindbrain lesions general organization central peripheral nervous systems systems discussed papez version limbic circuit example little aphasiology behavioral neurology little cortical localization matter mt speculation neuroanatomists time thought medical students would pick clinical neurology terms motor function emphasis dorsal striatum discussion usual clinicopathological correlates wilson disease huntington disease parkinson disease discussion broad array movement disorders early days neuroanatomy far perfect focus ventral striatum despite fact olds discovered median forebrain bundle reward system years earlier diagrams mesolimbic dopaminergic systems even pharmaceutical company literature labelled according conventions established laboratory rats rather human brain lot deficiencies anyone learned neuroanatomy last two decades th century least far i tell i routinely teach course neurobiology addiction physicians residents i usually say something like i medical school focus dorsal striatum disease correlates know ventral striatum hang anterior inferior aspect dorsal striatum i assume learned structures generally followed dead silence i still uncertain silence means ca really study neuroscience relates psychiatry without knowing great deal neuroanatomy finding right sources critical progression neuroanatomy texts medical school opinion none better hal blumenfled text text excellent graphics organized illustrate concepts best example i think figure text entitled dopaminergic projection systems diagram illustrates striatum dorsal striatum limbic system prefrontal cortex connections midbrain structures via mesolimbic mesostriatal mesocortical pathways origins pathways substantia nigra pars compacta ventral tegmental area ventral tegmental area plus ventral tegmental area illustrated diagram one best conceptual diagrams i seen

connections limbic system hypothalamus medical school neuroanatomy texts lack granularity specific detail comes connectivity area lot lack granularity based photographs staining characteristics sections blumenfeld text talks important structure area neurotransmitter characteristics nuclei paxinos mai co authors offer detailed text detailed human brain atlas online site i still using second edition text atlas third fourth editions available time texts recommended me dr heimer i corresponded taking course brain dissection probably better paragraph illustrating significant advance neuroanatomy area chapter edition page page text refers nucleus accumbens ventral region included term substantia innominata histochemically identified ventral extension striatum addition olfactory tubercle rostrolateral portion anterior perforated space adjacent lateral olfactory tract primates also included ventral striatum heimer et al remainder anterior perforated space appears mixed area elements putamen extended amydala corticopetal cell complex ventral extension pallidum major developments along way heimer formulation extended amygdala work based advancement technology allowed clearer visualization connections basal forebrain amygdala enter allen brain atlas i favorite coronal section displayed top page per allen brain atlas terms non commercial use section numbered frontal pole i encourage anyone interest human brain anatomy go web site look coronal sections human brain every coronal section smaller image location section lateral view brain image standard image file jpg functionality web site example web site rollover feature tells exact structure cursor useful feature studying basal forebrain area relationships nucleus accumbens amygdala hypothalamus text i found useful clinical applications neuroanatomy scott atlas text mri brain spine graphics accompanying cd excellent useful orientation mri scanning one problems expensive texts useful practical teaching purposes i tried get permission several texts use occasional graphic blog teaching purposes confronted steep fees steep i mean order thousand dollars per graphic i consider outrageous based cases publication date use noncommercial profit teaching purposes case reasonable fees licensing arrangement seems impractical example i licensing arrangement reasonable rate involved me counting number powerpoint slides number students submitting fee regular basis i doubt many lecturers organized i neuroanatomy based lectures per year groups various sizes i eventually gave used publicly available material good news psychiatrists neuroanatomy never relevant become clear basis addiction psychiatry neuropsychiatry amount material openly accessed teaching purposes never better clinical work one
