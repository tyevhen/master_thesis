reliving pre birth birth imprint evoke exact reactions time original trauma absence reliving reactions fragments memory persist fast heart rate high blood pressure racing mind racing mobilized deep level imprints also inability think clealy confusion dealing imprints organized thoughts thinking clearly understandable difficulty sleeping especially falling asleep relive complete early pre birth memory high blood pressure part total reliving fragment memory also included patient consequently see relief intrusive symptoms aspects original reaction missing reliving complete therefore curative medicate blood pressure keep high level reaction wraps complete reliving possible one danger taking tranquilizers feel better generally live shorter life deep symptoms constant low grade fever chronically elevated body temperature point way brainstem parts limbic brain point perhaps pre birth experience pointing route patient ultimately travel may see problem decades therefore imagine early someone heart problem began way anxiety case usually stroke heart attack realistically real way needs way feeling anxiety untrammeled naked bare pure terror panic face threat death birth current problems neurosis traced anxiety primitive reaction common many primitive animals lizard need terror alert danger strange say need terror true nation pill takers voiding chance real health suppressing warning signs would like suppressing forerunners heart attack angina feel comfortable i know necessary moral position one survival take obsessions patients openly anxious carry rituals allowed neuroses sexual rituals another example rituals short attempt bind anxiety content ritual may little base channel first line reactions many phobias well anxiety come way i found simply going work every day observing patients session patient near deep feeling hopelessness helplessness often runs anxiety attack shortness breath butterflies stomach pressure chest high agitation feeling near death feels totally agitated wound idea stop goes feelings connected resolved person idea going incomprehensible aggravates anxiety state idiosyncratic happenstance anxiety appears nearly patients one point session approach first line feelings shattering baby infant immediately repressed interest survival also interest maintaining functioning neo cortex automatic process keeps overwhelmed allows survive drastic circumstances imagine fetus baby feels face terror fragility still inside overwhelmed mean non functioning yet children go work shopping etc time dysfunction enter tranquilizers reason called anxiety terror even though feeling sufferer never knows anxiety comes know really therefore treat separate entities anxiety began life early seem totally unrelated going twenty years later disconnection anxiety seems hang space specific antecedent patient feels trauma birth gasping oxygen anxiety becomes terror fight life home owner come high level anxiety mother contribute stress later anxiety fetus many studies bearing cited later chapters anxious pregnant mother responding outer world stirring metabolism fetus also responding environment mother anxiety goes long enough become permanent state fetus change life looks like genetics easily mistake heredity baby seems born unable sit still learn school mother anxiety stimulate fetus impair nervous system creating child imprint high level stimulation may feel overwhelmed every little thing happens throughout life adult might respond husband asking bring salt table met angry really expect me everything get everything becomes much womb life everything much laid substrate new demands work substrate one little new request made adult magnified impact chance made error something would immediately turn around make accuser wrong wrong immediately transfers terrible feelings made mistake person feels wrong ends defending much done something wrong small error resonated something important may mean i loved person suffers panic attacks means basic terror close surface hence chronic feeling overwhelmed overwhelmed feelings see example monkey study discussed later chapter mothers given cocaine stirred agitated unlike maternal anxiety attack saw result impulsive offspring likely take drugs adults anxious monkeys take alcohol makes anxious sporadic unpredictable separation mother lack steady love let suppose fears channeled elevators fear enclosed object terror terror deep brain focus higher brain psychotherapy cure deep brain terror discussion higher brain wound lies circumstances life could create phobia stuck elevator another enclosed space young child real terror life death event rarely derives happenings late childhood imprint origin terror becomes reaction phobia becomes focus need separate understand problem address imprint reaction imprint generates rest fetus mother womb external world womb environment keeps fetus alert state eventually becomes part baby aggressive hyperactive child focus concentrate class grow hyper vigilant may useful becomes undercover cop bad longevity conversely carrying mother depressed lengthy period time baby may go mode perhaps life personality characteristic may love cocaine later life even better methamphetamine puts body position anxiety often manifested choking smothering sensations dizziness feeling impending doom quite soon patient cough choke session harbinger birth pain breaking reliving birth trauma later immersed experience often coughing bringing sputum large amounts context actually coughing choking exaggerated fashion anxious help person feel better recommend patients deeper access moment simply discharge energy feeling none need cortex higher level brain function one important reason words cure basically visceral sub cortical manifestations coughing suffocating drowning telling emanate primitive brain organization time inchoate cerebral structure lacking fully developed neo cortex handle trauma insight treat began life long words first line knows words screams patients never scream birth sequence grunts moans childhood cries words screams indicates higher brain levels involved therefore true reliving simply fool lower brain higher one yes otherwise earth would elect psychopaths office lower level access anchored feelings judge veracity others saying fail see nuance subtleties feel get get otherwise fooled tricked terror see lower animals frightened another animal reactions seem like pure panic see individuals undergo mris minute enclosed steel cement sheath panic surges forth approximating happened originally takes confines machine reawaken primitive feeling patient may believe machine producing anxiety primal panic confined enclosed space womb tried exit life mri stimulate resonating memory memory way usually think sets bodily reaction kind anxiety mri exam fairly sure endured difficult birth pre birth short differential diagnostic tool separate healthy births traumatic births teach technicians perform mris tap leg foot person irregular intervals one organize full fledged anxiety reaction offer eye mask person stays unaware surroundings distraction fails might anxiety attack one good reason use words treating many first line symptoms dealing non verbal animal rummaging around lower reaches nervous system basically visceral insides feel though exploding hysteric good example someone barely control unable concentrate scattered place explosive overreacting seemingly overcome feelings times someone first line lower brain damage deprivation womb life birth words going slow person seems like rush time including rush get session wants get better needs allowed go remote places drive driven early deprivation need far verbal level person able access deep brain give painkillers suppress force time feel feelings often therapist physician sees job eliminating symptom considered sort mystery unfathomable course symptom uncomfortable could life endangering attack symptom tacit assumption good reason otherwise attack source battling symptoms usually vain exercise end
