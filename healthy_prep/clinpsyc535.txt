third perhaps final post series study recently published neuropsychopharmacology used risperidone risperdal add treatment depression study three phases follows participants responded antidepressants escitalopram celexa lexapro six weeks assigned open label citalopram celexa treatment weeks patients failed respond citalopram assigned open label risperidone risperdal augmentation add treatment weeks patients whose depression remitted assigned weeks either risperidone citalopram citalopram placebo differences risperidone placebo depressive relapse examined let start examining differences trial report found clinicaltrials gov trial published neuropsychopharmacology clinical trials report indicated primary outcome measures change montgomery asberg depression rating scale madrs time relapse measured hamilton rating scale depression clinical global impression cgi scores secondary measures include response rate measured least improvement madrs score change hamilton rating scale depression ham clinical global impressions cgi scale scores journal report results open label risperidone augmentation page early online version study stated madrs primary measure used assess depression severity nowhere results madrs response criteria change madrs scores reported go predetermined test treatment response reported means standard deviations madrs reported alleged measure treatment response strangely missing also unclear happened cgi scores means standard deviations instrument reported anywhere mentioned scores measure used one measure relapse means standard deviations missing results double blind continuation phase see rate relapse risperidone placebo time relapse days risperidone augmentation days placebo augmentation associated p value post hoc analysis found p value difference time relapse p authors state difference found switched linear ranks test i expert test i make judgment i say i suspicious time p value goes switching statistical tests least explanation article order noteworthy switching statistical test made change results post hoc analysis part additional post hoc analysis conducted using subgroup patients fully nonresponsive citalopram monotherapy words people showed poorest response ssri treatment examined separate analyses median time relapse relapse rate reported significantly different favor risperidone group relapse rate risperidone group placebo group associated p value reported however i conducted analysis came chi square p value mentioned earlier paper authors used cochran mantel haenzel test explains p value shrunk drastically post hoc analysis conducted changed results substantially yet authors discuss reasons behind large discrepancies would appear mean time relapse differed substantially chance depending site patients received treatment cmh test stratified treatment site i believe would account differences due treatment site treatment response really dependent significant extent treatment site bears mention article discussion nowhere found table results quite interesting refers double blind section study patients shown symptom resolution receiving risperidone randomly assigned continue risperidone receive placebo madrs patients receiving risperidone average gained points i depression worsened points whereas patients placebo gained points thus slight certainly significant difference favor persons placebo worsening less persons risperidone ham patients receiving risperidone worsened average points whereas worsened average points placebo two measures clear average little difference risperidone placebo however take notepads please patients groups got significantly worse time third phase study thus scenario average patient sees relatively brief improvement symptoms taking risperidone returns period moderate depressive symptoms authors discuss mean scores groups differ third phase study evidence emerge study really open label treatment resulted decrease symptoms janssen really wanted impress would included active comparator say older antipsychotic called mood stabilizer perhaps another atypical antipsychotic feeling daring least add placebo mix based study results even conclude risperidone augmentation worked better adding sugar pill ssri treatment summary unknown happened secondary outcome measures cgi scores madrs response rate statistical analyses used cases required explanation use led big change interpretation results i believe excellent example study conducted marketing purposes i bet many reprints article purchased janssen passed cheerleaders er drug reps physicians ploy market risperdal adjunctive treatment depression additionally likely key opinion leaders perhaps including study authors willing stump risperdal adjunctive treatment depression conferences meetings dinners study published neuropsychopharmacology little doubt marketing strategies glimmer scientific sparkle side although upon closer examination scientific evidence weak best yet doctors bother perform closer examination meager science behind marketing atypical antipsychotics continue march toward rebranding broad spectrum psychotropic agents rispserdal referred press release regarding present study i encourage interested readers also check earlier posts regarding questionable authorship paper possibly involving magic well rather blatant undisclosed conflicts interest associated study distressing i think i chill couple quaaludes er earlier versions broad spectrum psychotropic agents
