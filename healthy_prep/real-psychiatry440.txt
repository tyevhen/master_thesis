appropriate tone comments introduction section document identifies major entity government working managed care industry i consider ncqa nqf proxy managed care industry history i recall i aware physician professional group says otherwise fact i find american psychiatric association member nqf i fairly certain used member ncqa getting back document six goals identified page dedicated currently available measures second page described future targeted measures deemed important advancing behavioral health quality measurement example involves illustrated nbhqf goal effective promote effective prevention treatment recovery practices behavioral health disorders much stickler i really know behavioral health disorder precise definition would whatever mental psychiatric disorder managed care company decided pay behavioral health basically business term medical psychological meaning far i tell designed disenfranchise psychiatrists mental health providers yet rationale denying treatment always proprietary medical necessity criteria moving beyond basically see number screening interventions provider practitioners number completely unproven interventions quality markers least cells matrix left intentionally blank exactly comment second page payers using payment incentives increase use ebp evidence based practices actually considered quality marker conflict interest much greater pharmaceutical company scandal translate means managed care companies nation wide another way deny payment save money based consider evidence based practice rationalizing quality marker let me suggest depression assessment screening done matrix first screening test case phq need validated diagnostic outcome measure populations current literature extremely limited evidence population screening depression accomplished anything exposing lot people antidepressants fda identified potentially arrhythmogenic cost prescribing ssris large population well electrocardiogram abnormalities unknown i briefly comment additional goals goal person centered care previously explained goal every physician ever trained medical school appears basically rhetoric designed disenfranchise professionals make seem like managed care companies invented individualized care goal encourage effective coordination within behavioral health jumps page me sparsely populated matrix ratio detox

assessment treatment capture problems areas need quality process piecemeal check box gamed appears providing quality care measuring variables absence defining quality process meaningless goal affordable accessible foster affordable high quality behavioral health care continues absurd priority partnership government managed care system cost effective approach passes behavioral health care mental health treatment decimated years managed care point practically non existent time addition trillions dollars cardiology intensive care oncology infrastructure even true evidence cost effectiveness quality certainly reflected previous specialties i listed problems approach turns major problems couple administrative data administrators significant biases seem impact called quality markers across board seem understand biases major biases include really knowing anything medical quality thinking medical quality derived basically administrative data length stay readmissions etc point time much political leverage government backing really pay attention considerable number people know lot quality i documented blog thirty year trend captured nbhqf followed quality markers last two decades probably made observation business heavy entities like managed care systems information averse i mean collect large amount data really enough data right data great examples hedis data phq scores really possible collapse medical quality really simplified demographic parameters knowing year old men coronary artery disease business practices trumping medical practice blog i also reviewed practices focus one glares report person centered care years hmos administrators focused population based care scoffed notion people patients needed treated individual basis peak time deciding everyone certain condition hospitalized number days quality problem length stay hospital long nobody ever complained length stay short many thought leaders managed care go position basically promoting ideas managed care industry suddenly behind person centered care wo see history recorded anywhere lot goes back primary care physician gatekeeper assume managed populations people interventions tell subscribers get referrals primary care physician tests consultations viewed outside population norm happening large scale subscribers rebelled paying good money insurance coverage seeing back interested health care gatekeeper function disappeared suddenly even managed care subscribers could directly seek consultations referrals interested patient centered care managed care industry basically determined market failed theory thought leaders managing populations rather treating individual people physicians always taught patient care highly individualized question continue let government business entities non evidence based practices masquerade quality looking quality physician commentary media journals blogs hopeful clear physicians would prefer blame one one another rather look true problems health care system bureaucrats businessmen calling quality george dawson md dfapa samhsa national behavioral health quality framework nbhqf
