recent incident see link within article occurred minnesota hospital weeks ago resulted serious injuries nursing staff various sites internet view videotapes obtained hospital security cameras shows control man chasing striking nursing staff metal bar pipe cases repeatedly patient case eventually apprehended outside hospital died suddenly tasered taken ground handcuffed preliminary information suggested patient involved situation probably experiencing acute change conscious state total departure personality previous episodes aggression violence nursing staff sustained serious injuries including pneumothorax autopsy results released time many people shocked activity yet fairly common occurrence people may expect kind agitated aggressive behavior occur psychiatric units reality happens psychiatric units psychiatric units managed limit admission patients high potential violence happens medical surgical units number reasons effects dangerous times availability objects used weapons i seen stands used hanging intravenous solutions swung wide circle intensive care unit stands heavy bases inflict serious injuries destroy lot equipment icu many possible reasons kind aggressive behavior ranging delirium psychosis one end spectrum antisocial behavior wanting intimidate medical staff although seems incongruent controlled hospital environment many families experience family member suddenly loses control proscription aggression violence moral interpretation behavior often makes difficult families comprehend happening families medical professionals alike often lack vocabulary describing behavior lump together bad behavior i saw preliminary description incident video clips decided comment results autopsy investigation known idea problem would approached making behavior illegal made me change mind couple reasons first high probability behavior precipitated medical problem led change consciousness point individual control behavior anyone delirious experienced one point another family one male relatives well driller apparently blown well one day resulting brain injury led permanent extreme changes behavior day extremely aggressive aggression directed toward property continuously overturned furniture smashed dishes entire house trashed days care containment available expectation family would care died home environment constantly disrupted rage attacks day capacity inpatient psychiatrist i would routinely see people brought hospital suddenly became aggressive home relatives arrived always shocked find patient admitted psychiatric unit second reason concern involvement politicians misunderstood medical problem acute medical problem causing aggressive behavior criminal medical problem attempting incarcerate fine person aggression occurs circumstance make sense may way secure political capital special interest groups criminalizing medical problem reasonable approach even suggesting something debated court law questionable i base known track record guilty reason mental illness defense widely known low probability defense succeeding also widely known people committed criminal acts clearly severe mental illness typically convicted usually takes expert testimony suggesting despite mental illness diagnosis defendant appeared taking planned steps achieve goal case aggression steps would involve assaultive behavior destruction property rather random activity i say every case aggressive behavior i witnessed hospital even cases patient subsequent recall incident behavior appeared planned assaults directed non medical side spectrum people whose conscious state altered directed violence part personality structure threatening assaulting people way life frequently criminal backgrounds arrest record often give history fighting may harmed someone defenseless felt remorse aggressive behavior resulted injury disability experience majority persons control medical settings exceptions drug alcohol intoxication state makes unpredictable seeking prescriptions controlled substances like opiates stimulants also create confrontations get prescription seeking may question whether special legislature penalizing essentially criminal assaultive behavior would useful guess would reason civil commitments fail work laws utilized hospital administrators courts tend ignore aggression toward medical nursing staff patients willfully directing violence toward product usual conscious state administrators always explained me occupational hazard especially part nursing staff casual attitude often leads inadequate safeguards every step zero tolerance attitude personality disordered violence include prosecutions assault key protecting medical surgical staff patients aggression associated acute changes consciousness heightened level awareness patient history prior admission critical prompt recognition delirium many causes acute drug alcohol intoxication withdrawal states necessary adequate staffing critical needs definite team approach staff unit need aware potential violence priority needs protecting nursing staff delivering direct care patient medical staff nursing page factors present lead split treatment enlightened administrators may helpful preventing dynamic experience i found one common problems staffing cases involves observation preferably trained psychiatric technician nursing assistant knows help patients de escalate reassuring person room often effect protocols address physical environment reduce likelihood post operative delirium necessary useful experienced staff treat acute agitation hospital settings medications large hospitals psychiatric consultation address problem cases patient medically stable transfer secure psychiatric environment assessment treatment medical nursing staff need close contact order make rapid adjustments treatment plan making aggressive behavior associated explainable medical problems crime wrong approach i see legislators talking medical professionals know containing violence aggression typical response cringe i put long list things legislators think needed train physicians like prescribe opiates year prescribe many opiates year plenty people come training known assess treat aggression called psychiatrists psychiatric nurses george dawson md dfapa
