three levels consciousness understand possible trace causes lifelong illness cure beginning person life i must explain view three levels consciousness basically three brains one maclean already proposed brainstem limbic system neocortex representing different stages evolution shark chimp human brain respectively neurologic stages brain growth correspond three distinct levels consciousness earliest pre verbal stage infancy followed childhood finally present day awareness level brain development specific needs must fulfilled uniquely earlier needs lasting consequences fulfilled grave imprint infancy need touched nurtured tenderly second line seek fulfillment emotional needs listened feel secure supported get empathetic response hurts fears third level involves intellectual stimulation communication understanding parents fulfillment level lead clear logical thinking accuracy perceptions first line brainstem first level brainstem primitive reptilian brain oldest brain system maclean brainstem first evolve first part central nervous system develop human evolution seems never lost part added new brain tissue top brainstem deals instincts basic needs survival functions sleep basic processes keep alive body temperature blood pressure heart rate deep breathing level store carrying mother depression anxiety stress drug taking smoking drinking mother also communicate changing hormones unconscious rejection coming baby becomes stored baby brainstem experience stored ideas obviously since yet neocortex thinking intellectual comprehending mind important imprints storehouse later motivate certain thoughts aberrations thinking brainstem imprints deepest levels pain developed gestation handles life death matters see light day second line limbic feeling system second level consciousness basically limbic system brain affiliates responsible feelings memory maclean provides images artistic output processes certain aspects sexuality partly responsible anger fear limbic system possesses key structures affect brain function hypothalamus thalamus hippocampus guardian emotional memory amygdala hippocampus contains archives early experience particularly trauma also puts damper amygdala activation reactions become danger continually high blood pressure heart rate threaten existence hippocampus high density stress hormone receptors therefore quite sensitive stress context feeling predominantly organized hippocampus gives anchor feelings time place allows connect feelings amygdala one ancient structures brain oldest structure limbic system hub emotional system gateway feelings gives sensation behind feeling later developing hippocampus registers feelings facts early traumatic memory consolidated amygdala luckily going gets rough help manufacture opium hold back pain way helps remain unconscious truly wonder small brain structure knows stop pain release poppy derivative help tells brain structures much release stop hypothalamus works lower structure pituitary govern release key hormones least stress hormones strong emotions hypothalamus organizes response within hypothalamus lie two different kinds nervous systems sympathetic parasympathetic key understanding depression discussed detail thalamus central switchboard brain relaying certain aspects feeling frontal cortex decide feeling powerful felt orders message relayed thus kept awareness thalamus talks straight neurochemical talk language expresses wordlessly yet translate painful messages something understandable frontal cortex pain much message arrives garbled acceptable gates open message clearly understood know feel third line neocortex third line neocortex part brain last evolve one responsible intellectual functioning generating ideas thinking maclean left pre frontal area deals external world helps repress able integrate feelings comes online third year life frontal cortex part feeling system degree gives meaning understanding physiologic emotional reactions neocortex serves portal entry suffering component memory portal operate first door walk toward retracing history understanding pain fulfilled deprived levels deprivation occurs pain lack fulfillment means integrity system threatened pain often accompanied counterpart repression fulfillment serious urgent descend neuraxis i call chain pain indeed biology dictates deep pain elicits strong repression keep pain manageable levels heavy repression first line mean deadness affect lack good interconnection bodily function sex problematic appetite dulled lack energy passion symptoms first line include ulcers colitis breathing problems symptoms higher levels different manifestations inability make decision independent forthright aggressive simply brief overview three levels order better understand origins depression therapy consider ancient brains still active head nature problem becomes clearer three brains work harmony throughout lives get along paramount need clear channels among levels otherwise distortion early trauma however creates lifelong disharmony disconnection among brain levels resulting many forms mental illness essentially neurosis driven lower brain centers trying communicate higher ones unable disconnection occurred disconnection caused imprint early lack love spells hopelessness helplessness goal therapy restore harmony neurologically psychologically consciousness confused awareness means three levels working fluidly
