physicians first experience treatment setting mismatches occur medical students residents ethos medical training fosters attitude put upon trainees partly least history american medicine using trainees particular inexpensive labor admissions training hospitals staffing night long many cases meant long hours minimal staff supervision staff typically would hear late night admissions gave resident team specific parameters call work flow created tension system care depending institution teams could negotiate admissions typical emergency department ed physicians veto power getting people hospital highest risk situation responsible happened discharges ed responsible getting patients ed timely manner led medical surgical teams view admissions pejoratively weak dumps many admissions discharged soon possible partly due circumstances partly self fulfilling prophecy treatment setting mismatches case could occur ed hospital patient need problems bee addressed part years advent hospitalists hospitalists enduring relationship colleagues ed consensus admissions hospitals staffed hospitalists rather trainees mean treatment setting mismatch solved start notice issues involved treatment setting mismatches practicing medicine longer trainee examples illustrate point hospital home year old woman diabetes mellitus type hypertension new onset atrial fibrillation discharged home

catastrophic endings common biases alcohol much problem people chronic mental health medical problems continue plug along minimal assistance error ignore real dangers focused quality care definition solves addresses clear health problems scenarios common dimensions first receiving setting easily exceeded patient medical needs cases receiving setting medical oriented ill equipped address medical problems obvious examples people discharged jail care facilities funded basis provide little medical care scenario man chronic cases acute mental illness sent jail rather hospitalized effective treatment one reasons county jails become largest psychiatric hospitals usa one thing recognize fact another think happening cases hospitals little bed capacity psychiatric patients inadequately funded provide complex care inadequate staffing length stay cases inadequate medical psychiatric coverage point politicians bureaucrats decided align incentives level care would best provided jail second discharge inadequate facilities driven rationing acute care facilities expensive possibly unnecessary facilities determination complicated fact receiving facilities also depleted rationing mechanisms reality american healthcare point almost rationed middleman incentivized make much profit possible rationing great example detoxification drugs alcohol despite fact process potentially life threatening minimum associated high degree distress significant psychiatric morbidity including suicide risk needs properly done order facilitate sobriety people usa admitted appropriate detoxification like people severe mental illnesses mostly sent home facility minimal medical coverage sent home cases person incarcerated often go acute detoxification medical assistance many cases suddenly stop opioids benzodiazepines opioid agonist treatment methadone buprenorphine go severe withdrawal jail third leaving medical facility intensive nursing care like falling cliff lot people transition assurance many people manage care homes used options public health nursing comes mind twenty years ago attending physician could write order public health nurse would see patient home make sure transition occurring properly stay contact patient provide ongoing assistance service eliminated along time ago order reduce costs fourth entire system shadow care evolved make seem like care

sign one options demonstrate compliance makes seem like employer health plan care health larger scope things nothing compared lack care happens scenarios final point made irony spending money health care country world large portion go smoke source smoke huge administrative costs profits rationing health care guise cost effective efficient nothing cost effective efficient rationing poor quality care patients best evidence care transitions resulting treatment setting mismatches george dawson md dfapa
