enigmatic subtle oskari kuusela came talk jowett society week theme explain peculiar feature philosophical statements intention exceptionlness generality philosophical pronouncements typically tend explanation things essence necessarily status statements makes necessity cleverest part oskari talk raising question thereby already pricked philosophical pretension using nothing beyond form enquiry inviting metaphysics answer way accustomed really fearless hardly shirk i remember galen strawson arguing individual consciousness 'pfff factor unique intrinsic unexplainability i asked prepared allow sui generis unanalysability consciousness wittgenstein heidegger say multiform manifestations motor intentionality language relational lives etc principle i asked could appeal decide philosophies right one question go well one supposed ask oskari precisely asking largest possible way question supposed ask metaphysician one answer oskari question understand empirical statements happens case metaphysical statements non contingent nature reality pointed really restates problem giving name perhaps aim delineate essential structure reality la plato forms aristotle form kant transcendental structures husserl pure essences russell logical forms heidegger existentialia well ok know exist sure turn seem explain necessities allegedly found superstructure reality substructure intelligible thought enough give content notion seem explain something something explanation already idea something otherwise one might well say substitute mere variable notion meet 'metaphysical pronouncements truth nothing naming phenomenon still wants explaining 'that sounds like explanation sure thought goes 'but show me simply set words aping empirical generalisation alleged non empirical property justification yet unforthcoming oskari took early wittgenstein failed attempt explicate philosopher might saying saying reality enjoys exceptionalness generality arrive later wittgenstein turnaround short later view statements exceptionlness generality much articulate special mysterious property reality cognising mind express unmysterious property mode representation said wittgenstein logical necessity quite generally logically necessary propositions true virtue correctly articulating structure reality virtue correctly describing structure thought language instead form language example true virtue 'how go language one ways go whether talking conceptual models grammatical rules simple language games necessity invoked internal discourse 'if want count good person must try maximise human happiness utilitarian might say statement concerning nature morality statement intended enjoy exceptionlness generality virtue tracking essential feature morality per se oskari offered given fact utilitarian ethics appears capture understanding means ethical leaving aside matters intention example simply achieve kind descriptive universality descriptive exceptionalness generality proposes better think utilitarian proposition called 'model model good aim maximal happiness model necessity derive accurately depicting mysterious necessity encountered structure moral reality whatever derives fact model providing rule use 'moral exceptionless generality utilitarian claim thereby resolves unproblematic exceptionlessness belonging principles confusion arrived questions concerning 'model amounts confusion later helpfully sorted sebastian gr natural ask model whether accurate correctly model nature moral reality true virtue true ask right back old question trying hard avoid problem arises use word 'model rather perspicuous phrase 'simple object comparison stick latter also get clear point deploying models philosophy propose artificially simple rule use 'moral gain clarity nature actual moral thought comparing contrasting ways moral discourse moral practice tally prototype short point model 'fit reality whatever would mean i come rather provide simple notion feel utterly clear use comparator one hold next actual practice become unclear least say 'well ways actual practice depth complexity ways accord model ways accords contrasts model well interests me morning idea 'fitting reality ask whether model correctly corresponds reality i believe subliming concept 'real i would like say something i mean think task model try correctly represent reality nature cognising mind naturally wonder represents correctly incorrectly misses way model simple representation simple rule representation misses way exceptionless generality enjoys feature something represents rather internal feature rule one may well ask whether concepts moral concepts example conform nature morality whether colour concepts correspond anything real place call 'the world whether 'really animals atoms 'out wherever talk like soon also start talking whether cutting something called 'nature joints start take ways talking seriously yet feel uncomfortable gulf vantage point seems open basic understanding things things really may tempted form idealism 'no might say trying stop rot mindless ensuing narcissism 'that colours animals atoms goodness love forgiveness world function world rather represent matters perhaps even matter represent matters thus debate descends portentousness words 'reality 'world 'out 'nature taken life beyond natural conditions application thus normally take 'nature domain plants animals fungi etc pretending seriously ask whether something called 'nature really contain plants animals fungi etc whether 'projection part nature lost sense meant 'nature already understood terms plants fungi etc similarly word 'real know perfectly well banknotes smiles manet paintings guns gold etc real rather fake pretend forged imitation replicas 'but metaphysical realist says 'i talking i talking whether right thinking really even real guns real smiles real monet paintings real gold reality problem know meant word 'reality wittgenstein put sublimed logic language i taken term 'real outside embedding context application try apply void contexts inviting pretend know ask whether contexts enjoy 'instantiation way concepts endlessly treated judgements i want stress seems me problem best addressed trying stop remove world reality nature bringing closer home giving 'human face idealist conceptualist response still takes seriously underlying problematic ignores way object comparison rule norm kind description anything way i see get metaphysical projects idealism realism going start subliming logic 'real ignoring way term gets content sundry contexts application imagine lord contexts responses questions oskari aligned realism wittgenstein would say 'not empiricism yet realism philosophy hardest thing need clear far metaphysical realism 'realism would take coherent ask whether concepts actually find instantiation 'in reality questioner suggested realism involves reality transcends models something concepts must answer wittgenstein encouraging rather thought realistic pays attention really mean talk say goodness love natural life nothing project supposes makes sense ask whether either concepts models phenomena correspond something called reality la idealist reality mysteriously infused concepts occult penetration nature mental linguistic life instead difference representations simple like grammatical objects comparison complex like rich multiplicity moral life normative structures oskari 'models correspond reality opposed concepts use simple objects comparison purpose becoming clearer actual concepts work noting similarities differences makes difference whether say i meet 'concepts instead phenomena
