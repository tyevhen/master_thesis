yesterday i criticized ray kurzweil prediction made discover article arrival sentient fully conscious machine intelligences i like put flesh ideas i talked earlier criteria kurzweil set sentient machines emotional systems indistinguishable humans i like go ahead assume kind machine kurzweil talking would fears inhibitions hopes dreams beliefs sense aesthetics understanding opinions spiritual concepts subconscious mind ability win chess microtubules appear play key role long term memory i call machine homo complete meaning machine computational capabilities things make human mind human i argued yesterday requires developmental growth process starting infancy homo complete machine would recognizably homo sapiens like lacked childhood words would also need understanding concepts like gender identity social responsibility root socially constructed depend complex history interactions friends parents relatives teachers role models real life tv movies etc successful homo complete machine would cognitive characteristics unrealized potentials humans would ability ideate calculate create worry feel anxiety self esteem issues forget things moody misinterpret things characteristically human way feel guilt understand jealousy hatred top homo complete machine would need subconscious mind ability develop mental illnesses acquire sociopathic thought processes even machine deliberately created preeminently normal fully self actualized intelligence maslow complete sense would still potential becoming depressed intrusive thoughts developing compulsivities experiencing panic attacks acquiring addictions electronic poker perhaps afflictions described diagnostic statistical manual mental disorders emergent nature words born neither would kurzweil machine borne yet could acquire long way realizing silicon kurzweil conveniently makes mention human brain would modeled homo complete machine one presumes views neurons mini electronic devices like elements electrical circuit firing characteristics adequately modeled mathematically would account activities human brain kind computer science neural network scheme peculiarly quaint outlook scheme would model brain well blow doll models human body current mathematical models impressive see example tell whole story also necessary consider following neurotransmitter vesicle release probabilistic possibly non computable beck eccles suggested quantum indeterminacy may involved consciousness likely consciousness occurs primarily dendritic dendritic processing little known except vastly complex synapse synapse processing classical axonal neuron firing primarily supports less automatic non conscious activities substantial recent work shown involvement protein kinases mediating memory see example model realistically would necessary depth understanding underlying enzyme kinetics model brain accurately would require modeling production uptake reuptake metabolic breakdown serotonin dopamine norepinephrine glutamate synaptic substances fully dynamic way accounting possible interactions substances relevant biochemical contexts would also require modeling sodium potassium calcium ion channel dynamics high degree accuracy add effect hormones various parts brain also add intracellular phosphate metabolism phosphates key action protein kinases mentioned involved memory recent work established microtubules responsible maintaining regulating neuronal conformation addition service ion channels synaptic receptors provide neurotransmitter vesicle transport release involved second messenger post synaptic signaling moreover believed affect post synaptic receptor activation according hameroff penrose possible even likely microtubules directly facilitate computation classically quantum coherent superposition see remarkable blog post details kurzweil undoubtedly correct imply know great deal brain function likelihood indeed begin see machines convincingly
