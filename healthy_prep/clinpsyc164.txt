trial recently appeared american journal geriatric psychiatry study claims aripiprazole abilify safe effective treating alzheimer patients presented signs psychosis i demonstrate anyone ounce common sense certainly anyone passed basic statistics course see claims especially claims regarding efficacy bordering hilarious efficacy authors said apripiprazole mg day efficacious safe psychosis associated ad significantly improving psychotic symptoms agitation clinical global impression quickie stats lesson determining statistically significant difference two groups large factor size sample difference statistically significant imply difference actually means anything value large sample size seen present study small effects become statistically significant next let discuss size treatment effects helpful abilify mean change neuopsychiatric inventory nursing home version points mg day abilify group points placebo group knowledge mean change standard deviations groups one easily calculate effect size indicates magnitude treatment effect i people get little better lot better effect size using cohen general guideline small effect less small i guess could call miniscule measures used study neuropsychiatric inventory nursing home version psychosis subscale effect size clinical global impressions severity effect size clinical global impressions improvement effect size brief psychiatric rating scale effect size cohen mansfield agitation inventory effect size matter slice effects small let also common sense test clinical global impressions improvement scale asks one question wording may vary slightly across studies one example rate total improvement whether judgment due entirely drug treatment compared condition admission project much changed current abilify study average advantage people taking abilify mg day versus placebo points seven points rating scale example one point rating scale minimally improved next point moderately improved average patient abilify points closer moderately improved compared minimally improved relative someone placebo say ooooh big deal anyone taken basic course statistics either laughing crying choice point makes particularly egregious first two authors academic researchers absolutely must received lesson dozens times research training pleading ignorance part statistical significance okay maybe smaller point i plug numbers means sd test i find differences labeled statistically significant longer statistically significant yes used different statistic apparently useful i thought i least mention someone chose use different analysis data may turned statistically significant case benefits abilify shown study minimal best safety okay abilify work well least kill right people died across course study including placebo group abilify mg day group cerebrovascular adverse events reported four patients mg abilify group zero people placebo group become nearly essential disclaimer studies days authors write eighteen deaths occurred study none considered related study medication emphasis course study funded bristol myers squibb company independent academic investigators determine drug could caused deaths fox policing henhouse discussion best part article discussion marketing exhibit results placebo controlled fixed dose study indicate aripiprazole impacts beneficially psychotic symptoms institutionalized patients suffering psychosis associated ad first study report improvement primary secondary outcome measures patient population aripiprazole also produced significant improvement aspects psychological behavioral symptoms evident changes secondary outcome scores thus results indicate use aripiprazole alleviate specific symptoms psychosis also reduce overall psychological behavioral burden ad interestingly mg day doses aripiprazole show robust efficacy improve cmai scores baseline endpoint reinforcing evidence atypical antipsychotics efficacious treatment agitation apparently robust efficacy means miniscule impact relative placebo see commentary extremely small extent abilify impacts beneficially upon participants study authors credit mention elderly patients dementia related psychosis treated atypical antipsychotic drugs increased risk death compared placebo right kind like happened study least patients took mg abilify i realize may chance occurrence abilify mg patients died higher rate combine minimal treatment benefit doubling risk death hell would anyone choose prescribe abilify based results study believe couple points study i could prattle i think point made journal policies wander american journal geriatric psychiatry instructions authors see following provide measures effect size liberally give cautions statistical significance doubtful clinical practical significance i done post provide measures effect size since authors provide single measure effect size single one wait paper clearly violates one main principles listed statistic guidelines instructions authors get published good question takes me right back earlier posts peer review experts review papers sometimes slipshod lazy biased incompetent fashion editor even skim manuscript see conformed guidelines journal paper flouts journal policies published paper statements regarding product efficacy far overblown perhaps drug reps disseminating wonderful piece science nationwide even internationally help get patients onto abilify marketing based science physicians see sort ruse laugh reps office briefly scan abstract conclude drug effective whip prescription pads tell me last least i present golden goblet award academic authors study well coauthors bristol myers squibb ability present teeny treatment effects robust get away notable great work deserve good cut however many added bms coffers unneeded prescriptions abilify dementia
