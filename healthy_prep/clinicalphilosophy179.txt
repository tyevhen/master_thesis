john heaton talking cure wittgenstein therapeutic method psychotherapy draft review british wittgenstein society wittgenstein philosophy psychotherapy considering wittgenstein psychotherapy breath first thoughts naturally go wittgenstein use metaphors mental illness therapy treatment characterise intent manner engagement philosophical questions central idea analogy clear thanks fann cavell fischer petermann et al unbeknownst metaphysician held captive picture unconsciously influences thereby distorts thinking consciously attempts articulate resultant perplexities doubts clear questions hope perplexities doubts relieved developing theories explanations answer questions wittgenstein contends much less like scientist providing global foundational knowledge much like neurotic realises obsessional neurotic example struggles habituate underlying anxieties accept losses instead deflected articulated obsessional questions forged intentions underlying anxieties may quelled questions intentions compulsively answered acted questions intentions truthfully articulate underlying anxiety resolution anxiety temporary soon rears head thus obsessional often presents doctor hoping better conclusive answer doubts epistemologist wants better conclusive explanation mind relation external world ontologist wants better account fundamental nature reality metaphysician wants develop comprehensive theory explaining mental events cause bodily movements case wittgensteinian treatment rather trying answer philosophical questions develop secure knowledge unearth clarify undo underlying deflections whether philosophical deflections best grasped i cognitively resulting passively distorting influence thought tacit conceptual metaphors fischer ii psychoanalytically existentially actively unconsciously motivated wish avoid intolerable anxieties cavell still matter debate shared sides however idea well direct interrogation philosophical answers philosophical questions considered backdrop debate john heaton written surprising book rather enter debate pursue distinctly philosophical scholarship sort instead takes back wittgenstein distinctive clarificatory methods psychotherapy form therapy results clearly method heaton espouses gets called talking cure along way provides i found fascinating really rather compelling account emotional disturbance therapeutic resolution provided talking cure somewhat uncharitable less compelling critique psychoanalysis cognitive therapy psychiatry i consider therapy critique turn talking cure heaton vision psychotherapy modelled wittgenstein practice value consist faithfulness wittgenstein philosophy could evidence gathered one evidence vision consists rather capacity make clear clinician already tacitly knows open new insights provide sometimes radically alternative articulation character goals therapy form uncontaminated pre existing theories theorisations phenomenological facts therapeutic interaction misleading analogies unhelpful ideologies i locate pre existing map i might describe heaton unusually tough minded psychodynamically inflected practitioner rogers person centred counselling rather sophisticated exponent hobson meares conversational model transformative power honest thoughtful encounter two people held important rather doctor something applying expert knowledge patient rather continue describe heaton therapeutic method relation therapies terms fidelity wittgenstein philosophical method instructive let speak way reader arrive judgement let first consider heaton characterisation nature origins psychopathology neurosis psychosis writes inability speak experiences traumatic important unspoken victim accordingly able understand reasons unhappiness ix misleading pictures analogies hold thinking cramp stand way recognising extraordinariness ordinary particular pictures fix rooted human way life culture therefore connected desires

accordingly motley techniques practices using pictures analogies metaphors humour develop patient thinking psychotherapist unlike say clinical psychologist styles scientist practitioner applying general scientific knowledge particular case like parrhesiastes ancient greece must possess virtuous knowledge individual personal practical knack acting i let heaton speak regarding talking cure vision therapy i found i said compelling clear me adequately captures entire ground field either extant psychological distress apt psychotherapeutic practice i understand heaton conceives practice better way therapy encouraged cognitive psychoanalytical approaches i shall therefore turn critique alternative theories methods spell misgivings critique psychoanalysis cognitive therapy throughout book heaton contrasts talking cure theories practices psychoanalysis cbt takes therapies task imposing vision mindedness possession inner realm mental entities conception neurosis quasi mechanical disturbance realm version discipline psychopathology causal explanation inner disturbances account therapy theory driven intervention internal world undo disturbances generated question continually recurred me whether primarily therapies heaton criticises taken account mechanistic objectified account mental life whether instead heaton reading idioms therapists deploy theoretical work taken account literalism i read two related aspects heaton work contribute unpersuasiveness critique one eschewal academic methods philosophical psychological literary scholarship another running together despite oft sensitivity precisely distinction matters grammatical empirical several ways non scholarly nature heaton text bonus rather detraction particular makes refreshing directness communication greater expressive force nevertheless also means significant engagement attempts read psychoanalysis wittgenstein together engagement occurred may provided better balance work take example charles elder book grammar unconscious makes way heaton bibliography discussion merit elder curiously disjointed book determination read intension psychoanalytic discourse extension meaning use one might say rather explicit readily criticisable naturalistic scientistic metapsychological self understandings times one may suspect elder overly liberal application principle interpretative charity heaton reading psychoanalytic texts contrast reminds one tendency say physicalists read religious human science texts judged understood according epistemic semantic standards natural physical sciences texts may nevertheless metaphorically extrapolate terms i consider following section first wish document difficulty caused heaton otherwise pleasing scholastic restraint offering unsubstantiated opinion rather hermeneutically empirically evidenced argument regarding clinical practice simply theoretical apparatus psychoanalysis particular psychoanalysts i hopefully thereby avoiding charge hypocrisy

curious psychoanalytic texts presuppose death entity clinical uses concept death drive discussed considerable intra psychoanalytic controversy regarding cogency value idea reviewer hermeneutic deficiencies made uncomfortable reading experience let me clear i sometimes found myself sympathetic points view expressed yet text show me i believe claimed i found myself thinking i started different point view i may become rather less reactively entrenched within end book conceptual empirical whilst heaton frequently joins wittgenstein urging distinguish conceptual grammatical empirical orders similar conflation seemed me crop criticises therapists reflective conceptual clarity regarding nature terms criticism theories practice seems suggest tacit philosophical beliefs may underpin underlie hence beliefs confused undermine therapeutic practice thus following differentiating logical propositions ordinary empirical ones vital psychotherapy often confused thus psychoanalysts cbt practitioners assume uniformity propositions scientism psychologism lead reality described science true reality priori structure world science describes specific features person language must reduced neutral descriptive language science thus expressions love may reduced attachment sexual instinct lend easily empirical explanations confusion concepts objects endemic psychoanalysis cbt neurosis perhaps clearly seen notions internal world containing internal objects thinking occurs heads brain alternative suggestion psychoanalysts may deploy concepts perfectly good effect tools clinical work organise intuitions guide interventions inform discussions colleagues whilst yet often unsurprisingly failing separate philosophical task achieving second order clarity beliefs regarding character

subscription false theory reality nature language games remains obscure dogmatism dialectics throughout book heaton tends deploy various self coined wittgensteinian mantras transparent condensations pr porter arguments wielded alleged tacit conceptual confusions psychoanalysts cognitive therapists i found results strategy mixed times provided helpful shortcut times i left either confused impression best optional interpretation wittgenstein simply foisted onto me recurrent claim confused me idea people explanatorily subsumed within theories example psychoanalysts cognitive therapists

wish make concerns dogmatism heaton tells important difficult task elucidation must avoid dogmatism rarely therapeutic action suggestion several times describes work therapy patient working individual idiosyncratic confusions troubles part riles general theories psychoanalysis cbt sees providing helpful bearings moorings whilst tackle distress individual often functioning dogmatically obscure individuality patient i feel sure every honest clinician could recall examples happening rivals practice troubling heaton book however presentation theme dogmatically non reflexively pursued thus frequently simply told wrong psychoanalysis wrong cbt general failings uses concepts wielded individual theorists particular occasions recedes background wittgenstein urged philosophy pursue process working difficulties careful attention details language used particular instances however wittgenstein ideas regarding philosophical therapy heaton regarding psychological therapy presented purely dogmatic form wittgensteinian mantras intoned lists without explication without hint dialectical handling structure reality understood necessarily mirrored language ground propositions sense intrinsic structure independent reality meaning word something world correlated chapter contains extended discussion differences writing talking constitutes eulogy immediacy particularity speech away abstractions written word curiously chapter presents self conscious reflection fact piece writing freud generalisations criticised heaton general claims appear rather extraordinary every oral utterance unique respect context pronunciation meaning remain unsubjected self reflective criticism conclusion heaton along steve de shazer one small handful psychotherapists developed understanding therapy engagement wittgenstein philosophy enthusiasm inspiration wittgenstein shine throughout text pleasingly theoretical explication talking cure provides significant addition therapy literature use wittgenstein critique psychoanalysis cbt however marred non dialectical dogmatism rather look see psychoanalysts use terms midst clinical practice metaphysical views nature mind meaning foisted onto basis explicit formulations respect heaton falls significantly behind elder work freud field modern psychoanalytic psychotherapy still lacks perspicuous grammatical synopsis wittgenstein course
