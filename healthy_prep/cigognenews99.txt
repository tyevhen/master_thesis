treat really oh yes said behavioral methods alone talking take next easy step say primal therapy adhere closely facts need extrapolate solution sadly giant emotional leap need intellect heavily

unfeeling scientist help avoid truths accept facts lieu truths happened decades scientists pleading behavior cognitive therapy despite truth deeper world must deal facts bad name since freud considered beneath smart people knew dangerous unhealthy oh emotional parents knock feelings become unfeeling objective scientists state fact fact papers never draw logical conclusions means apply facts human life human interaction i already say ayayay using facts obscure truths ayayay
