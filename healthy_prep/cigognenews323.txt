years i discussing limbic fear versus brainstem terror go deeper brain responses become exaggerated mild hopelessness becomes suicidal hopelessness fear becomes terror anger becomes rage responses become primitive emanate brain primitive older pre human deep responses go way back time reigning animal reactions extant brain still alive inside provides responses existed millions years ago respects still alligator shark pity remorse instinct primitive animals pre emotion caring concern existed allow murder also permit panic attacks attacks come ah seem come brain panic life saving rapid ferocious responses meant survival someone overwhelmed brainstem react exactly like alligator kill acting brainstem panic victim feels threatened know afraid believe even afraid sometimes feel like fear unknown feeling seems alien i know afraid whatever lies brainstem oh might rub friend old willie shakespeare noted i graduate school i learned antecedent consequent reactions meant response something caused well rage terror something causes ordinary reactions primitive full meaning term far known meant stay me starts get interesting clear writing three brains head triune brain ignored first one i call first line first line lies primitive reactions trauma birth gestation long intact emotional brain reactions coded stored first line brainstem ancient parts limbic system suffer great trauma early times gating system weakens leaky gates trauma causes use major supplies repressive chemicals serotonin impairs proper functioning repressive gates defense system trauma use serotonin damages parts brain produce well dopamine epinephrine especially true smoking mothers experience less defended arrive age thirty panic attack mystery longer understand provenance comes remote nervous system remote constantly ignored yet responsible much aberrant behavior would dream inside lies primitive instincts surge forth defenses weaken comes terror carrying mother smoked drank effectively killing damaging baby diminished oxygen many configurations conspire inculcate terror baby imprinted sealed primal memory panic attack rage attack must look brain understanding cure brain find causes answers cure involves reliving i explained length books blog articles interested i go i think blog articles ago i discussed make cure comes fascinating part recent research justin feinstein university iowa city nature neuroscience study damaged amygdala hub emotional system normal fear responses oxygen supplies lowered carbon dioxide supplies increased mimicking suffocation increasing acidity blood panic attacks world attacks come certainly usual emotional structures believe includes brainstem lowering oxygen supplies adding carbon dioxide provoked lower structures sense danger reacted appropriately much like happens fetus mother smokes pregnancy produces effects means i writing decades fear terror two different reactions involving different brain structures emanating structures million years apart evolution however emotional reactions similarities allows resonance enough fear travel brain trigger primitive panic terror responses i call first line ordinary fear means life endangering cause come time womb birth experimental patients meant means terror dying feels like sufferer exactly memory dying fear evokes reason reason knowable therefore explains reaction known lead understanding first line cure ignored never cure matter technique use treat interesting suffocation great terror reaction associated oddly panic attack often feeling suffocation catch one breath heart beating fast jump chest breathing problems brainstem originated included medulla brainstem ensemble reactions originating deep later set stage many kinds pulmonary problems asthma shallow breathing malfunctions one part reaction may certain vulnerability suffocation feeling birth mother smoked pregnancy already groundwork suffocation feeling birth becomes compounded anesthesia birth mother background smoking mother must keep mind imprint beginning life affect many parts including constant nightmares one catch one breath nightmare dark room air someone putting pillow head fine treat nightmare even drug medicate medicate imprint remains go causing damage nightmares panic attacks breathing problems pulmonary dysfunction part ensemble gestalt must considered one problem many many problems yes many many symptoms must treated go generating source treated permanently must understand physiology memory comes intact whole panoply feelings often much terror feel integrate needs revisited time patient know comes often first many relivings becomes comprehensible clearly remote experience experienced immediately understood reliving gestational trauma experience long understand experiencing crucial integration non verbal experiences relived experienced terms way integrated nevertheless let me explain times patient remember dog died hit car needed experienced expressed repressed emotional aspect experience pain needs unleashed finally felt preverbal pains need unleashed biologic constraints fully experienced integrated become part essence primal know exactly comes fetus experienced repressed pain needs liberating reiterate established lowered oxygen levels fetus creates panic clear carrying mother smokes damaging baby severely really feel terror i recommend work k anand amniocentesis fetuses found probe invaded fetal space stress hormones rose also grimaced show signs distress felt pain terror successfully treated panic attacks anxiety attacks terror attacks rage address first line mystery belongs ancient brain system ignored long want help danger acting rage help suffer panic must travel millions years phylogenetic history deep brain find answers
