spoiler alert ophthalmology always wins i driving home last friday night several minutes seemed like bug right eye i upper lid lower lid trick couple times work i pulled tried rinse artificial tears change maneuver i started see familiar floaters small black dots visual field right i exact symptoms year ago led diagnosis vitreous detachment retinal problems later night i started see flashing halos upper right visual field i got see optometrist health plan referred immediately vitreous retinal specialist today pm today i laser surgery procedure fix small retinal tear periphery right retina specialist explained pathophysiology rationale expected success rate age dependent liquefaction vitreous humor process pull away retina process benign like me year ago lead traction event retina cause tear main reason laser surgery spot weld tear forming photcoagulation scar laser hits prevent extensive tear could require open surgery eye risk infection vision loss decision laser surgery easy one especially i known many people required variations open surgery i sat ophthalmology exam chair head fixed position video illustrates exact procedure i underwent today laser light green end procedure i completely blind eye minutes transitioned violet vision back normal phenomenon cause saturation photoreceptors laser light procedure i underwent much faster repeated pulses laser i estimate i would say pulses light used specialist kept me posted done done etc also coached me i focused extreme limits visual field i observations ophthalmology orthopedic surgery last year year different first i amazed many vitreous retina specialists exist across country given previous estimate total number ophthalmologists numbers people treat distribution must good across country services certainly demand retinal vitreous disease clearly age related problem people waiting area one person younger me considerably older many get injections slow progression macular degeneration i stranger ophthalmologists i th grade i shot myself eye bb gun appointments every year follow injury also allowed me follow way ophthalmologists practice back everything started visual acuity tests visual fields intracranial pressure tonometry eventually slit lamp approach entire refraction tried get visual acuity good possible proceeded slit lamp exam point started retinal exams using hand held lenses lens conjunction slit lamp ophthalmologist really flying patient able cooperate might possible get done minutes things changed drastically since time i roomed medical assistant recorded history took vital signs room i saw another medical assistant took additional history cursory social family history eye diseases diabetes parents siblings cursory review systems heart attack stroke chest pain today visual acuity visual fields confrontation ocular motility recorded chart slit lamp exam measured intraocular pressure kind digital hand held tonometer i never seen got eyeglass prescription new lenses need refraction room i introduced scribe told me would taking notes specialist set twin displays ehr spread across specialist walked performed indirect ophthalmoscopy slit lamp standing hand held lenses told me i retinal tear discussed surgery scribe reminded needed worded chart going record i electronically signed consent form room i saw person retinal scans blue light finally room laser procedure done significant display efficiency terms division labor sole focus problems related eye social history important case interested marital status offspring occupation really interested review systems detailed review ocular symptoms including history bb gun injury efficiently proceeded laser torn retina minutes mark quoted statistics correct greatly reduce likelihood major retinal tear need open surgery worst case partial complete blindness unfortunately psychiatry nothing like i still i done past years obsessive plus point interview included detailed history medical history review systems social family histories comprehensive customized situation i want vital signs examination i myself clinics i get checklists despite hype collaborative care measurement based psychiatry rating scales poor excuse detailed questions problem people believe actually using quantitative metrics measure care scales fooling order make stunning lack efficiency psychiatric practice workarounds prescribers asking questions making diagnoses collaborative care psychiatrist advising primary care physicians treat patients based rating scale scores questions physicians limiting factor lack value assigned psychiatric evaluation i seen bill laser eye surgery i speculate many times i paid comprehensive evaluation roughly period time took diagnose repair retinal tear division labor ophthalmologist seeing times many patients hour i see me positive aspect clinical psychiatry also downfall psychiatry complicated commoditize get me wrong happens time psychiatrists private practice luxury talking people hour makes patient experiences highly variable find model takes also provides clear cut results ophthalmology clearly able science treatment medicine better precise measurement nothing rating scales i would call precise retina vitreous problems i come another conclusion training geriatric psychiatry designed increase sensitivity ageism biases elderly i plenty training i technically geriatric person myself i speak authority aging inescapable disease i hope someday better solution topic another post george dawson md dfapa
