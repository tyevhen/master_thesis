i opportunity listen friday afternoon public radio first time week i settled habit ago i used take two hours work go skating inpatient psychiatrist i still go back work finish two hours skating time added two hours fridays i opportunity listen science friday host ira flatow i turned week i noticed familiar voice talking one correspondents talked briefly blue brain project blue brain project initiative switzerland investigates use mathematical models look human brain function memory particular generally known computational neuroscience modern day extension blended neuroscience artificial intelligence i mentioned recent post work major implications neuroscience consciousness researchers eventually psychiatrists i outline one recent papers order highlight important one major areas brain science psychiatry poor job area human consciousness psychiatry clinical form seeks describe human behaviors two standard deviations norm across finite number dimensions encompassing mood states cognition intellectual ability psychotic states psychiatry seeks classify states finite changing number descriptors assumes human diagnosticians detect differences based training use criteria objective markers objective markers exist conditions defined measurable medical disorder like bipolar disorder secondary closed head injury ample mri scan evidence brain injury elaborate psychiatric formulations contain discussion subjects personality psychological adaptations psychiatric formulation i aware unique conscious state individual recognized level implicit despite billions unique conscious states psychiatrists able detect treat unique disorders objective tests i certainly believe done i years i also believe missing big part picture avoid discussions unique conscious state
