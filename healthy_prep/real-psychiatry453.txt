asthma annoying sometimes fatal disease i first hand experience i asthma least years like many personal medical afflictions i posted blog initially missed treated according recent studies still common experience i teenager wheezing mowing lawn apparently considered normal reaction i developed systemic reaction right physician office parents taken adjacent room advised apparently head sort psychosomatic reaction psychosomatic reaction responded well epinephrine injections diphenhydramine even i medical school treatment asthma shaky i taking theophylline pills twice day several years patients i began treating exacerbations chronic obstructive pulmonary disease aminophylline drips corticosteroids memorize protocols course know mechanism action invalidated based sunderland nobel prize winning work cyclic amp today theophylline considered tertiary option uncontrolled asthma rather first line treatment fourth year medical student i presented well received seminar slow reacting substance anaphylaxis srs known mixture leukotrienes eventually treatment asthma changed glucocorticoid inhalers became treatment choice primary care physician asthmatic patient knows two asthmatic
