back avshalom caspi published paper science rocked everyone world least psychiatry influence life stress depression moderation polymorphism htt gene i know sound exciting everyone anyone pull graph page seminal caspi work ooh aww fact week article cited articles paper links nature nurture depression one elegant demonstration without ado caspi used subjects lifelong observational study white new zealanders known dunedin multidisciplinary health development study cohort children studied ages subjects could still found age careful observation meant caspi could rely lifelong memories subjects history trauma medical depressive issues extent unreliable also studied data points subject lives members cohort divided three groups based httlpr genotype l l l need scratch head let me explain basically talking serotonin serotonin important neurotransmitter regulating emotional state like neurotransmitter serotonin made one neuron spits synapse neurons serotonin floats second neuron activates receptors first neuron serotonin reuptake transporter sucks serotonin back first neuron recycled used see picture image credit peer reuptake transporter yellow look genes code making transporter gene happens special promoter called httlpr directs much serotonin reuptake transporter make people rhesus monkeys happens two long l l copies promoter higher levels serotonin spinal fluid people monkeys two short copies promoter lower levels serotonin spinal fluid people short long l predictably intermediate got serotonin speaking short end stick l middle l l protective back new zealand found young adults dunedin cohort l l l caspi crew collected information previous depressive episodes suicide attempts previous traumatic events employment financial housing health relationship stressors current psychological state turns look current previous depression suicide attempts link type promoter findings non significant uh oh sounds like big bust type serotonin transporter gene promoter seem matter caspi team ran numbers backwards forwards plugged number stressful life events generated remarkable finding see stressful life events likelihood depressive episode around protective l l version promoter even major stressful events chance depressive episode climbs little short end stick promoter add stress risk developing depression climbs quickly plug severe childhood maltreatment variable folks chance major depressive episode age l l severely maltreated children risk major depressive episode age folks stressful life events accounted cohort cases diagnosed depression cohort found particular genetic lottery tell extent resilient stress less least respect depressive episodes suicide attempts plotting suicide attempts number stressful life events generates similar graph percentages roughly l l l pretty much europe america yearly incidence major depressive disorder right around way learned also trauma changes brain years later endured trauma vulnerable major depressive episode make suicide attempts modulated part many serotonin reuptake transporters trauma change brain genes pretty much set stone moment chromosomes mama meet dada except random mutations however gene expression change throughout life generations happen well part mean word epigenetics lot dna spends life wrapped like candy proteins called histones wrap around dna prevent transcribed rna rna stuff eventually translated proteins histone wrapping entirely necessary cells except sperm eggs dna yet patently obvious skin cell quite different eyeball cell different neuron cells certain dna expressed cells histones highly methylated hang tight dna keep transcribed demethylate histones dna set free expressed practical example certain species rodents called voles species attentive mothers less attentive mothers baby voles raised less attentive mothers seem vulnerable stress later life put less attentive species vole high attentive species mother baby vole grows resilient stress decreased methylation attentive oxytocin gene results genetically inattentive vole becoming like attentive vole y'all remember lamarck right guy postulated giraffe necks got long stretched reach high leaves stretchiness length passed baby giraffes well turns respect lamarck right eat experience cope things affect expression dna lamarck gets last laugh extent want change brown eyes blue wait lamarck get contacts expect kids inherit faux color last come around evolutionary psychiatry gene expression modulated selection pressure thousands thousands human generations live eat sleep like hunter gatherer seems me likely deactivate histones genes survival strength resilience happiness resilient presumably raise little resilient humans take place things change i l l theoretically i deal stress without depressed course many cohort depressive episodes despite stressful life events maintained population despite serving higher risk suicide depression combination stress well likely explanation short allele serotonin reuptake transporter promoter gives sort resistance disease knows mean time i try limit stress eat like hunter gatherer
