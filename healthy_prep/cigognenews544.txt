far i made case long term effects early experience let see exactly happens make know experience womb birth early infancy usually registered low neuraxis i already mentioned know experiences send antennae higher brain system inform higher levels existence first emotional limbic brain adding feeling content higher forward provide ideas beliefs thoughts experience biochemical information represented higher levels energy valence urgency imprint also represented even small banal input top reactions urgency always makes small criticism seem like matter life death lower level probably matter life death hovers conscious awareness waiting triggered especially true leaky gates happens present happens resonates happened back brain connected current behavior connected slop make reactions inordinate i say right brain says i going die intervening i wrong i bad i good unloved i loved i die second line reaction event triggers first line something terrible happening i danger leaky gates resonance reaches quickly levels consciousness first line microseconds level takes specific role feeling lowest level adds oomph energy immediate reaction limbic area adds emotion feeling cortical level adds understanding awareness make complete feeling become intellectuals may lose part feeling component become heavily weighted cortical level three levels become whole organic integrated access instincts feelings ideas evolve drag memories along new level consciousness brings new dimension experience experience aspects experience three different levels feeling experience three levels never enough explain discuss feelings must first feel level left complete feeling primitive level say father carrying mother bitterly arguing deciding separate great impact fetus much offspring stands much greater likelihood become homosexual early life makes happen however experience alone might make overt absent father tyrannical mother one many different family configurations frame reference shapes affliction evolve channels underlying trauma makes manifest certain direction every child divorcing parents pregnancy becomes homosexual groundwork already place soil allow deviation occur one one relationship research shows configuration alone goes long way create homosexuality way many undergo trauma carried become hysterics uncontrolled individuals heavy impulsiveness chronic anxiety happen compounded trauma womb life soon weakens gating system person awash pain need heavy drugs suppress addict someone kind experience without much compounding may gating system works drugs needed clearly rarely one bad experience shapes incest one major exception compounding blame compounding may take place genetic vulnerability previous deleterious experiences render weaker family history migraines force memory circulating blood system produce severe headaches carrying mother drugs may produce child needs drugs anguish consciously anguished first insufficient cortex unable sit still class concentrate studies imprint manifest lower level consciously anguished grows may someone whose mother drugs pregnant abhor disoriented completely beginning many facets need focus generating sources originating causes help explain business informing higher levels lies means higher level deviated react accordingly thus take arguing parents low level anxiety offspring move first feeling centers producing bad dreams effects one emotions newly informed neo cortex provide insight explanation first line imprint cause cortex think differently things see may obvious anyone else child seriously damaged emotionally imprinted memory moves higher interrupts train thought cause unable focus task i want explore happens imprint militates higher levels produces kind behavior symptoms know well i discussed works notion trauma train train events time mother ready give birth actually train ends journey stamped becomes prototype react face emergencies prototype large governed two nervous systems sympathetic parasympathetic first system aggressive rapid reactivity drive second parasympath system rest repose system reflection passivity normally good balance two systems skewed early experience one side parasympath system low blood pressure low body temperature slow heart rate sympath opposite way born cut print aspect governs later behavior parasympathetic system original freeze response foretells lack spontaneity expressiveness cut print shaped already earliest months womb life provide channel behavior thus smoking mother may make newborn overreact anesthetic given make newborn constantly drugged tranquilize taking mother passive lifestyle already vulnerable lack oxygen example ramifications widespread obviously simply birth trauma accounts much later behavior trauma may sit nine months previous deleterious events experiences also shape birth trauma experienced trauma train ends newborn stuck unable get easily may imprint struggle fail syndrome offspring try hard give quickly mother may given heavy anesthetic effect paralyzes baby stops much efforts quickly happens determine quickly one gives stops trying later life struggle succeed inculcate someone learns struggle everything gets struggle becomes watchword life becomes ambitious wanting get ahead let obstacles get way drives struggles takes much works great pressure course pressure function learn wait pressure whip activity things waiting waiter ordering caf getting class assignment time waiting till last possible moment make move feel pressure back
