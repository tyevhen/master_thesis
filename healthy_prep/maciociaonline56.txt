triple burner system waterways view triple burner system waterways found primarily su wen also nan jing point view triple burner fu organ i form remember triple burner activator yuan form i set functions fu organ chapter nan jing describes triple burner avenue water food triple burner avenue water food beginning end upper burner extends heart diaphragm mouth stomach charge receiving discharge treated via tan zhong point ren middle burner located central duct stomach zhongwan extend controls processing water food treated sides umbilicus st lower burner starts upper opening bladder separates clear turbid controls discharge intake acts transmitter treated one inch umbilicus ren ren hence one speaks three burners collects streets qijie st chapter mentions three aspects tripe burner first triple burner avenue water food secondly triple burner beginning end thirdly triple burner three fold division body chapter nan jing clearly relates three burners system food fluid digestion transportation transportation excretion therefore function triple burner would encompass stomach intestines bladder note function triple burner really little triple burner channel arm words stimulate transportation transformation excretion food fluids triple burner channel mostly ren mai points ren shanzhong upper burner ren zhongwan middle burner ren lower burner course points affect digestion function triple burner st tianshu example listed point view triple burner organ transformation fluids food therefore convergence views concept triple burner nei jing nan jing i triple burner organ triple burner function even though starting point two classics different however nei jing emphasizes role triple burner letting function seeing three burners three avenues excretion letting nan jing contrary places emphasis function receiving rotting ripening excretion food fluids seeing digestion process transformation activated yuan intermediary action triple burner chapter su wen describes functions internal organs comparing officials says triple burner official charge ditches means like government official charge irrigation triple burner responsible transformation transportation excretion fluids one important functions triple burner terms used chinese connection triple burner influence body fluids often shu means free flow tong means free passage therefore triple burner like system canals waterways channel irrigation water proper fields ensures body fluids transformed transported excreted properly triple burner function relation body fluids closely dependent function controlling transportation penetration see point described triple burner influences ascending descending entering exiting mechanism coordinated harmonized ascending descending entering exiting organs structures ensures body fluids also ascend descend enter exit proper way places essentially transformation movement fluids depends end result complex process transformation transportation excretion fluids leads formation various body fluids three burners fluids upper burner primarily sweat flows space skin muscles middle burner fluids produced stomach moisten body integrate blood lower burner primarily urine small amount fluids stools i upper burner like mist main physiological process upper burner distribution fluids body space skin muscles lungs form fine vapour aspect lung diffusing function reason upper burner compared mist ling shu chapter says upper burner opens outwards spreads flavours food essences pervades skin fills body moistens skin like mist ii middle burner like maceration chamber main physiological processes middle burner digestion transportation food drink described rotting ripening transportation nourishment extracted food parts body reason middle burner compared maceration chamber bubbling cauldron ling shu chapter says middle burner situated stomach receives expels wastes steams body fluids transforms refined essences food connects upwards lungs iii lower burner like ditch main physiological process lower burner separation essences food clean dirty part excretion dirty part particular lower burner directs separation clean dirty part fluids facilitates excretion urine reason lower burner compared drainage ditch ling shu chapter says food drink first enter stomach waste products go large intestine lower burner oozes downwards secretes fluids transmits bladder clinical application many points stimulate triple burner transformation excretion fluids i list according burner upper burner ren shanzhong lu lieque
