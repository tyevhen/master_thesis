common perception ignorance crowd javascript slow i constantly finding however people hand craft javascript loop say string parsing could using language built string methods always run fast example need trim function remove leading trailing whitespaces user entered text form go web look people scripts see lot things like function trim str var whitespace r f xb xa ua ub var i i str length i whitespace indexofstr charati str str substringi break i str length i i whitespace indexofstr charati str str substring i break return whitespace indexofstr charat str `` i took code verbatim web page author claims ironically incredibly fast routine compare function trima return replace replace testing i found shorter routine faster small strings leading trailing spaces faster strings length ten twenty leading trailing spaces better performance shorter function nothing shorter course everything fact built javascript replace method string pseudoclass implemented runs compiled speed important point interpreters written spidermonkey java rhino built functions ecmascript language implemented browser harness power use built functions language never hand parse strings indexof inside loops etc use native methods run compiled speed walk ride bullet train implications client server web app design quite far reaching using server side javascript server runtimes java based means server side scripts running asymptotically least java speed well written client side javascript runs asymptotically speed therefore script logic move client moved madness waste precious server cycles madness i say
