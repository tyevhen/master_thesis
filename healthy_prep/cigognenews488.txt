anxiety felt person process supposedly reducing pain hilgard wrote maintaining hypnotic analgesia requires effort subject even though knows going successful reducing pain effort accompanied physiological signs anticipatory excitement subject knows must soon fight painful stimulation signs may interpreted form anxiety perhaps deriving latent fear time control may lacking case heart rate blood pressure increase pain reduced hypnotic analgesia felt normally full value italics added neurosis course typical see blood pressure high heart rate chronically high hilgard description illustrates conflict pain repression continually waged every neurotic conflict often results anxiety anxiety global symptom arises primal pain threatens overwhelm inhibition make fully conscious every pre primal state patients enter old feeling considered anxiety state anxiety without repression anxiety sign faltering repression without repression one simply gets terror context patients feel terror ancient context anxiety thus symptom signal anxiety indicates defenses maximum strain signals extra production repressive chemistry system revs quell pain control completely lost anxiety taxing enough suppression even anxious person usually uses self hypnotic techniques order control though may never identify alright worry turn fine take easy calm think positive hypnotic style suggestions often
