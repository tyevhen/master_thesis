exhilarating sense release relaxation calm invaded body i quite sure different chronic aches pains i live much time contrast routine relentless misery welcome calm felt like euphoria moment reminded me night years ago i suddenly plunged crater panic anxiety without knowing one moment i sitting berkeley apartment calmly reading book sophomore without care world next pit opens stomach i engulfed fear dread came nowhere i got went bathroom splashed water face i went kitchen manically dishes stop i thought i went sleep would finally go away i clutched pillow shut eyes tight praying inner monster disappear i woke still i trying find cause cure ever since primal therapy ever gave me answers respite primal therapy works stay i big breakthroughs years clouds part angels sing really feel reborn pain comes back keep muddling problem i big avoider terror kept wraps pain endurable dull constant good enough i focused work family whatever literally years would go without therapy without feeling eventually caught me slowly dragged me mental physical morass i could longer brush saying i fine i feeling horrible times whole felt anguished i sitting house feel pain every pore like wretch i wanted put misery could i feeling miserable life going relatively well body carries pain tension grabs stomach like vice penetrates bones times i one big aching organism i even feel times like acid veins maybe i transfixed images christ cross kid i aware i hurting i mesmerized symbols suffering pure agony despair face much pain i see me year i getting regular sessions primal center santa monica
