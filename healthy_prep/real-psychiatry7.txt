i good fortune work intense medical setting years i responsible medical care patients setting i access excellent specialists fact finest physicians i seen anywhere typically involved i identified medical problem potentially complicated psychiatric care patients cases matter problem usually came question patient really needs medication need continue one significant complications renal failure varying degrees taking lithium patients unit hospitalized stable lithium developing renal failure needed tried another agent cases experienced severe associated complications including delirium either bipolar disorder medications used transition cases needed dialysis renal medicine consultants would advise me lithium dose try receiving hemodialysis experience led me low threshold recognizing acting potential adverse effects lithium early possible various points career question renal failure occurred cohorts lithium due different cause example lithium encyclopedia stated concisely growing number reports morphological functional kidney damage associated lithium use actual incidence lithium nephrotoxicity known researchers believe irreversible damage widespread risk increases length treatment serum lithium level time opinions patients long term lithium maintenance morphological changes functional changes primarily water absorption reduced glomerular filtration rate gfr renal insufficiency favorite renal electrolyte disorders text cited lithium compound caused vasopressin resistant nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ndi recent evidence suggests patients lithium develop progressive decrease gfr typically progress end stage renal disease esrd dialysis cases clearly generalizations usually based low numbers patients identified specific creatinine gfr creatinine mg dl predicted progression esrd patients larger study sweden patients suggested lower threshold study patients lithium years starting dialysis creatinine lower progressive increase baseline suggesting rate change important additional factors use nsaids ace inhibitors like lisinopril well intrinsic kidney diseases factor recent increase studies look side effects lithium one case compare lithium side effects typical mood stabilizers valproate olanzapine questiapine one studies uses descriptive statistics two involve calculations hazard ratios specific risks results fairly uniform conclusions known psychiatry training programs past years articles use kidney disease outcomes quality initiative kdoqi staging chronic kidney disease published range stage egfr ml min stage egfr ml min dialysis purpose papers stage egfr stage previously noted progression occur cases even years lithium stopped interesting three papers probably hayes et al strategy look lithium toxicity context commonly used mood stabilizers valproate olanzapine quetiapine associated toxicities mood stabilizers result table entitled table adverse effects maintenance treatment looks mood stabilizers ckd stage hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism hypercalcemia type diabetes mellitus cardiovascular disease hypertension hepatotoxicity weight gain greater greater hazard ratios care calculated adverse effects using lithium reference number events category relatively low compared total events large clinical sample adverse events described expected estimated rate severe ckd stage person years risk estimated rates stage stage ckd per years risk hepatotoxicity rare sample elevated quetiapine group weight gain significant olanzapine quetiapine valproate relative lithium olanzapine also highest rate new onset hypertension none information deters me offering lithium people i think good candidates rationale lithium life changing medication especially people generally never achieved mood stabilization typical medications prescribed mood disorders days informed consent include potential complication i generally advise people risk ndi varying severity need ongoing testing need avoid additional medications may complicate use lithium finally close self monitoring side effects situation complicate lithium therapy like conditions leading dehydration i add risk mild ckd explain patient means one interesting aspects articles ongoing screening patients lithium therapy varies considerably setting setting national guidelines seem help large scale studies enough discussion work clinical level incorporating red flags research example obviously important know new medications especially aceis nsaids serotonergic medications medications may complicate interpretation lab finding like vitamin calcium supplementation case hypercalcemia also important review systems also important anywhere along spectrum side effects including neurological cognitive gastrointestinal renal symptoms i generally advise patients increasing nocturia polyuria polydipsia associated laboratory finding increases risk irreversible renal changes including low risk progression esrd presence edema may indicate rare onset nephrotic syndrome occur people acute treatment good news even accumulating literature potential complications lithium therapy general ideas psychiatrists although methodology studies varies significantly generally come similar conclusions effect lithium renal function thyroid function calcium metabolism systems require close monitoring assessing patients clinical status lab testing numerous changes clinical status result
