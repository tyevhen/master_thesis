one area big data started pay big dividends genome research begin taste payoff right want come along i show mine genetic data public databases service little desktop microbial genetics amazed one knows ralstonia eutropha eats much produces plastic granules instead say starch fat go figure today experiment going compare genomes two bacteria one know well unless got way much time hands germ already know bordetella whooping cough bug bug heard ralstonia eutropha soil organism amazing ability subsist hydrogen gas nitrate carbon dioxide return produces wicked crazy quantities plastic yes plastic stores carbon polyhydroxybutyrate potentially useful industry ralstonia dna like bordetella fully sequenced go right genomevolution org r ox see i set little experiment press pink generate synmap button page run automatically see image like one hit button every dot dot plot represents match gene bordetella bronchiseptica gene ralstonia eutropha see text discussion happened synmap server instructed go find complete dna sequence ralstonia eutropha strain well complete dna sequence bordetella bronchiseptica strain rb run comparison one happens bordetella single chromosome base pairs whereas hydrogen loving plastic storing friend ralstonia chromosomes totalling base pairs one main chromosome two small auxiliary chromosomes called plasmids every point graph represents match gene bordetella gene ralstonia axis represents locations bordetella genome starting one end going axis plots locations ralstonia genome mapping one genome another tallying significant matches massive number matches well let know usually compare organisms see many dots i chose bordetella ralstonia i knew lot hits based prior experiments way i think microbiologists aware yet bordetella ralstonia extremely closely related new information i sharing one thing get bunch points dot plot really know two organisms related synteny comes synteny degree two chromosomes share blocks order key intuition merely sharing genes enough counts whether matching genes arrangements genome genes z order genome also genes z order say share syntenous triplet genomes degree synteny synmap tool powerful lets find syntenous regions dna tunable go analysis options tab synmap page see set two parameters called maximum distance two matches minimum number aligned pairs url i sent experiment values respectively already dialed means graph plotting every occurrence gene pair matches occurred genes genes apart pretty liberal setting two organisms related expect see lot matches i propose try want setting maximum distance two matches minimum number aligned pairs click generate synmap button refresh graph much stringent requirement tells synmap try find matched genes within given gene region regions genomes plot results gene chunk pretty large syntenous region creature genes begin result hunt super large gene syntenous regions shown first graph red dots represent regions run top axis lower right corner remember axes map directly positions genome diagonal line says near linear mapping syntenous regions one genome second graph shows happens tune dna matching parameters find blocks ordered genes within gene domain looking shorter runs genes instead plentiful time graph looks like 'x bacterial chromosomes lot rearranging one common events symmetric inversion around origin replication terminus replication get enough inversions various sizes end pieces dna used near start chromosome ending near end vice versa repeat intermediate locations well want know ends making pattern dot plot sure read classic paper eisen et al called evidence symmetric chromosomal inversions around replication origin bacteria genome biology research unlocked pdf genomes compared synteny block size synteny block size block size block size max domain size genes block size max domain block size max domain size third fourth graphs series show happens tune match smaller block sizes third graph set maximum distance two matches minimum number aligned pairs produces looks like two really poorly drawn superimposed get permissive synteny matches start see results inversion events makes sense shorter synteny blocks swept successful inversions inversion cuts across large synteny block probably fatal many cases large groups genes need kept together proper gene regulation inversion event cuts critical regulon wrong spot cell might go reproduce keep tuning minimum number aligned pairs downward graphs become cluttered see results many thousands inversion events history chromosomes fourth graph uses values max distance minimum number aligned pairs graph five values finally last graph final graph mostly noise buried noise many faint signals seen twiddling knobs synteny settings i hope bit desktop genomics convinced desktop genomics reached exciting stage indeed i scratched surface tools genomevolution org i also hope i convinced microbial geneticists might reading bordetella ralstonia closely related indeed come news i think reported would think hydrogen loving soil organism would much common throat dwelling pathogen i like say dna lie
