erwin chargaff first notice early watson crick deduced structure dna quantity purines dna equals quantity pyrimidines specifically amount adenine equals amount thymine amount guanine equals amount cytosine observation key establishing structure dna often cited chargaff first parity rule chargaff also made another observation second parity rule namely even within single strand dna amount adenine tends equal amount thymine amount guanine tends equal amount cytosine easy understand first parity rule holds true complementarity dna strands depends pairing pairing pairings give rise rungs dna ladder ensure copying strands occurs total fidelity cell division seem priori reason second parity rule hold true fact often hold true wac aw szybalski noted reported finding imbalances purines pyrimidines bacteriophage dna samples szybalski observed cases protein coding regions dna tend slightly purines pyrimidines one strand slightly pyrimidines purines strand messenger rna ends purine

organisms purine rich coding regions resulting purine rich mrna purine enrichment occurs adenine guanine example clostridium botulinum genome codon analysis reveals relative abundances coding strand intra codon base position analysis reveals purine enrichment far concentrated position one codon positions graphs show purine balance position position basis base codon variation purine pyrimidine ratio happens position codon 'a atg example notice purine pyrimidine ratio position well organisms variation purine loading second position codon carefully controlled notice less scatter graph axis scale different previous graph hence slope quite bit less pronounced looks also notice points plot parity i axis indicating codon position relatively pyrimidine rich third called wobble position codon shows considerable variation values slope curve less previous two graphs position pyrimidine rich two thirds organisms well known gc skew tends exaggerated position codon example overall genome position wise wobble base may surprisingly find purine loading exaggerated position codon position slope purine ratio curve shallower position two base positions position actually purine heavy positions tend net pyrimidine rich fact purine loading primarily localized codon position whereas gc skew exaggerated position might indicate forces responsible purine loading entirely different forces responsible gc skew might forces kinds selection pressure might cause organisms purine load one strand dna one possibility purine loading coding strand strategy protecting weaker vulnerable strand damage mutations cytosine thought particularly vulnerable deamination later substitution thymine repair possible transcription process asymmetric rna polymerase operates one strand dna leaving strand free protective antisense strand dna transcription rna polymerase cloaks antisense strand renders strand less vulnerable deamination events rogue methylations etc transcription taking place entirely different possibility envisioned rna world hypothesis hypothesis genetic material early ancestor organisms single stranded rna since single stranded rna complementary anything need obey
