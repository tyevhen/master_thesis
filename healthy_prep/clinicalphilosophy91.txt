brief clip youtube elderly aaron beck talks historic disillusion psychodynamic psychotherapy says instructive i believe tells poor psychodynamic practice i make claims whether practice norm i think recognise perhaps psychoanalytically minded psychotherapists slipped perhaps even schooled hmm post i want think makes kind psychotherapy poor thing poverty relates something else beck says namely 'this efficient way things patients get better way work connection i wish draw therapy poor therapy working obvious one i gon na write post beck talking i psychodynamic therapy patient would come say 'what mind today would talk keep going kind look themes talk movie seen relationship thoughts driving maybe recent memory say 'well see dissect see little theme theme underdog comes one circumstances really aware patient would say 'you know doctor right hit head i found efficient way things patients get better way intrigued happening laughter satisfying satisfying experience i kind detective showing smart work i thought worked i switched cognitive therapy directive patients started get better much sooner i practical strikes me parodic description therapy i call 'external relation posits presupposes therapeutic method therapeutic outcome patient one thing allegedly saying mind i say 'allegedly beck often acknowledges analytic patients actually following 'fundamental rule psychoanalysis leaving significant background thoughts ones called 'negative automatic thoughts ones unsurprisingly pertained transference unshared therapist encourages continue therapist another thing describes patterns finds patient sundry musings patient agrees finally another thing happens patient get better phenomena say piece one another separate merely causally related logic applying procedure process going well practice going theory suggests result product one could say scenario therapist patient supposedly therapeutic encounter merely externally related one another result depiction therapy technique parlour game i believe facile auto parodic result game naturally enough merely intellectual insight patient deeper emotional difficulties remain beck transition cognitive therapy described several different ways one best i believe terms increased engagement patient seen different ways example describes asking 'a key cognitive therapy question namely `` thinking right

valuable therapy psychodynamic therapy parodied confessed beck see little patient waffles actually sharing transference thoughts despite supposedly following rule say actually mind pivotal case beck provides woman fails share omnipresent worry boring beck therapist encourages waffling sitting back makes theory guided links different things said leading best intellectual insight worst since patient really sharing true preoccupations get insight live connection patient therapist patient says stuff analyst says stuff latter 'interpretations somehow supposed effect psychopathology inspires patient says unsurprisingly beck finds strikes me beck early psychoanalytic work distant push button interpretation bell patient feelings easy see setting pose question 'does pressing button cause
