womb life mystery twins desk scientific paper concerning early life affects adulthood chris murgatroyd dietmar spengler molecular biologists max planck institute germany shown rather conclusively life events induce long lasting changes brain physiology behavior early life stress cause secretion stress hormone cortisol turn weakens ability remember things clearly cope stress scientifically minded article includes detailed explanation long duration effects methylation study mice researchers colleagues found periodic infant mother separation birth major cause anxiety view i noted comes humans earlier separation occurs likely anxiety result shortened life span published results study end rather bleak assessment adverse events early life leave persistent marks specific genes may prime susceptibility neuroendocrine behavioral dysfunction yet evidence early events profound effect later life one behavioral dysfunctions may add commonly diagnosed children nowadays good deal evidence mother hyperactivity frequently result drugs cocaine methamphetamine taken pregnancy leave imprint affects offspring lifetime early exposure enough set child revved jumpy life course may stem drugs saw study holocaust survivors i say better approach understanding treating attention deficit disorder trace origins back womb life well individual ancestral history critical experiences left usual psychotherapy key motivations behave learn make love also plays part whether offspring children sterile also help determine become obese say nothing mental illness period body brain rapidly developing surprise adversity affects much body brain addition altering metabolic function reshaping personality traumatic experiences first years life may weaken disease fighting ability immune system report researchers university wisconsin demonstrated children abusive early life spent time orphanage showed compromised ability defend disease shirtcliff coe pollak even children removed adverse environment damage still apparent scientists point though immune cells ready birth develop become dependable cohesive system depends experience part study investigators used body ability control latent herpes viruses measure immune competence people intact immune system usually keep viruses control neglected unloved thus afflictions herpes virus often lie latent likely activated poor immune control case traumatized patients higher levels herpes antibodies indicating immune systems compromised herpes virus later living stable environment still showed higher levels herpes antibodies little question stress chronic anxiety mother affects baby hpa axis seen thus stress sets stage later anxiety offspring partly accomplished methylation heightens cortisol levels chronically high stress hormones affect many functions later life least thinking memory radtke et al much road may affect development alzheimer parkinson disease important utero trauma sets program adult behavior especially afflictions heroin addiction person trying calm something inside idea exists years later may panic attacks seem come nowhere come somewhere job find ignore early womb life experience never discover origins keep looking current environment answers clear get addicted heavy drugs keep panic attacks happening may imprint involved panic attack addiction drug user found way block addiction may forever mystery comes archaic imprints share common cause sharks anyone find ancient cause way allow patient time therapy descend deep lying imprints organized millions years earlier patients led forced process resonance accomplish i explain fully connection new research traumas get embedded system repeat evolve neurons take part evolve earlier neuronal processes related thus interconnectedness form neuronal circuit different level brain function link yet higher levels i call chain pain start patient current life eventually months descend automatically lower connected levels least year therapy may touch brainstem imprints lies deepest remote memories also devastating terms force imprinted pain later disruptive imprints ineluctably neuronal chain lead patient look mental illness severe physiologic afflictions need focus early memories may lie origins mysterious maladies study twins provides fertile ground demonstrating far reaching impact womb life turn suffer years later one study researchers investigated perplexing case identical twin girls born vastly different physical conditions one girl normal severe birth defects born two vaginas two colons spinal cord split two towards bottom back could twins shared genes different asked author report epigenetic research third factor beyond nature nurture new scientist long known epigenetic marks chemical labels added dna alters activity genes without altering sequence particular stretch dna lots added methyl groups activity nearby genes suppressed team took closer look axin gene blood cells twins sure enough girl split spine unusually high levels methylation causes yet ruled researchers think likely explanation one twin something pushed methylation levels high enough shut gene mystery solved far pushed methylation levels critical threshold one twin ''that million dollar question `` says team member nick martin queensland institute medical research australia another study new york cold spring harbor laboratory private profit research center specializing molecular biology genetics researchers also found great differences methylation patterns even identical twins gordon et al investigators looked umbilicord tissue cord blood placentas newborn twins found differences play important role individual development important conclusion must due events happened womb one twin said senior author dr jeffrey craig australia murdoch childrens research institute press announcement research laboratory although twins share womb happens quite different study published online genome research first time shown environment experienced womb defines newborn epigenetic profile surprise authors believe womb life events may profound effect previously thought claim discovery powerful tool managing future health modifying risk lead author believes modify risk dietary intervention environmental approaches say crucial intervene womb life make salubrious salutary make womb life great place education also reliving adverse womb events reversing deleterious effects pilcher third factor beyond nature nurture new scientist doi cold spring harbor laboratory differences human twins birth highlight importance
