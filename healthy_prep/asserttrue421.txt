one biology big open questions organisms differ much regard relative amounts gc dna think two kinds dna base pairs see diagram less equally abundant organisms dna mostly gc cg pairs organisms rich dna within chromosomes higher organisms find large gc rich regions isochores midst great swaths rich dna dna contains adenine thymine equal amounts guanine cytosine equal amounts usually contain gc pairs pairs equal amounts seem optimum gc ratio gc ratio varies species within species constant two really odd facts work gc content dna varies species varies lot evolution seem trend toward optimum cg ratio kind thing optimum gc ratio dna surely microorganisms would figured instead find huge diversity bacteria every point gc spectrum running gc dna candidatus carsonella ruddii symbiont jumping plant louse anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans cp soil bacterium end spectrum find aerobes anaerobes extremophiles blandophiles pathogens non pathogens generalization make smaller organism genome likely rich low gc genome size correlates loosely gc content smallest bacteria tend rich low gc dna huge diversity gc ratios among bacteria impressive simply represent random walk possibility space dna various points spectrum constitute special niches important advantages advantage could high gc dna high dna subtle clues tell random deviation mean first suppose agree sake argument lateral gene transfer lgt common microbial world point view i happen agree course millions years pieces dna kinds high gc low gc flying back forth lgt force regression mean make genomes tend toward gc ratio clearly happened ordinary mutational pressures beginning fairly well accepted see hershberg petrov evidence mutation universally biased toward bacteria plos genetics full version natural mutation strongly biased direction virtue fact deamination cytosine methylcytosine occurs spontaneously high frequency leads replacement 'c 't hence gc pairs becoming pairs strong natural mutational bias toward says dna creep direction low gc end well gc see see high gc organisms like anaeromyxobacter many others maintain dna unusually high gc content across millions generations even middle road organisms like coli gc content slowly slip direction high low gc clearly something funny going super high gc organism like anaeromyxobacter maintain dna super high gc content constant tug mutations direction must putting significant energy maintaining high gc percentage pay extra maintain high gc cost get paid i think i come possible answer dna replication cost cost figured terms time needed synthesize new copy dna cell division anything favors low replication cost high replication speed favor survival main assumption assumption dna polymerases enzymes involved replication clairvoyant ca know need arises four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates datp dttp dgtp dctp needed given moment elongate new strand dna need arises let say 'a 'a form datp come existing endogenous pool dntps containing four bases datp dttp dgtp dctp whatever concentrations enzyme wait datp needed randomly happens lock active site odds one four assuming equal concentrations dntps datp coming along exactly right moment odds incorrect dntp either dgtp dttp dctp try fail fit active site first datp comes along imagine dna suppose regulated intracellular metabolism maintain dgtp dctp ratio datp dttp odds good random first hit go simulate various possibilities i wrote software javascript simulates dna replication template dna molecule base pairs length dntp pool size bases software allows set organism genome gc whatever want also set dntp pool relative gc percentage whatever want template dna random string bases total reflecting relative abundances set gc parameter pool dntps set randomized array reflecting abundances set gc parameter way software works read base template fetch base randomly base pool base happens one four called score `` timing parameter continue read another base template base one called put back pool array random location randomly fetch another base pool increment timing parameter fetch timing parameter goes keep fetching throwing back bases proper base comes incrementing time parameter appropriate time parameter keeps track number fetch attempts correct base turns pool shrinks one base words replication consumes pool i said earlier pool contains ten times many bases start dna template pool ends smaller end replication point graph represents average monte carlo runs run representing complete replication bp dna template drawing pool bases blue points runs used dna template containing content red points runs used dna axis represents different base pool compositions see text details click larger image i ran monte carlo simulations dna templates gc contents using base pools set anywhere gc increments results gc gc templates representing high low gc organisms shown graph point graph represents average complete replication runs axis shows average number fetches per dna base low value means fast replication high value means slower dna replication axis shows percentage gc base pool recognition fact relative dntp abundances organism may vary accordance environmental constraints well organism specific homeostatic setpoints maximal replication speed low point curve happens base pool gc percentage displaced direction dna gc gc organism blue data points max replication efficiency comes base pool gc gc organism red points sweet spot base pool gc concentration exactly symmetrical curve i know bear mind monte carlo runs variation expected interesting thing note max replication efficiency organism comes fetches per base pair axis cache thought important minute real jaw dropper happens plot curve template dna gc content graph i shown gc runs black points red blue points exactly graph replication data gc genome black points data point represents average monte carlo runs notice black curve bottoms higher level red blue curves means replication less efficient gc genome notice best replication efficiency comes middle graph big surprise check value fastest dna replication dna template gc requires fetches per base compared best case base fetching efficiency gc gc dnas mean means dna replication best case scenario efficient skewed gc organisms difference goes long way toward explaining gc extremism stable organisms pursue replication efficiency keeping dna biased toward high low gc seem matter consider dynamics atp drawdown energy economy cell revolves around atp energy molecule source adenine goes dna rna one would expect normal endogenous concentrations atp high relative ntps low gc organism also near ideal situation dna replication high base pool puts near max replication speed part curve see blue points sudden drawdown atp cell crisis shifts replication speed right hand part blue curve slowing replication significantly want intracellular symbiont mitochondrion incidentally want stop dividing host cell unable divide energy crisis consider high gc organism red dots hand atp levels high normal metabolism replication efficient could means willing tolerate less efficient replication good times atp draws perhaps nutrients becoming scarce dna replication actually becomes efficient want free living organism wild want able continue replicating dna even atp becomes scarce indeed happens according red data points base pool becomes gc rich replication efficiency increases best efficiency comes base pool around i think simulations meaningful i think help explain dna composition extremism seen
