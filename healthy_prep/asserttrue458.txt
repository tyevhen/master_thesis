number people knowing partner sally schizophrenia suggested look relationship schizophrenia wheat gluten i decided quick survey literature recap i found far wheat bringer disease first know i skeptic whenever somebody tells me wheat gluten evil reason i nod knowingly politely way i nod knowingly politely jehovah witnesses come door i excuse myself one rejoinders listed i also open minded enough plain curious enough look things i dismiss totally turns growing body evidence implicated gliadin family proteins present grains triticum family variety atopic inflammatory disease processes gliadins three main types stimulate production human protein zonulin mediates permeability intestines mechanisms elucidated leaky gut turn known factor autoimmune diseases one researcher puts zonulin pathway deregulated genetically susceptible individuals autoimmune disorders occur see paper pnas well paper examples recent work fast moving area citations go zonulin research direct application diverse ailments diabetes celiac disease multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis reason believe autism schizophrenia may way individuals influenced defects zonulin metabolism example know schizophrenia sufferers increased risk celiac disease indeed study involving schizophrenia patients controls found among schizophrenia patients moderate high levels iga aga compared comparison group df p english translation iga immunoglobulin plays critical role mucosal immunity secreted large amounts intestinal tract normal individuals aga refers gliadin proteins elevated production iga antibodies response gliadin characteristic celiac disease fact gliadin antibody test mainline diagnostic tool detecting condition stand regard wheat schizophrenia study cited subject dohan grasberger relapsed schizophrenics earlier discharge hospital cereal free milk free diet psychiatry jun wo find full pdf online i obtained copy i summarize essence stated abstract routinely treated schizophrenics admission randomly assigned diet free cereal grains milk locked ward discharged hospital twice rapidly control patients assigned high cereal diet wheat gluten secretly added cereal free diet abolished effect previous findings suggest cereal grains may pathogenic hereditarily predisposed schizophrenia celiac disease disorder may genetically related study subjects male veterans coatesville pa veterans administration hospital average age met description schizophrenia original dsm i exactly va hospital using date version dsm i sure dsm ii available time study patients randomly assigned either diet free cereal grains milk products usual milk containing hospital diet experiment made somewhat higher cereal grains spaghetti instead potatoes milk omitted cereal free diet produces relapse celiac patients thus hypothesized may harmful schizophnenics study tracked number patients discharged hospital days period days discharge readiness patients apparently determined review cases staff conference unfortunately vagueness part protocol raise serious questions blinding possible researcher bias indication whether authors paper hand determining discharge readiness another serious weakness study know exactly patients got much medicines authors say chlorpromazine thionidazine frequently administered antischizophrenic medications also learn discussion portion paper patients received cereal free milk free cfmf diet portion stay confined locked ward usually days according authors cfmf group got restricted diet days total going back unrestricted diet i took paper tabular results made graph numbers table graph shows days release bottom percent patients released axis see difference release rates highest first days curves two diet groups start come together data dohan grasberger relapsed schizophrenics earlier discharge hospital cereal free milk free diet psychiatry jun i looked number studies gluten restriction schizophrenia suck one way another whether study design often number study subjects interesting study i found controlled double blind study patients involving use gluten free diet weeks found beneficial changes whole group schizophrenic patients pre trial gluten free period five dimensions pip psychotic patient profile maintained gluten challenge period authors also admitted changes could attributed attention patients received i sure i think last part means study might invalid one studies i looked reported remarkable results basically case study single patient another study lofty title effects gluten schizophrenics reported thirteen schizophrenics given gluten free peanut flour supplementary cookies given virtually identical cookies gluten added tests rating scales ten day study period showed greater improvement receiving gluten free cookies receiving gluten added cookies authors course concluded gluten restriction beneficial completely overlooking fact peanut cookies exactly hypo allergenic recipe considerations aside decide issue complex role gliadins schizophrenia basis people eating cookies i one consider kind study pathetic waste research dollars bottom line research role wheat schizophrenia hardly consider strong studies sloppily designed poorly controlled use ridiculously small numbers study subjects employ crude methods monitoring patient progress etc yet course apply sound statistical methods numbers make look like solid science papers i saw would make good science fair projects laughably poor one respect another hand i ca claim read every single study ever done area perhaps like dig start references mentioned leave comment find something interesting meantime i feel comfortable saying point way early rule role gluten zonulin intestinal permeability etc pathogenesis schizophrenia i remain hopeful good work area come along sooner later eventually see interesting results though science pathetically weak i think dare draw firm conclusions yet
