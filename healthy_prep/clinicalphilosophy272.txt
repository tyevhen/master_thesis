i recently sent cognitive neuropsychologist chris frith latest book making mind subtitled 'how brain creates mental world reading book reminded me another recent work containing controversy daniel dennett peter hacker amongst others neuroscience philosophy brain mind language hacker takes cognitive neuroscientists task 'conceptual confusions regarding terms like 'inner representations 'information 'mental processes like argument trivially choice language rather claims surface clarity presentation obscures deep underlying confusions nature mindedness supposed tacit confusions within cognitive neuroscience hacker claims drive much putatively empirical theorising clear seems need explained quite different neuroscientific work go ahead wrongheaded conflations neurological psychological functions put aside reply dennett suggests hacker fails take note way terms 'internal representation actually used cognitive neuroscientists hacker supposedly committing fallacy accuses cognitivist failing pay attention actual 'grammar terms employed language games cognitive neuroscience attend appearance conceptual confusion whole dissipated i propose use chris frith book test see right debate dennett right plaudit oliver sacks back cover 'chris frith well known extremely clear thinking complex psychological matters point hacker right frith clarity surface illusion masks considerable lack conceptual clarity confusion uncovered would longer find wanting ask answer many questions frith poses i afraid i going spoil story let diagnosis diagnosis fact one undoubtedly owes something dennett although dennett neuroscience philosophy brain mind language rather dennett example consciousness explained sweet dreams philosophical obstacles science consciousness hacker follows frith work fatally compromised tacit conception relation brain self tacitly positions self receiving end putative 'information processing goes brain i say 'tacitly i mean way make kind sense explanatory structures frith mobilises considering presupposing positioning inner self i one moment suppose frith ever says anything sort 'inner self interest me whether even explicitly believes disbelieves 'the self exists whatever believing disbelieving would amount i trying describe explicit theory mind rather describe seems me tacit commitment underlies way develops theories experience accordingly considered kind 'output brain processes tacitly conceived kind delivery 'consciousness consciousness conceived kind inner screen 'mental world 'representations delivered neurological working deliverances senses displayed accordingly said mistaken think direct experience becomes 'external world cognitive neuroscience show book subtitle suggests 'the brain creates mental world concord reality interesting respects inner world 'directly aware frith lets know pp fully aware temptations psychology commit 'homunculus fallacy effect pretty much fallacy dennett refers talks inner 'cartesian theatre homunculus viewer inner goings theatre somewhat bizarrely frith traces fallacy temptation suppose rather brains control actions suggests illusion brains control merely give illusory experience agents right characterisation however basic metaphysical mistake involved making homunculus fallacy difficult find successful analogy understand homunculus fallacy since bound difficulties
