i saw post another blog today thought good title i end pondering idea almost every day medicine days inundated data scientists one hand administrators data scientists tell going revolutionize medicine analysis large data sets theory patterns data detected advanced computational methods gone spreadsheet era seen easy prove almost theory large spreadsheet i skeptical big data dredging data looking patterns writing seem rigorous me strikes me like one popular tv shows agents field solidly connected computer whiz back headquarters capable pulling document floor plan hacking closed circuit tv system order get information needed i think science works way administrative side worst times statistical efforts administrators frequently laughable attempts legitimize next genius idea come pike mistakes healthcare legendary ranging promise electronic health record rvu based management physicians widget producers exhaustively documented numbers i sat meeting one day showed physicians department producing enough cover salary problem nobody done multiplication work rvus appropriate multiplier added different story administrators also tend collect lot numbers think useful analysis without thinking ahead data analysis statistics seem idea basic statistical analysis much less advanced analysis like legitimately analyze data time detect real differences better example state minnesota collecting phq scores time anyone trying treat depression state seem think unconnected collections numbers different points time kind meaning administrators also habit creating studies confirm vision world studies complete proof necessary entire concept managed care rests many studies wisdom side things i think better example colleague i said goodbye today worked me past years internist also addictionologist abam american board addiction medicine certified physician since early days hiv aids epidemic treating patients significant part early practice encyclopedic knowledge care patients evolved well excellent internist interested psychiatry talk psychoanalytic terms also expert lgbt issues speak authority subject i certainly want see go purposes post i think better example wisdom comes medical practice could consulted number complex problems areas expertise provide well thought answer based much information works potential complications physician tell folks want work i think data mining approaches toward areas knowledge i think page document available online looks issue medication interactions psychotropic hiv medications compulsively great document lacks wisdom help pick best therapy manic patient tenofovir granted position thoroughly biased one i make apologies wanting work physicians greatest technical expertise know apply i mean people recite facts even algorithms i mean people know look patient complicated medical situation still come plan action patient must closely monitored also know better nothing difficult skill acquire practically everyone leaves medical school residency strong treatment bias taught aggressive treatments good even cure clinical practice far truth psychiatry example recognize certain biological predispositions clinical patterns boundaries personalities warning signs disaster certain treatments i first started medicine wisdom based model still predominate model clinical settings much less frequent departments looking people fill gaps necessarily want retain want keep numbers also want spending lot time complex cases payment rates rapidly decline shuffling people door administrators start recruiting bodies based revenue models hollywood accounting i hope i always end side wisdom rather heap useless information lot going around days george dawson md dfapa supplementary i going jam section comment emotional moral reasoning view expected backlash rosenbaum articles nejm decided add instead would strained essay interesting fully expected exercise political rhetoric predictably critical articles mischaracterize position ironically least guilty fallacies accuse using one case new fallacy pretty much invented i think instructive note matters logic goes window pathway sound judgment basically involves rallying troops see shout loudest self proclaimed bias part reason i firmly side refrain shouting anyone thinks like me convincing me appearance conflict interest actual conflict interest convincing me free pizza donuts cause me blindly prescribe medication probably i eaten big pharma food since early fact i think plausible thought experiment much cold hard cash would take pay me prescribe drug i ca come figure would absolutely stratospheric compared usual speaker fees people listed sunshine database based fact i work living treat real patients i accountable patients medication produce real results causes many side effects like early experience paroxetine dawson formulary i prescribe course like arguing democrats republicans i know pro appearance coi coi strongly dislike experience way thoughts matter anchored way i practice medicine nature arguing emotional moral reasoning institute medicine iom describes ethical vacuum recent editorials certainly prove thing usual focus debates also leaves big picture many entire university departments math science engineering actively collaborate industries many cases actively invite industry participation order advance fields notion physicians able sacred trust patients would somehow compromised remains implausible me particularly nearly major decisions physicians make country seriously tampered controlled managed care companies pharmaceutical benefit managers nearly years massive conflict interest nobody talks affects healthcare country supplementary graphic top post shutterstock
