possible today high lung cancer rates large part due power suggestion might presence surgeon general warnings pack cigarets actually cause people expect get cancer see expectation fulfilled stronger warnings ugly pictures make problem worse one new fda approved warning labels idea telling smokers get cancer increases odds getting cancer may sound ridiculous nevertheless epidemiological data tell interesting tale interesting point spooky placebos nocebos i need take moment explain idea came bear me i recently happened stumble onto michael specter december new yorker article placebo effect research i told girlfriend sally article sparked animated discussion power suggestion agreed power suggestion real doctor knows true works ways negative suggestion produce negative effects positive

epidemic diseases somatic diseases mental illness sally offered interesting hypothesis involving lung cancer today high rate lung cancer among smokers due part suggestion planted every smoker mind smoking lead inevitably lung cancer i balked idea ca true i said true today lung cancer rates much higher accounted smoking compared years past also find lung cancer rates took announcement surgeon general report smoking see lung cancer rates decoupled smoking rates entirely going smoking goes turns predictions met click enlarge lung cancer death rate men per rate increased per fold increase find similar trend women lung cancer death rate women per per fold increase yet per capita cigaret consumption rose factor two time period recent statistics reported national cancer institute put lung cancer rate men per year per men women per men rate since leveled drifted lower women rate continued soar illustration shows data graphically source publichealth pitt edu docs perkins ppt see slope lung cancer rate curve less constant slope increases dramatically time first surgeon general report lung cancer cigaret smoking following surgeon general report cigaret consumption starts decline rate cancer however continues skyrocket even especially sharp downturn cigaret smoking begins early time delay effect course takes years smoking get lung cancer might expect high cancer rate reflect high cigaret consumption rate numbers still whack cigaret smoking doubled years leading lung cancer hand tripled years leading one could explain kind dose response relationship cancer rates naturally happen increase times rate increase cigaret dose according scientific literature true large danish study found increase cigaret consumption going sticks day causes lung cancer rates increase saturation effect noted many times literature certain number cigarets per day cancer rate longer increases linearly cigaret dose another possible explanation recent runaway increase lung cancer perhaps people simply live long enough come lung cancer truth life expectancy years men women men women statistics show odds lung cancer go factor age age falls far short explaining fold increase lung cancer left dilemma either cigaret smoking mysteriously becoming deadlier much deadlier something smoke contributing runaway lung cancer rate smokers know latest research mystery subject paper david burns colleagues titled lung cancer risk smoking increased last fifty years cancer causes control march authors paper note lung cancer mortality rates substantially higher expected changes smoking behaviors analysis epidemiological data burns et al used risk model took account among things rates smoking initiation prevalence current former smoking distributions duration smoking duration abstinence number cigarettes smoked per day current former smokers duration abstinence former smokers fairly detailed model words find burns paper concluded first apparent rise lung cancer risk smoking real artifact kind authors cite work work others swartz used birth cohort specific smoking prevalence data multi stage carcinogenesis model similar developed whittemore predict overall age adjusted trends lung cancer mortality white males estimated decline rates interval based assumption constant effect time risk model estimated decline contrasts sharply increase observed lung cancer mortality rates interval tolley colleagues used updated set birth cohort smoking prevalence estimates risk model developed peto predict lung cancer death rates time birth cohort estimated overall lung cancer mortality begun decline early white males mid white females observed lung cancer mortality continued rise throughout peaking early white males may recently peaked white females similar approach using risk models developed cps i data birth cohort specific smoking prevalence data national health interview survey nhis demonstrated systematic trend increasing underestimation observed lung cancer mortality rates across birth cohorts advancing calendar year secondly burns et al tried adjust model smoking duration assumptions account epidemiological data failed get good fit data fiddled duration parameters rather cigarets per day parameters contribution cigarettes smoked per day lung cancer risk much smaller contribution duration authors put adjustments duration effect cps i risk equations provide reasonable estimates lung cancer mortality experience elsewhere restate way adjustments healthy population effects potential underestimates contribution duration risk able eliminate either differences estimation accuracy across birth cohorts progressive underestimate observed lung cancer mortality calendar year advances healthy population effects mean effects due overall increasing health population past years better baseline health might make cancer rates appear worse depending expressed graph shows increased lung cancer rates match predictions existing models taken cbsnews htdocs pdf srntposter pdf desperate explain results burns et al end suggesting unspecified changes cigaret design occurring period years blame otherwise inexplicable increase lung cancer rates fail cite evidence connecting particular design change worsening cigaret toxicity sole evidence supposed greater toxicity modern day cigarets comes simply fact fudging model toxicity assumptions gives perfect fit data support hypothesis showing even simple adjustment cps i risk equations increase risk due changes cigarettes adequately predicts observed mortality data course tantamount saying change risk model assume dangerous cigaret design supports idea cigarets dangerous circular logic cigarets really toxic leave leaves mystery lung cancer rates simply outraced ability smoking rates explain one possibility burns group actually right cigaret design features made cigarets dangerous supported literature quite contrary fact single largest toxicologically significant change cigaret design last years addition filters cigarets prior half cigarets sold non filtered sales filtered cigarets skyrocketed following introduction difference toxicity filtered non filtered cigarets turns huge according risks associated smoking cigarettes low machine measured yields tar nicotine national cancer institute smoking tobacco control monograph large case control study demonstrated significantly lower lung cancer odds ratios among filter cigarette smokers shifted filtered cigarettes years prior diagnosis kabat well lifetime filter use stellman et al two reports large multicountry case control study europe also reported reductions lung cancer risk associated lifetime filtered cigarette use lubin et al lubin magnitude effect large almost see bross i gibson r risks lung cancer smokers switch filter cigarettes american journal public health nations health national cancer institute monograph cites studies showing significantly decreased increased cancer risk low tar cigarets ironically chapter monograph discusses results chapter coauthored david burns lead author increasing cancer risk study discussed bottom line design changes almost certainly made cigarets less toxic toxic literature around greater toxicity light cigarets centered recent shift lung cancer cytology squamous cell carcinoma fatal adenocarcinoma evidence connecting light cigarets shift notoriously indirect anecdotal much work needed causal connection definitively said exist light cigarets deadlier cancers factors maybe factors work making cigaret smoking hazardous could factors bear mind rate lung cancer non smokers gone environmental factors affecting populations equally smokers non smokers account increase lung cancer rates among smokers words increased exposure air borne carcinogens via urbanization take one example could explain increase lung cancer past years time america fact become urbanized still left trying explain lung cancer gone non smokers said arguments involving radon asbestos contaminants drinking water etc would affect smokers non smokers equally yet lung cancer rates gone non smokers rule changes cigaret design environmental factors explanations enormous increase lung cancer left burns others put forth absurdly desperate suggestion today smokers draw heavily inhale deeply cigarets pulling smaller smoke particles deeper lungs words smokers getting cancer ever simply sucking harder making sick i starting like sally hypothesis power suggestion acting long period time may predisposing smokers toward cancer every pack cigarets sold contains increasingly grave sounding grave looking warnings power cigarets cause cancer bombarded message smoking leads cancer inevitably leads cancer get cancer get used whatever reason fact become self fulfilling prophecy
