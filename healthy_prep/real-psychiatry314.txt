every i flash back surgical rotation i old county hospital quite run large surgical service comprised mostly people gunshot wounds cancer patients people long term care hospitals mental illness developed acute surgical problems patients gunshot wounds shot police police officers posted outside doors days seemed like lot police officers outside every door quite distance hallway two sets rounds morning surgical procedures another set rounds pm evening rounds always ended fluorescent lights probably long abandoned nurses station particular case rounding senior surgeon junior surgeon senior surgeon demonstrated much knew little residents knew effects importance gastrointestinal tract hormones moments uneasy dead air junior staff asks intern mr calcium level afternoon labs typically run pm days would started see results rounding time attempting answer questions gi hormones conversations went something like staff md mr calcium level afternoon intern i know staff md i expect run service run service know mr calcium level team got quite nervous situations like training medicine puts directly line fire least used days commentary affect like i witnessed day might lead type disciplinary procedure staff physician something could passed credentialing forms haunt physician rest career type pseudoaccountability arranged bean counters essentially manipulate physicians case considered learning experience culturally appropriate case intern question seemed recover things went well another days gone rumor asked another lab value gave answer slightly incorrect physiological difference answers fired making answer keep mind incident occurred time hundreds lab values track technology primitive state relative currently available computers slow getting results took lot longer medical students interns residents write labs cards using whatever shorthand could devise process data memorized difference integrity answer called question assumption either know answer sure say know near misses judgment made something unacceptable years since i seen quite colleagues fall wayside result similar incidents considered errors judgment senior faculty recent times i think tendency lump behavior category senior faculty abusive toward physicians training certainly may true also true draws clear line need physician opposed may done undergraduate major longer make things like used philosophy english literature classes brutally honest know know i think physician alive tell knowing one critical aspects training physician ultimate test whether patient centered whether try protect whether brutally honest even situation may put risk professionally acknowledge mistakes lapses judgment importantly lack knowledge expertise patient safety depends atmosphere also

things i missed business administrator accountability i missed anything please let me know i include i observed health organization hospital ceos typically accountable board directors little physician medical representation often board stacked people rubber stamp ceo wants like web site referred post often aura ceo board visionary like qualities based public relations advertising rather academic work actual results i never really seen administrator visionary knew much medicine certainly read proclamations medicine reformed daily basis many places internet usual argument physician accountability privilege practice medicine therefore regulation physicians needs reduce privacy rights physicians subject much closer regulation professionals would approach apply people actually determine whether patient gets health care medications specific benefit would logic apply people really run health care system
