medical education issue jama came today two articles discussing new improved medical college admission test mcat i read articles reminded me new improved mcat i took back day i applied medical school i think two years new improved version i could tell difference physicians selected basis old version new version versions mcat i sure many professors i identified never taken mcat many trained united states good doctors good doctors idea multiple choice test pick seems likely making accurate diagnoses depression using multiple choice questionnaire time i took exam sorts ideas could select good doctor trend science deemphasized somebody idea well rounded liberal arts education pure science majors might frowned upon biology chemistry major i stand chance phased general knowledge section mcat rumor discriminated students born raised rural areas access museums art theater jack pine savage i like loose definition native natural range pinus banksiana i probably dodged bullet critical thinking emphasized always tests i took gre said thing seemed like critical phase admissions process interview i interviewed cardiologist wanted know i aggressive enough i know meant stammered quite learned i peace corps said anyone sitting bush two years aggressive enough me gave me favorable rating new mcat promises pick doctors future better described product survey shareholders supposed designed test competencies suggested two reports scientific foundations future physicians behavioral social science foundations future physicians current jama article one authors defines signals new mcat sends future medicine summarized table per reference signals sent mcat revision focus foundational competencies required future physicians rather specific undergrad courses candidates must able learn think like scientists behavior interacts biology critical thinking emphasized balanced testing natural sciences social behavioral sciences none ideas seems revolutionary me looking second signal candidates must able learn think like scientists i think better way take senior level chemistry physics course interesting professor me physical chemistry dreaded course chem majors either chem major based whether passed pchem mentally strenuous course i ever taken certainly medical school courses came close i still recall studying thermodynamics learning maxwell gibbs thought things professor even digressed talk long took linus pauling learn thermodynamics i still thermodynamics swirling background whenever i see crystals dissolving solution whenever i bring car battery house warm whenever i thinking complicated pharmacodynamic interactions keep mind time i took mcat science majors favor thinking time would develop critical thinking liberal arts education core science course general chemistry organic chemistry quantitative analysis physics specified unless gauss i think generally involves level advanced training beyond generally rote courses actually happened cohort physicians trained previous iterations mcat i thoroughly biased undergrad training always like hear undergrad chem majors department i previously worked two excellent psychiatrists chem majors every medical surgical speciality excellent physicians even amount humanities courses time i encountered excellent physicians practically every undergraduate major ranging music performance applied mathematics logical conclusion undergraduate medical education system turn reasonably bright group people physicians irrespective undergraduate majors mcat results seems me documents emphasize mcat limiting factor evidence suggest true considered signal signals ones important since formal education physicians began real area physicians produced medical school want physicians think like scientists also logical place happens recalling biochemistry course medical school practically memorization seminar group addition lectures ten expected discuss state art biochemistry experiments time ongoing basis volumes papers assigned emphasizing specific concept know experimental methods limitations also expected subscription new england journal medicine discuss relevant research exams essays experiments methods points apiece get exam pass undercurrent dissatisfaction many typical complaint would go board exams disadvantage memorizing metabolic pathways clinical years formative process seeing identifying professors excellent clinicians scholars scientists kandel sense word needed scholarly well read experts field me engaging process team one two folks senior residents me medical student dynamic learning environment absolutely best way acquire skills attitudes knowledge base requires physician leave me regard messages main article opinion piece i think science aspect mcat overemphasized reason cohen suggests editorial i always believed physicians think like scientists ethically obliged provide scientifically based treatment problem physicians currently practicing unscientific environment scientist would appalled number pseudoscientific guidelines quality markers physicians adhere range purely financially based management decisions negating critical analysis physician may come wringing science medicine direct result political theory funding private businesses ration health care effective way reduce health care inflation certainly i think honest build medicine intellectual endeavor physicians routinely second guessed administrators often business training need tell people truly interested science go science engineering avoid medicine really true interested physicians thinking like scientists cohen editorial two issues i would like comment first describes skills previous generations physicians scant use among use resources parsimoniously member medical specialty viciously rationed past three decades point marginal resources treat ill patients i say time get rid cost effectiveness argument battle cry managed care industry look far nearest emergency department see result pricing largest single economic problem american medicine best way address get prices par efficient health care systems like japan suggest managed care companies owning means production mri scanners cardiology clinics hospitals etc massive conflict interest resulting prices much higher anywhere else world second issue cohen multidisciplinary team concept view physicians need demonstrate antihierarchical teamwork ideal team future eschews individual accountability ability function leader also equally valuable member like areas medicine psychiatric expertise experience area ignored i multidisciplinary team met daily basis years met time dark forces within managed care telling need meet met time wanted meet could put case managers team tell apart expected negative influences managed care teams depend number practical issues including number full time employees present patients admitted discharged family members show years team members present time i present i viewed job communicate happened everyone else practical matter significant cost factor cohen may wish compensate parsimonious use resources defensive medicine entails conclusion i favorable view either articles previously stated reasons best way assure future physicians takes make sure practice environment intellectually professionally stimulating really expect medicine continue attract high quality candidates undergraduate majors practice environment remains stagnant deteriorates ca expect people thinking like scientists managed like production workers people knowledge medicine science best end highly frustrated overtrained professionals worst much wider range skills currently exists field i mean spread applicant qualifications increase brightest people go school get placed outside current managed care environment health care system evolves two tiers care day comes nature scores mcat meaningless george dawson md dfapa cohen jj changes mcat
