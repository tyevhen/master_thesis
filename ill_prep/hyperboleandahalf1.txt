i remember endlessly entertained adventures toys days died repeated violent deaths days traveled space discussed swim lessons i absolutely allowed deep end pool especially since i talented doggy paddler i understand fun me i grew older became harder harder access expansive imaginary space made toys fun i remember looking feeling sort frustrated confused things i played story lines fun meaning disappeared horse big space adventure transformed holding plastic horse air hoping would somehow enjoyable me prehistoric crazy bus death ride smashing toy bus full dinosaurs wall feeling sort bored unfulfilled i could longer connect toys way allowed me participate experience depression feels almost exactly like except everything first though invulnerability accompanied detachment exhilarating least exhilarating something without involving real emotions beginning depression nothing feelings emotional deadening followed welcome relief i always wanted give fuck anything i viewed feelings weakness annoying obstacles quest total power myself i finally feel anymore experiences slowly flattened blended together became obvious huge difference giving fuck able give fuck cognitively might know different things happening feel different leads horrible soul decaying boredom i tried get fun activities left me existentially confused frustrated inability enjoy months oozed i gradually came accept maybe enjoyment thing i got feel anymore i want anyone know though i still sort uncomfortable bored detached i felt around people i still holding hope whole thing would spontaneously work long i could manage alienate anyone everything might okay however i could longer rely genuine emotion generate facial expressions spend every social interaction consciously manipulating face shapes approximately right ones alienating people inevitable everyone noticed weird people still feelings around depressed people try help feelings things go back normal frustrating happen perspective seems like got untapped source happiness within simply lost track could see beautiful things first i try explain really negativity sadness anymore detached meaningless fog ca feel anything anything even things love even fun things horribly bored lonely since lost ability connect things would normally make feel less bored lonely stuck boring lonely meaningless void without anything distract boring lonely meaningless people want help try harder make feel hopeful positive situation explain hoping try less hope centric approach explaining total inability experience joy inevitably sounds kind negative like maybe want depressed positivity starts coming spray giant desperate happiness sprinkler pointed directly face keeps going like weird argument trying convince person far hopeless hope give optimism crusade let go back feeling bored lonely frustrating thing depression always something fight back hope even something nothing ca combat nothing ca fill ca cover pulling meaning everything case hopeful proactive solutions start sound completely insane contrast scope problem would like bunch dead fish one around acknowledge fish dead instead offer help look fish try help figure disappeared problem might even solution necessarily looking solutions maybe looking someone say sorry dead fish wow super dead i still like though i started spending time alone perhaps i lacked emotional depth necessary panic maybe predicament feel dramatic enough make me suspicious i somehow managed convince myself everything still control right i noticed myself wishing nothing loved me i would feel obligated keep existing strange moment realize want alive anymore i feelings i sure i would felt surprised i spent vast majority life actively attempting survive ever since distant single celled ancestor squiggled existence unbroken chain things wanted stick around yet i casually wishing i could stop existing way want leave empty room mute unbearably repetitive noise worst part though worst part deciding keep going i say deciding kill myself worst part i clarify i mean retrospective sense i seems like solid enough decision time felt like i dragging myself miserable endless wasteland far distance i seen promising glimmer slightly less miserable wasteland moment i thought maybe i able stop rest soon i arrived border less miserable wasteland i found i turn around walk back way soon afterward i discovered tactful comfortable way inform people might suicidal definitely way ask help casually i want big deal however alarming subject trying nonchalant makes weird everyone i also extremely ill prepared position comforting people things seemed reassuring time necessarily comforting others i feelings everyone else many felt like front me i really know i agreed see doctor everyone would stop feelings me next weeks haze talking relentlessly hopeful people feelings exist i could prescribed medication might help me every direction bullshit really long time especially absurdity working hard continue something like overwhelming longer takes feel different starts seem like everything might actually hopeless bullshit feelings start return eventually came back arrive symmetrically i able care long time i finally started able care things i hated hatred technically feeling brain latched onto like child learning new word hating everything made positivity hope feel even unpalatable syrupy simplified optimism started feel almost offensive thankfully i rediscovered crying i got sick hating things i call emotion crying sadness really crying sake crying brain partially learned sad took feeling joy ride learned use brakes steer point phase i crying kitchen floor reason common practice bouts floor crying i staring straight ahead nothing particular feeling sort weird myself film tears nothingness i spotted tiny shriveled piece corn refrigerator i claim know happened i saw piece corn something snapped thing twisted permutations logic i understand produced confusing bout uncontrollable debilitating laughter i ever experienced i absolutely idea going brain apparently storing every unfelt scrap happiness last nineteen months impulsively decided unleash would appear vengeance piece corn funniest thing i ever seen i explain anyone funny i even know someone ever asks me exact moment things started feel slightly less shitty instead telling nice heartwarming story support people loved believed me i going tell piece corn i going try explain really funny see way corn sitting floor alone sitting matter i explain i get confused look maybe i try show piece corn see get wo things get even weirder anyway i wanted end hopeful positive note seeing sense hope positivity still shrouded thick layer feeling like hope positivity bullshit i say nobody guarantee going okay i know comforting anyone else possibility exists piece corn floor somewhere make confused laughing ever depressed even everything still seems like hopeless bullshit maybe pointless bullshit weird bullshit possibly even bullshit i know concerned miserable boring wasteland front might stretch way forever knowing feels strangely hope like
