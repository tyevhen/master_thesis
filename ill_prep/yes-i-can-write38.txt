fully embraced changes internet blogging brought i also talked outdated traditional cv resumes becoming increasingly important building type online portfolio especially showcasing type work fairly easily without type degree diploma experiences starting matter degrees i said later day epiphany came i thought wait second i say i actually believe comes myself last couple years i become expert making myself sound traditionally successful possible i worked catering last year i say i considering going culinary school i tell people i homeschooled try assure i turned perfectly fine i become invested making myself seem normal possible i set part i ended desire privacy i expose life choices judgement near strangers i thought normal sisters i know normal i think pretty cute regardless reason though part me feels ashamed background ashamed i done namely i worked normal job ever ever financially independent ashamed i show myself lead series attempts least try look successful even i
