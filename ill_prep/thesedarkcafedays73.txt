like i mentioned last post i going old stuff i wrote last year darkest days thought i would share song lyrics make song inspired things i learning lewis poetry planet concept metaphor end mostly inspired epic fail crush romance i misread signals never got ground guy seemed me could date group allow entered relationship another chick cue angsty songwriting sessions months living denial still hoping change mind obsessing even though treats like crap even though older talented mature go figure i ca satisfy i ca keep attention eyes shine speak wander talk me i see i hopeless case another pretty enough face god give i long eyes may open blind heart closed truth shouted taking notes i discarded image beautiful star shining unseen corner sun centered world beware first clarity maybe i letting grain universe center world set me fire propel me air i let fireworks i see find new planets place i dance i shine bright i deserve celestial romance r spring read romantic relationships read poetry read loneliness
