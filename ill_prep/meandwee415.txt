sunshine sunshine make me happy skies gray never know dear much i love please take sunshine away times trying hard baby i dream i holding lovely little baby little girl must around months old sitting lap i bbq summer i remember little ponytails hair short little ones i remember feeling warm sun skin top head warm i nestled chin onto head could breathe smell shampoo i felt much love affection moment i felt content world everything perfect i felt love i never felt i woke i lay dark feeling sad i cried felt real gone i never forgot dream i forget feelings i i heard song sunshine today second verse made me take pause reminded me dream night dear i lay sleeping i dreamed i held arms i awoke dear i mistaken i hung head i cried i always sing song paige naps i never made connection second verse today listen song version like i happy little p i think dream i watch sleep heart swells even greater moment paige favorite hippo jammies soon wo fit i document wearing save
