today first day i could wear summer cloths outside still comfortable wonderful bright sunny warm i sat front steps soaking sun walked park swung i love swinging one things i miss winter time swinging i took walk friends long i got home sun set i watched light fade sadness i glad night time although temperature considerably colder i feeling deep longing heart summer nights sitting around bunch friends past eleven night talking laughing truth dare games dark quiet loud hushing smothered giggles soon parent comes near walking around streets past midnight walking pools light cast streetlamps talking deep profound things lying around people piles lawn staring stars sitting top car middle night listening wind feelings spirits pass trees i ca put words much i love summer nights i know coming soon spring awakens joy me love life i love seeing new life feeling i love summer comes next long hot days spent sunlight shade watching sun set front steps give stored heat day long sun gone followed long nights friends laughter stars house still smells outdoors even though windows closed colder temperatures i love spring i love summer i love life i felt need put joy words least attempt i hope everyone else loving springtime much i i ca help wish wonderful summer nights coming soon peace idzie might also like images spring gratefulness summer rules life good linkwithin
