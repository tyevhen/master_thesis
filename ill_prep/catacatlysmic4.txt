along blog hopefully help me keep track actual blog better i start youtube channel good stuff i link videos blog link blog videos anyway time get back point post microdermals thinking getting microdermal sorry crappy close i crop best advice i give actual piercing healing time two different ways i pierced first ones removal cleaning care i unfortunately pictures i first got microdermal i put pictures i actually see piercing hair way microdermals also referred dermal anchors piercings entrance exit i mean hooks place thus anchor requires one puncture wound nifty part dermal anchors get practically anywhere body near eye clavicle collar bones nape neck hips back wherever else little heart desires i think fabulous piercings high maintenance pretty subtle piercing process relatively fast piercer decides biopsy punch rather use bevel needle create space piercing sit i two microdermals done different piercer experienced methods experienced dermal anchor another way also effective i would love hear short i prefer biopsy punch explain soon i go method i feel quite efficient would i recommend bevel needle wanting anchor first piercing prior piercings experience sharp point hollow needle getting microdermal done way piercer uses bevel needle whole needle create pocket basically skin roughly half bevel used create pocket whole bevel experience piercer create shape dermal anchors look side note i continue places i come across starting use jewelry dermal anchors shaped sides anchor equivalent length instead one short side come attention try help piercings migrating rejecting people skin pocket created piercer work anchor place kind give little twist pops correct position reason i highly recommend biopsy punching opposed method biopsy punching much trauma opinion less likely bruise sensitive skin i feel healing time faster soreness afterwards substantially less i took first dermal due professional reasons i removed myself i recommend removing dermal experience piercings care require receive infection microdermal want removed i highly suggest going original piercer another trained professional remove proper instructions aftercare second one i show selfie i got amazing biopsy punch many months receiving perfectly healed i receive side last moving initial piercing time healing time soreness piercing thousand times faster better easier first biopsy punch know basically hole punch skin dermals since really tiny piercings biopsy punch large question look like i post picture soon i done describing curious like i said hole punch skin instead paper piercer inform questions get big question work way circular bottom tool razor sharp takes little bit effort professional side little twists boom little chunk skin removed time allowing piercer easy access placing dermal anchor fastest part piercing me setting took hair longer piercer set properly usually feeling little click probably feel first piercer dermal said biopsy punches created much open space causing piercing susceptible infection i feel long clean properly fine piercer give specific instructions care follow properly like i said healing time piercing i would say roughly two weeks me i estimate piercings soreness time took crusties go away overall feeling me clean piercing twice day first get dermal done careful wash dry face roughly cleaning makeup girl showering lay side pierced little cleaning sea salt spray tip getting little cup water sea salt running piercing gentle effective way clean piercing get rid crusties form like i said piercer really recommend proper way clean i highly recommend healed clean thoroughly least week dead skin dirt whatever else face buildup around stud stinks like ear cheese clean overall experience dermal anchors i would recommend caring i cared mine best advice i give wanting one whole process pierce time heal time goes biopsy punch hurt bevel opinion one bit i think piercings pain level depends pain tolerance person receiving i rather biopsy punched pain quick simple needle consistently dug face set anchor piercer twist wiggle piercing feel seems like little click letting know piercing place tug skin little me longest part piercing usually take minute migrating rejecting mean sometimes even piercing done correctly body skin accept piercing cause migrate move closer surface skin body rejecting piercing starts happening i highly suggest visit piercer change top jewelry yes tops typically screw anchor replaced new studs recommend part body another part piercing absolutely body rules i think dermals anywhere cute mine wiggles little bit normal safe i problems mine wiggling around unless point anchor inside skin wiggling like loose tooth i would feel worried greatly concerned call tattoo parlor ca bad anymore questions i
