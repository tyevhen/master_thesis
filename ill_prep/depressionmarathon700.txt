i feeling low yet i cry tears go apparently disappeared rest soul deep darkness yet abate fact i darker darkness deeper i feeling sad sad i reached point i feel tearful without energy alone time i numb yet i hurt deep dark ache middle soul heart feels heavy like leaden weight middle chest beat hangs heavy low i numb yet i hurt i numb i ca even cry though body wants stream away tears come tears go tears seem insufficient anyway i crave oblivion drinking drugs food sleep name poison anything drive pain i crave whatever take me scary place oblivion seems way quite awhile since i felt way scared craving oblivion harder harder hang onto temporary nature pain say pass within experiencing despair light end tunnel grown frightfully dim
