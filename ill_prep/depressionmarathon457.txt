really chilly gray i think getting me i saw psychiatrist morning told i okay true i good i bad i okay mood seems holding pattern slightly lower normal holding pattern i guess i match recent weather i gray gray actually quite tiring i tired i lacking motivation spunk i feel like i walking molasses fog i like feeling feeling i usually associate quite low course makes me nervous i hoping passes shoe drops today particularly slow tired day i things i could get sofa day i finally get i took jet walk feeling like i roll i decided run maybe best decision right i barely move run horrible legs dead weight pace slow lungs could seem take enough air i even walk middle mile loop combination low motivation poor physical response much overcome i frustrated i could wait done i sitting sweats barely maintaining upright position ready hit sofa i guess one days one days i periodically experience i live illness depression tomorrow hopefully bring energy relief friends
