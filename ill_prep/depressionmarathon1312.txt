running streets late afternoon i reminded similar runs last christmas thanksgiving days weather perhaps similar i running puck time occasion family holiday memory tripped however run streets eerily quiet despite sunshine time day today i even transported back i ran beautiful easter day miler around charles river boston quiet quiet quiet something serene running sunny quiet city middle day usual raucous activity occurs holidays behind closed doors rather streets despite alone gathering days i found beauty serenity vacated streets i could feel sad pathetic spending holidays alone instead i discovered today single creates unique gift i receive gift empty streets public solitude around me pull families inside close doors i get enjoy city ever like today bright alive yet expansive serene me puck cruising middle street i feeling last three holidays alone may bit enjoyable family laden holidays unfolding behind doors i passed happy easter
