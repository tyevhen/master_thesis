i arisen beautiful fall tuesday morning full time pt worked four ten hour shifts i always looked forward tuesday i rubbed sleep eyes i opened back door allow puck escape wandering sleepily back kitchen i clicked counter top tv i straightened fetching puck rations bottom cabinet something surreal flashed eyes i asked aloud i turned volume good morning america hosts apparently i taken time flip sportscenter yet similarly dumbfounded i stood frozen puck food hand tried figure witnessed horrified new york studio me horrified small midwestern kitchen hungry dog yipping door waited wondered central time replay came clear plane flown directly south tower world trade center live national television horrifying scenes columbine also occurred tuesday flashed brain sirens screams gasps silence followed tv hosts silent without words tears filled eyes i could leave tv i bright sunny serene kitchen holding dog food hands beautiful fall day i witnessing people countries dying right eyes moment i never forget today i flying american flag honor remembrance tens thousands lives needlessly shattered hate join me pray compassion pray tolerance pray peace
