forgot video could add description box long choices make affect rest life well human beings ever growing changing creatures everything affects changes process living however entirely wrong think ca get university easily later life learn things need future actually need know i personally never plan going full time university i like institutionalized classroom setting thought spending four years life setting makes me shudder also life work i wish require university education honestly many many jobs people may wish work need piece paper yes necessary wish become doctor need university i understand however huge amount people graduating college ad university honors yet struggling find job chosen profession struggling make ends meet university degree way guarantee job let alone job like money i would spent university i could instead learn far life get far education actually helps me real world traveling world without even spending money i could apprentice instead take specific classes interest me start business one myriad options also seem think sat way get university true either i mean colleges universities often looked upon community colleges really colleges universities accept portfolio assessments offer conduct tests small fee i know happening canada i even know personal experience contacted university i considered attending add whole one capable decision making thing tell me impossible people travel world live raise children starts businesses work make great art start communities million things young people pretty impressive people incapable making decisions eh terms parents liability i think assume parents would request children teens pay whatever saying i working assumption virtually cases offense would relatively minor i marijuana possession yes parents ultimately responsible however i heard hell lot cases traditionally schooled traditionally parented kids getting serious shit i ever heard unschoolers getting trouble minor i love organic food well family especially mother i working finding good places buying reasonably priced organic foods actually co op type places work sell organic food prices non wealthy actually afford hard likely possibly many places enough searching careful let food go waste yes still fairly expensive difficult task i highly suggest dig around food related section unschooling site sandradodd food find lots first person accounts perhaps actually believe me i say controlling food better i see video i misunderstood responded said high school kids fuck like bunnies instead said would fuck like bunnies allowed co ed sleepovers i couple points add firstly i said video still stands kids need co ed sleepovers sex look statistics back me one secondly i certainly heard sex sleepovers fucking involved

another person right whatever want bodies i consider driving influence infringing peoples rights bodily safety i also consider smoking around people infringing right clean air therefor i said originally still stands want body fuck people bodies wow sounded dirty quite mean way p i already responded pretty thoroughly wealthy comment video however i forgot point homeschooler also need pay

ridiculously expensive school activities family unschoolers ever secondhand books reasonably priced free activities similar things wonderful i pride myself ability find free cheap things actually fun along easy wallet works perfectly plan live simple life living choice small amount money oh tests expensive i know places i plan take unless i find i genuinely need get i want case i study months take damn test done i exactly worried nope decisions irreversible i honestly understand believe perhaps always told i heard stupid statement many god damned times sorry bit reaction lol like i said i heard lot unschooling fine long motivated unschooling works unschool become motivated learning want interests relevant want need learn learning approach individual journey different individual different individual empowered excited life unschooler learn natural eating sleeping breathing i actually throw ever researched case schooling methods look like modern methods couple hundred years old idea real control years old modern humans around years society based hierarchy control relatively recent development species history agricultural revolution years ago humans learned life lesson plan forcing learning say much learn research read tribal peoples every bit much learn simply different things learning unschooling natural approach learning humans hardwired learn need forcing pushing work hard make someone learn else advocate threatening child punishing child sound like good parenting honestly makes me feel sad i certainly make blatant statements like everything i read learned seen backs entirely need guidance need control way life i often heard way life comment people nothing back point point video make strong argument people need control argument i seen makes strong good argument
