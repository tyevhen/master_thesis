obviously whirlwind week americans week ago split two like curtain temple jesus death everyone making really really big deal every single little thing people turned religious fanatics candidate choice decrying would vote someone else unrighteous tone might give away i really sick i downplaying importance dealing difficult issues election brought i certainly want minimize hurt fear many people feel i feel like politics getting way addressing issues healing hurts maybe i biased i hate politics i think divisive tedious helpful maybe i frustrated tendency want defend side i hear one side decry i guess could call playing devil advocate me comes place empathy wanting mess people heads today spent almost entire class period discussing election i got frustrated took me back high school i conservative christian much minority people would live solid blue state pretty secular area assume everyone liberal atheist uncomfortable lonely marginalizing feel like i one believed i even worse people made fun group i belonged generally sometimes made fun me personally belonging group even though i majority opinion class discussion today i could stop thinking i felt high school vocal people attacked side extent anyone side would feel uncomfortable speaking persecution starts i tired people painting trump supporters broad brush strokes listening say i know many people voted trump even family i know reasons voting multi faceted necessarily racism xenophobia calling trump supporters racists fair going help understand happened election better fact i think gave trump power first place group people felt marginalized unheard certain level i relate part group practicing christians constantly mocked media school workplace election driven home me people deserve judged heard individuals tendency hear person part religious group political camp hear mentally ill disabled lgbtq even certain region country certain hobby drive certain car make whole set assumptions sometimes many stereotypes true sometimes jump conclusions rob people voice personality experience rob chance hear person rich tapestry story bring personal level i gone lot different emotions thoughts regarding election last tuesday i initially shocked horrified much like classmates i scared would happen future i frustrated sister tried rationalize election results tell me worth worrying i wore black class tied scarf pussy bow determined look mournful lecture problem professor perhaps sensing heaviness spirits day really really funny class i left smiling soul sunny i want ruin often get feel way part me felt guilty i supposed angry disappointed i right move i realized bad move anything i learned struggling anxiety keep writing history future ca assume worst tomorrow let ruin today i lived much life time stop especially something unpredictable control i ca control donald trump actions i control extent thoughts actions thought i also reminded anew importance showing love others continuing work try make world better i felt guilty hating politics wanting debate ins outs election cycle i think worth least time focus people tasks right front me hurts needs go unmet regardless reelection i guess morning class discussion really underscored me though isolated alienated i feel current state life i feel like i fit kids class make fun jesus talk much better america would socialist nation drop f bomb every sentence i feel even uncomfortable emptying pews family church listening pastor decry support gay marriage fight abortion election make me feel even disillusioned evangelical christian culture i disillusioned frustrated lack love compassion acceptance i saw disgruntled political agenda become part theology upset injustice hate ugliness perpetrated jesus name reflect behavior pharisees decried much savior i heard guy say class like anything jesus said immediate response head probably even know jesus said probably knows christians say portrayed jesus i read jesus words actions i realize far followers today fall ideals love selflessness example reaching misunderstood marginalized displayed many people opinion least i come across christians i know either clinging evangelicalism leaving faith entirely walk line temper two extremes politics deal always seeing side things making difficult feel home either camp ca people moderate things swing extremes i feel like i fit anywhere i never i forgotten somewhat hanging right front face i would say i fit family i longer conservative evangelical i uncomfortable i ca deny especially someone never rebellious know i could go life problems social anxiety anxiety induced insomnia brokenness mental health care system despair never finding man accept understand me irrational judgmental idealistic immature i feel comfortable actually able get know i think i gone long enough i wish could live love instead judgment i sick hate judgment pass whether election season whether republican democrat i wish could respect listen love go beyond politics stories stories people lives loves lessons learned along way i want dedicate life telling stories listening hearts addendum receiving feedback post i wanted clarify i mean invalidate concerns people concerning president elect future country i know many people real valid fears threats concerns surrounding incoming presidency i take lightly heart goes anyone true however i want remind people sides political spectrum mocking hating stereotyping members opposite side creating much problem particular issue concerned change world better worse everyday words actions way treat people i beg considerate way talk talk portray side take time listen argument take time understand point view worried election consider talking counselor already consider know future bring take care today putting worries things might ever happen today make life miserable two things i wanted drive home post i think extreme polarity election wake call nation start listening understanding seeing similarities trying make sense differences gaining broader perspective lot people talk tolerance sometimes tolerance limited certain group people i know many read words think pie sky idealism far hate division arguing really gotten life many minds changed debates many changed patient love personally debates driven me away agreeing point opponent hearing friend patiently explain thoughts subject seeing family member quietly live certain way made me change mind profound ways regardless whether agree disagree post outcome election i wish peace joy upcoming season personal healing difficult situations walked
