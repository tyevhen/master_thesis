i past several nights i spent much last night awake i think mood recovered little bit part brain apparently unaware overdrive worry thoughts negative thoughts future concerns crowded wanting heard unfortunately recently chosen middle night early morning time clamor hate like anything i anything matter much thoughts clamor middle night yet clamor last night different thought thought took turn one making racket one louder last i covered head pillow i rolled side side flipped front back i turned television i turned television bathroom trips routine sleep elusive last daylight thing successfully sent thoughts away i know still like vampires hidden dark recesses mind waiting seems moon shine making boisterous rounds
