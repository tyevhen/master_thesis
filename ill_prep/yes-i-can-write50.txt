i talked socialization unschoolers fair bit kind something i forced address seeing every single school free learner familiar oh frequent concern socialization attempt go post share people whenever pull variant tired old query consider series posts actual risk unschooling unschooling newfangled idea i saw comment today shared post mine i think hits every single socialization concern i drawn list comment start continued compiling complaints un homeschoolers supposed complete lack socialization i seen heard hopefully put misconceptions rest yeah right supposed social benefits gained schools outside schools sadly miss rebuttal missing part learning deal bullies mean girls i like share something i wrote recently response question i never met bully i never met anyone i like i lived entire life surrounded wonderful people flowers cupcakes unicorns please excuse snark i let myself snarky make point strange type questions seem me course i deal bullies people nasty people hurt seek hurt myself others i dealt way people i like strong sense entitlement i known know plenty people i really like nature life school monopoly unpleasant people unfortunately might make things pleasant unschoolers least school hours another term choose call unschooling life learning perfect description seek learn life full challenging people situations people help deal matter education said i think able leave situations groups feel abusive toxic really important unschooling children teens granted freedom expand last part one ever put abusive cruel behaviour others ever lesson toughen asking lest think former two statements vastly different last one i think part pattern excusing violent abusive behaviour everyone matter age right live life free abuse abusive people i wrote back ltimately difficult things impossible entirely sometimes even mostly avoid friend groups fights issues support friend going something really rough relationships end run abusive people sometimes feel deal environment feels really toxic unschooling let avoid worst situations unnecessary ones gives children teens lot freedom adults quit job abusive boss stop going quilting class people keep talking behind peoples backs i think children teens given freedom ca help least bit healthier happier better equipped deal difficulties intentional ways dealing students share beliefs work ethic habits etc world full people like fact world contains much diversity people considering schools age segregated contain students schools district means often student body fairly homogeneous terms socio economic level race even religion true live well might different outside school besides age segregation part certainly wo worse might negative stereotypes extremely conservative far right christian school homers wish keep children away everyone think exactly like reality unschoolers i ever met comes homeschoolers sometimes view accurate though frequently unschoolers world things meeting people means going come across quite people share beliefs work ethics habits part living life good part usually socially awkward i like reach back older post time talking specifically myth social awkwardness among school free learners like skill set social skills differ greatly person person regardless schooling lack thereof people social interaction extremely easy find knowing say say behave around different people second nature others work hard make conscious effort learn socially normal work want easily skills come despite ridiculously large amount anti homeschoolers say make person better worse person simply yet another thing varies vastly individuals also skill set comes easier schooled people unschooled ones i met unschoolers great social ease competence schooled people i say i met unschoolers easy time socially well schooled people great social skills majority people i met fall somewhere matter education beyond someone worth respect shown really depend entirely one thing i think people judged much wider range skills experiences competencies without emphasis socially awkward shame heaped deemed socially incompetent also important note seems disturbingly frequent people neuro divergent neuro atypical learning disabilities mental illnesses disabilities stuck label socially awkward maybe think compassion others flexibility way interact different people friends ever made friends people met school seems like sadly limited pool people befriend i hope instead made friends school yes also dance class martial arts sports teams hiking group meeting friends friends going camp meeting people live locally meeting people visiting somewhere vacation unschoolers make friends ways minus school part possibly plus homeschool coops groups conferences world big place full people school hardly place meet said making friends hard matter education teens i often lonely felt place groups people felt like one understood me sister hand also unschooled made friends wherever went always right thick things sounds kind like difference different kids school teenage years often hard throw social groups often feel toxic struggles mental illness i anxiety issues introversion differing world view many people matter education looks like making good friends probably feel difficult lonely kids school i happy say older teen adult i made quite friends including several close ones finding types groups feel home types people feel really connect i wrote subject post socialization question hits adulthood unschooled identity fitting chance team sports believe me i say i exactly team sports yet even i managed bowling team yeah i know stretching definition team sports ultimate frisbee team school impediment part team sports wish learning respect authority people bring one i kind want tell i think coming wildly different perspectives i sure even go addressing i believe respecting authority i believe asshole me different things first means told second means basing actions morals values treating people respect means polite kind unless someone behavior necessitates less kind less polite response breaking people stuff talking people making space quieter people heard learning aware social privileges carry subtly effect treated learn treat others seeking break inequalities words actions basically whole bunch things neatly fit asshole prefer trying good person respecting authority hand means told regardless whether told line values even basic human decency means letting someone else views supersede feelings best healthiest children taking away peoples power choice starts children small continues schooling everything ask go bathroom learn least memorize things relevance life may even negative people like family i thinking anti queer racist comments teachers policies school dress disproportionately target people specific race women queer youth listen teachers might bullies incredibly choices live day day life i think respect authority good thing teaching children shared experience never i heard adults gone different school go haha remember like sitting class hanging hallways eating cafeteria i mean went school someone else two might reminisce specific people classes events otherwise going school provide much common ground hear people reminisce music listened teens movies watched loop child ridiculous meme years ago comes age peers especially shared culture creates shared experience know else provides shared experiences plain old human existence difficulties joys laugh annoying habits separate family members share talk struggles young adult current economic climate share similar experiences cultural ethnic identity sexual orientation political views geographic locations whole bunch things provide common ground others i say school pretty low list dealing peer pressure another one things i think know people including people might try pressure things exist outside school right i offered drugs numerous occasions life never accepted teen though i may adult shh tell i want make clear i think teens use drugs bad people marijuana particularly dangerous substance whether used teens adults body reacts far worse caffeine strongly alcohol i trying make point unschoolers quite capable making choices face peer pressure anything i think school could help dealing hard face people every single day pushing something feel strong pressure hand see people regularly push things uncomfortable firstly making life freer coercive people really care wants needs secondly going matter much people think want sum people think okay try get others things want sadly part life unschooling provide space support choosing healthier social groups making better choices waiting line i almost hesitate add list i asked people facebook page share concerned concern trolling queries received unschooling homeschooling socialization one person asked children learn stand line i know maybe parents saying hey sweetie got stand back line people got nice push front people also waiting line grocery store waiting line check books library waiting line amusement park ride waiting line get ice cream getting go prom let me get straight unschool spend teenage years learning things fascinate excite spending time pursuits feel meaningful important volunteering working getting sleep lots slow need spending time social situations actually like least decided benefits outweigh negatives generally enjoying daily life could spend years sitting classroom go prom even considered close something would make someone consider school better option also homeschooling groups organize proms unschoolers get party none school question really want school version socialization i read sister one comments sparked post burst frustration ca people see school literally training work force people say things like 'school really academics social aspects i learned work people poorer work ethics me deal people cruel me i life wow good job learned settle shit ivan illich said much thing different wording observed school prepares alienating institutionalization life teaching need taught lesson learned people lose incentive grow independence longer find relatedness attractive close surprises life offers predetermined institutional definition school directly indirectly employs major portion population school either keeps people life makes sure fit institution conclusion unschoolers generally plenty socializing though positive ability make choices much little time spent alone others feels best many concerns others express socialization children outside school completely unfounded however i also think important challenge mindset takes school given norm standard methods judged purpose socialization received school really something want children teens ever heard hidden curriculum commonly accepted schools failing even stated goals people outside school attempting emulate way make sense make choices based wants needs parents family communities especially learners schools would go things i rather unschoolers get socialized instead learned interact range people real world kind polite yet also stand others follow rules guidelines make sense good question seem useless harmful finally i like end words wendy priesnitz life children school public virtually time space adults denied access children find psychological privacy daydreaming labeled inattentive disinterested hand life unschooled children even ones without siblings mixture personal shared time allows get know time learn value yet discriminating time spent others observation thousands home educated children past years suggests another factor outweighs kind peer sibling interaction influence social development feelings security self confidence created children freedom venture sophisticated social situations speed positive self concept nurtured warm loving interaction parents respect children main ingredients child social development even outweigh contribution continued social contact creating child functions well society
