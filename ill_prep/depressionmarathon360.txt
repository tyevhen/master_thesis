yesterday strange day i awoke feeling low i went aa meeting anyway perhaps mistake i felt incredibly alone room full people top i discussion focused i used use alcohol fill emptiness i used feel sobriety filled hole realize i walked building i felt familiarly empty i felt aching hole heart i entered vehicle tears i drove home even though i knew probably going difficult perhaps unsafe alone better decision would turn right instead left drive friend wendy house alas i made decision return home tough ache inside abate hole heart incessant ache usually knock punch whenever i feel yesterday got me moving instead i found music station directtv called reality bites appropriately plays head banging angry music i could turned much louder background i set clean house really cleaned since i first entered hospital almost weeks ago i got done i thought i would take nap cleaning hours combination beautiful sunny weather heart pounding music motivated me put running clothes rather bed clothes i tired mood low motivation actually run even lower door i went anyway i ran miles legs complaining i wanted stop i kept going instead negative depression related thoughts randomly bounced around sick brain i kept running labored breathing breathlessness made me want give i used breathlessness i kept running instead miles i option turning home miles away continuing around small lake initially i turned toward home i changed mind ran around lake instead tired breathless pleased i arrived home miles belt like i said strange day filled wildly divergent feelings variety distracting activities i end driving friend wendy home run brain quickly resumed sickness end aching empty hole filled i grateful
