sometimes i look mirror i know i time death called name i ended life plan i looked red flowed wrist mind shut door decision i died day somehow saw me i sank bathroom floor tick tick tick i moving supposed god done i want me see hands move blood someone else died instead brings me back touches scars saved me said sometimes i look mirror i know i knows me life life part plan i look mirror i see face i stare straight eyes looks right back love grace i longer need disguise i turn mirror i bow head one goes me arms wrap around war torn body says i 'till glory
