bittersweet day today i day i productive i went chilly sunny good seven mile run morning i ran bunch errands got stuff done around house early afternoon i travelled vet clinic picked puck ashes dawn one veterinary assistants retrieved puck ashes me also gave me blanket blanket i puck wrapped died i left wrapped around gone i really care i ever saw i back kind nice i left clinic puck ashes blanket drove home home i opened wooden box puck ashes contained odd i seen ashes i knew expect site puck ashes made me cry i took plastic bag filled ashes box hugged chest i cried i talked boy i cried really hard pull ashes away chest put back box eventually i returned ashes box closed box placed shelf front puck photo i set puck paw print top box i put everything back together shelf i felt peace i laid sofa hugged puck blanket chest fell asleep nice puck home i feel better back together
