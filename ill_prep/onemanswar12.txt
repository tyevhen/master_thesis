i watched foamy white fingers dance across dark green waves beach recently i could think time one thing share one thing control one thing never get back orderly predictable time none predict much toes pressed sand i watched children big grown play surf memories made me smile made me cry flashed racing mind i could see myself sitting sand daughter toddler time building sand castles perfect spot beach smooth place waves slowly run retreat water i could see middle child like sand much sitting chair hours finger mouth soaking never complaining big sit lap probably want anyway i could see baby first time took beach fearlessly crawled far water waves crashing face i scooped arms starts last year elementary school two months time relationship time stormy complicated i resent time i lost much disease things i remember life experiences run together tormenting me i remember precious day i family even recent trip beach blur ways maybe i distracted unexpected work spent much time staring laptop time hard serious mental illness days suffering feel interminable good days fleeting maybe normal i suspect disease caused me miss much life i would every one really bad days back i feeling healthy say live regrets never looking back i know hard me mental illness distorts one thinking i guess makes sense would distort sense time worry time front regret time behind fail appreciate time passing every moment i hope read take whiny discontent juvenile bitterness i write mental illness help me cope give others hope help normal among understand life like inside troubled mind i written partly i longer periods good mental health also i secretly hoping dragon slayed never return i fear speaking name might rouse slumber truth i know dragon somewhere still waiting me might even beyond green waves
