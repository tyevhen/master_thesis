i sit alone christmas morning quiet sunny cold outside sky brilliant blue i sitting front living room window typical spot i compose posts creature stirring upon street i imagine houses neighbors teaming excited revelry house quiet i sipping coffee listening npr thinking i trying focus waking alone i trying avoid thinking puck absence picturing smiling face wagging tail instead tears yet i making concerted effort sad long long time least years since i awoke empty house alone christmas day perhaps i feeling sorry myself looks like revelry still empty gift bags lying floor remnants opening gifts two days ago returned home i know i bothered pick put away yet i lovely weekend particularly close impressed i handling puck death i happy strong arms wrapped around me celebrated birthday quiet happy dinner best friends bill cindy saturday night people restaurant food fantastic lingered conversation long long time i felt surrounded love earlier day i ran miles together i ran another sunday evening left i set run i could bare come home running i went yesterday supposed busy i worked hours nursing home locked flu i rest day myself napping hours else i donned running clothes ran chilly miler sun sank helped i taken leaving radio television i running errands makes coming home bit easier noise house college football tempted me sit solitude run last night instead i gathered myself christmas eve candlelight service local congregation i concerned attending alone i felt need closer god i went anyway expected i cried sang silent night candles aglow tears brief end i felt peace i know puck right hand god bouncing wagging tail i instructed god let tennis ball fly puck would never find finer loyal friend i asked god take care boy meet merry christmas friends though may never meet i humbled opportunity spend day thank support i walk journey side i know i never truly alone i grateful peace special day
