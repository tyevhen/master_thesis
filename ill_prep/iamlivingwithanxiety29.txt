one many things i love recovery taught me i always need express opinion something recovery i often i practice exercising control speech muscles may sound simple nervous people always easy example i recently dinner friends chain restaurant companions said food delicious i found mine wanting yet instead complaining i chose talk something else thereby ruining friends experience making feel guilty selecting restaurant recovery i would felt compelled share opinion meal although would nothing wrong i decided i would find difficult critique restaurant without temper thus i group minded letting friends enjoy dinner without temperamental expression admittedly fairly simple example i found situations exercising control speech muscles valuable boss says something i disagree i anxious something want talk others someone expresses political opinion i opposed situation i decided temperamental outburst would group interest also would lead temperamental reaction i later regret i allowed myself express temper scenarios i would later worry i said something i i made someone angry me i burdening someone problems however recovery training taught me value controlling speech muscles i let temperamental flare quickly rise fall avoiding compulsion say mind mental health better self control
