dark cold i began run oh raining hard rain misting thick rain puck i mile loop woods almost nothing i enjoy watching puck race freely trees obvious joy makes me happy i figured rain would subside time sun came i dropped puck home rained harder i added dry mittens thin gloves warm dry headband soon followed matter miles i soaked rain played me throughout run sometimes rained hard times threatened quit quit never mile fourteen i turned even home i could chuckle running miles alone difficult enough adding cold soaking rain certainly heightened challenge i runner i i reached miles one block home i finished cold hands sloshing shoes soaked clothes i wet bone i bought ice typical post run ice bath i could today warm shower fuzzy sweats inviting i joined puck run nap nice i proud myself good day
