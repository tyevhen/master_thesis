couple teammates i boarded plane i barely slept night i excited race arrived texas i stalwartly ignored heat waves radiating tarmac i deal somehow i thought checked hotel i went little run shake legs immediately upon exiting air conditioned lobby hotel i finally acknowledge reality body opposite good dissipating heat even try like care well comfort less mile run i reduced shambling jog breathing like trying insufflate syrup coffee straw point i began panic little i stumbled back hotel took shower cool shower water lukewarm smelled like siphoned duck pond less refreshing made me smell like swamp monster still soaking wet i lay bed tried eat banana innards groaned like titanic split half somewhere back mind tiny voice began scream gon na die weathering another sleepless night i dragged protesting body bed lobby intent ingesting massive amounts caffeine coffee tasted like made pond water came shower served function aching joints creaky innards aside i felt like i ready take world high point entire trip last moment i felt even vaguely lucid rest day spent waiting agonizing apprehension bloodstream putrid slop stress hormones enraged white blood cells something obviously right i tried blame heat i tried blame nerves immune system assault massive singlehandedly managed shatter dreams dignity one shot hours leading race went pretty much like i mean i sat hotel room myself terrifying delirious stupor i later found result degree fever spite obvious illness perhaps due part delirium i remained steadfastly determined go athletic conquest i come way texas let stupid illness

maintain homeostasis i packed sport bra racing briefs ice cubes i knew i starting line biggest race life melty ice water trickling torso inside legs uniform packed full ice cubes looked like i sort strange disorder made me lumpy caused me continuously pee myself one prouder moments starter gun went i sprinted line rest girls ice jiggling around inside clothes flying briefs onto track take long championship dreams fizzle barely audible whine fuzzy depths consciousness i fell back rest field kept doggedly pursuing quest greatness moment i passed i remember trying punch volunteer dragged me track i completely lost consciousness next hours blur concerned coaches doctors tubes thermometers night i could sleep i afraid i going die alone hotel room i crawled lobby hotel tried sleep one couches logic i started dying maybe someone would notice help me still delirious next morning i woke immediately decided i needed juice anything world i would shanked infant juice reason i thought

across grocery store mile hotel i began notice houses street i walking bars windows bullet holes couple cars parked along street broken glass littered sidewalks i realized i good neighborhood i lost might big deal people weak possibly dying girl spent life woods rural north idaho pretty terrifying i quickened pace really served propel me faster unknown direction amazingly i eventually find grocery store confusing grocery store i ever first signs written spanish i speak little spanish me little good order anything entire store shelves packed various foods toiletries none grouped sort easily recognizable category dry pasta next random shampoo bottles box reese peanut butter cups aisles shampoo accompanied salsa something called energy balls appeared homemade chocolate balls coffee beans stuffed rolled inside plastic sandwich bag birds flew freely throughout store centrally located tank live lobsters made whole place smell like rancid seawater like horrific wonderland confusion i never going find juice i never going able go home i sat middle appeared yellow things aisle began weep quietly eventually kindly man found me asked me wrong spanish i tried explain i lost i really

early flight i get sleep much i woke feeling even worse i day half conscious stupor i remember lurching around airport eyes closed dragging backpack ground trying stay reasonably close teammates voices long layover denver i tried get sleep row seats near terminal airport really quiet early hour terminal right next moving sidewalk loud automated voice emanated roughly every minute annoyingly cheery robotic female voice warning people english spanish moving sidewalk coming end watch step seemed completely unnecessary i think really ended getting me end three days since i gotten measly hours sleep felt like stupid lady robot forcefully robbing me every bit psychological integrity i left hour trying sleep unsuccessfully i finally got try find solution anything i sleep i felt like i
