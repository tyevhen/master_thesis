i wanted write something unschooling i i going publish facebook deviantart well obviously directed straight blog readers particular i love hear feedback might thanks reading i live particularly mainstream lifestyle many may know depending reading i unschool i answered question soooo many times put negative reactions questions i decided write definitive response piece thingy unschooling unschooling means me i also best put rest common annoying objections start i suppose i explain exactly unschooling straightforward i manage version unschooling student directed learning means child teen learns whatever want whenever want learning entirely interest driven dictated directed curriculum teachers parents unschooler life classroom poetic version unschoolers learn watching listening thinking exploring learn long conversations reading books running singing laughing loving unschoolers learn life unschooling me i read read read read i participate super long discussions family friends civilization anarchy government propaganda brain washing psychology education sustainable living dozens topics i write poetry i blog i read people blogs i take pictures everything i debate issues online real life i run sheer joy i explore surroundings i cook includes shopping ingredients i think constantly seems fairly logical me better way learn complete freedom people learn best actually want learn topic school full bullshit anyway thing although virtually anyone talk goes school say tons bullshit tons pointless busywork suggest simply leave react horror virtually every person school least years admit forgotten learned school yet suggest send kids school met horror people see something seriously wrong school system yet still believe attendance absolutely necessary unschooling foreign concept something different norm even i explained i often met blank looks query curriculum i use similar nonsense people actually grasp i trying tell come learn read life best teacher bar none many books much online many museums even last resort tutors access knowledge could easier get university yes absolutely yes even multiple options take high school leaving certificate whatever equivalent certification exists area take sat recognized pretty much everywhere personal favorite get purely portfolio assessment often accompanied interview fails many universities happy conduct equivalency exams important note theoretical i actually know unschoolers graduated university i seen flesh done without much difficulty schooled kids kids learn anything i force oh ridiculous notion people learn forced invented look babies learn crawl talk explore environment constantly suck knowledge like sponge one forces learn anything look young children ask questions constantly curiosity love learning endless well really endless seems sometime shortly enter school dies coincidence much something shoved throat like experience learning aka forced memorize regurgitate facts bad stop wanting anything could blamed i saying everyone loses love learning although probably sounds like lucky tough souls manage keep love alive working odds seem far learn everything need forced i understand bit better many questions people come even i agree i agree naturally learn need instance say passion space want become astronaut therefore follow interest quickly realizing lot science math involved learn however passion poetry writing want go job something literature language really need higher math simply handling finances living life learn basic addition subtraction division etc interest anything requires learn math something else people seem quite grasp self directed learners unschoolers teach think second ever find need know something never learned get something want i university simply learn whatever missing i move onto assumptions i think even worse straight questions assumption unschoolers rich privileged whatever hell means spoiled hell come unschoolers i come across none fit honestly none seemed spoiled really i certainly personally liked every unschooler i met one gets along everyone single one seemed false sense entitlement rich somehow make someone bad person rather judgmental mention fact great majority unschoolers i encountered could probably described lower middle class rich assumption unschoolers end flipping burgers rest lives read answer unschoolers get university also i major problem good job thing exactly good job one makes money well i hate say really money buy happiness everyone knows saying people seem believe good job opinion whatever makes happy could lawyer could also woodcarver circus performer farmer herbalist unschoolers certainly get high paying job wish plenty unschoolers smart enough follow passions always done unschooler actually enjoy life instead slaving away job hate i believe common although quite possible i forgotten one two oh well conclusion unschooling doable absolutely completely totally doable shown thousands unschoolers worldwide movement growing people realizing truly horrible school people realizing school teaches obedience authority compulsory school invented whole purpose seemingly still produce good workers known productive members society people submit authority wage slave jobs best abilities unhindered usually innate human characteristics creativity ingenuity think qualities prized important thing me freedom false freedom governments like preach real honest freedom ability dictate life choose importantly control thoughts mind mind mine i never went school i want things stay way i always want control life i hope appreciate unschooled i love hear anything add go school i hope makes think i really hope i come across disliking go traditional schools since i many friends schooled i hate educational institution i hate passion frustration comes i written directed straight schooling system forced suffer peace idzie
