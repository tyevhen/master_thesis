couple days ago i shared old song lyrics poetry i wrote year half ago i found lyrics couple months ago i thought might worth sharing written i reminiscing reading old diaries capture process grieving moving one recovery memory lane beauty bittersweet pain count crosses mourn losses shed tears lost lonely years ashes ashes dust dust let tears fall turn gold pages rust long someone remembers i long september spent praying let me walking memory lane turning pages bring back pain thinking never kissed me wondering ever miss me i memory odd lovestruck girl laugh memory lane much pain i shut till i came doubt ever happened scenes flow like rapids i look me i memories i put away old pictures till next time i peruse good look back i could really use new memories r ending kind corny i thought capture bit experience recalling past way recovery i found lot pain i sequestered dark part memory sometimes seems right take old memories back remind really struggle event made blew head old self deserves recognized endured bravely read poetry i written tough times listen music
