sometimes i sad dark ball bed crying sometimes breath i sensing chest moments nothing sometimes quiet becomes haunting yet whispers tell soul wanting sometimes i think sad follows loving i sigh know deep feeling sometimes reminders keep me hurting i stop i feel loss stop thinking sometimes softness envelops i relax moment i dreaming sometimes light breaks shining second reminds me ok keep living sometimes i find courage start moving i hesitate take step forward toward hoping sometimes i sad light love honor i always missing sometimes i sad
