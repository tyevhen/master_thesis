three years ago age i wrote post unschooling teen rebellion remains one popular controversial posts i ever written yet i read i wince bit i longer believe much i wrote case i would approach topic differently post i sound much well rebellious confrontational i want i sound like i trying shock people i think i part i different place mean anything wrong head age mean i find myself wanting revisit topic perspective i currently life i look back teenage years deep gratitude parents i said facebook recently mother always one unschooling respectful parenting even father periods doubt whole unschooling thing parents always without fail trusted me sister judgement teen rebellion long something joke family exist parents never problem me emilie staying late going houses friends parents know going parties anything really trusted issue looking back i appreciate much probably large part trusted also trustworthy sure made mistakes sometimes never anything horribly reckless dangerous made good choices trust goes ways curfew tell parents going planned back sister i going home later planned called similarly parents also told going planned back would call changes plans i shared many times me perfectly illustrates parenting teen years work without top rules enforced way touch parents looking me sister without placing strict limits matter mutual respect family members things always go perfectly sometimes i going late calls forgotten leading stress arguments lead grounding punishments discussions initial argument passed recognition people make mistakes moving things problems teen years sure hard teenager problems struggling help friends suicidal using dangerous drugs abused parents personal struggles anxiety depression friendships falling apart figuring personal identities things difficulties me parents caused things parents disapproved part got along well usual arguments tension found house four different people trying co exist two going difficult life stage communication channels remained open always lot honest conversations happening house i developed political social views teens discovering developing beliefs values identity big part teen yet also sadly often point contention teenagers beliefs differ parents i argued father sometimes politics real arguments i genuinely upset yet neither mother ever tried forbid stifle explorations father certainly anarchist never tried stop me going anarchist bookfair reading anarchist literature teens lot people condescending towards views convinced rebellious phase i get find sensible opinions soon enough pretty insulting upsetting me time certainly proven true far though i shifted approaches views quite bit ways core values politics i discovered teens still ones i hold today i decide anarchist i wanted rebel i found value ideals social equality cooperative collective decision making breaking hierarchies imaging organize live world none changed always based resonated me deep level attempt horrify adults around me resistance heart business usual prints bread puppet glover vt alcohol drugs never big deal big part life i like first mention majority readers usa quebec i grew still live culture around alcohol quite different legal drinking age parents frequently start offering children sip wine dinner children young yes teens still sometimes steal alcohol parents liquor cabinet drink without parents permission overall teens drinking considered nearly big deal family i could taste anything i wanted i think parents happy i discovering alcohol like made me feel safety house family i better equipped make choices much i drank outside house situations less safe different families handle things differently people alcohol substance abuse immediate family probably different approach i want hold family experience good idea i think worked well i count fingers one hand many times life i drunk even never drunk enjoy alcohol much life always moderation drugs used friends caused problems i teens times i feared friends using scarier drugs friends social lives came revolve way much around drug use me want spend much time point life i friends use substances friends hand around joint sometimes drugs large defining part life way holds true sister i share personal experience mind altering substances many people seem convinced teenagers without rigid control quickly become addicted every substance imaginable party constantly i want put idea rest developing addictions many contributing factors genetics family history unhappiness rebellion magical fix set steps guarantee someone never abuse alcohol drugs i say though general vast majority unschoolers i know far less likely drinking drug use schooled young adults i know also likely responsible use alcohol drugs leads me believe raising teens respect open communication helps teens make healthy choices substances use use rebel something rebel teenage rebellion bad behaviour became running joke family me sister left alone house days father would mock sternly tell wild parties full realization friend tea party much likely scenario even i going party father gravity muster tell me anything would similarly i remember story told told me friend unschooling mother relating conversation young teenage daughter daughter kept suggesting increasingly outrageous things could rebel mother shrug suggestion daughter got well i date corporate lawyer point mother finally reacted horror life filled strict rules lists things forbidden part actually like get along parents really much push back rebellion sake rebellion often involves lot really unsafe teenage behavior lot adults come think teens somehow naturally irresponsible risky though taking risks pushing envelope extent natural part teen many truly unsafe behaviours born purely desire take risks direct reaction control basically many teens poor parental relationships deliberately things piss know would cause disapproval rebellion direct opposition controlling forces lives many unschoolers i know myself included never experienced simply relationships respected felt caused feel need unsafe things merely sake many teenagers parents large source stress lives remove rigid control replace communication mutually respectful parent teen relationships parents longer likely major source stress instead parents become people teen feels safe going need help advice teens feel comfortable sharing big things going life without fear parental reprisal also means parents lot influence lives teens much better position help children make good choices parents rely rigid set rules teens may may follow parents sight control equal caring i heard argued one occasion teens strict rules enforced punishments makes teenagers feel loved i sure people say actually know teens i realize comes mistaken idea control way involved show concern parent call going late rule house shows parents show care children concerned knowing children home picking plans get home go wrong listening need someone talk thousand ways teens feel loved parents show caring even better teens feel loved respected treated capable making good choices people faith abilities makes feel thus capable guarantees life following steps z wo absolutely assure teen rebellion non existent however respect trust parents teens make really big difference lives respectfully parented unschooling teens families thanks relationships way parents treated me sister may rebelled certain aspects world live rebellion still engaged never anything rebel family busy trying figure messy emotional difficult change filled teen years together family fighting curfews grades one best arguments i think treating teens like make important decisions lives relative ease bring teen years thanks relationships i look back teen years gratitude parents way raised me sister teenager might hard treated like i capable trustworthy person made difference me i spent whole life feeling like i trustworthy i learn trust judgement adult i already knew one reasons i feel strongly trusting teens positive important thing teen years helping young people transition adulthood spending whole life treated capable trustworthy needed constant supervision rules curriculum keep line guide right directions suddenly told adult take care make sure make good decisions seems ludicrous teens instead given freedom opportunity make important choices take real responsibilities still supportive family environment practicing art capable person years mean wo floundering adulthood experience certainly says otherwise confidence abilities good start i hope people extend bit lot trust teens watch wonderfully unfolds
