new poem i wrote old haunts norcal mendocino woodlands cataract cloud slips sun lighting meadow nettles whose sting soft persistent clings wrist day ferns droop banks moss blackberry vines clutch jeans pleading spring young horsetails cattails sprout along path like oversized asparagus redwood grove huge stumps dwarf trunks living trees witness slaughter loggers monuments time thick barked monsters ruled forest redwood needles mud carpeted leaves dog limp less noticeable pitiless city i throw stick river swollen browned rain kenyon slow fetch stick mouth seeks asylum island bare limbed bushes beaten rain gorged waters i call reluctantly paddles back shore ditching stick river cold today emaciated frame later gravelly pool water streams beneath chest belly contentedly licks forelimbs clean kathleen brush bracken fur may never rebound year former friends friends i think capable slaughtering great trees
