yesterday mother i went walk i took camera truly lovely day saw new shoots emerging leaves unfurling plants growing everywhere sun shining old rosehips new buds sun made everything bright hazy camera lense wondered wrong berries birds never ate fall windy day water curling small waves hit shore i love pattern branches sky new buds windblown branches moon bright blue sky bird mourning dove sits wire outside house almost every day singing sweet melancholy song i spend time outside every day i feel like i living life properly yet time taking walks often saddens me much development pavement cars lonely patches bedraggled woods things way supposed sunny day still beautiful peace idzie
