tv watching book reading often seem seen somewhat opposite activities books seen worthwhile good brain useful way spend time tv waste time useless brain rotting lazy pursuit life never way i considered two activities i might made distinctions fiction non fiction documentaries dramas tv books never either one versus activities brought me great joy yes led lot learning books i reading myself parents reading aloud daily stories form another always part life i started reading myself i dove world novels big way years i read three even four short novels day i still easily race newest book favourite series course single day novels draw me lead incredible amount investment imaginary people worlds i also like sharing i read became common practice family years ago tell stories reading sharing book enthusiastic really nice social activity tv watching though i find interesting considering reading often considered meaningful activity reading often deeply personal immersive activity benefits say tv somehow better i far convinced either better instead feel provide whole lot positives television ready watch yet i ask th time i patient person around show caught attention big draw despite impatience desire watch next episode soon i able i almost always watch shows people four make family watch variety british mysteries genre shows police procedurals assorted dramas currently veronica mars big started season three great excitement many people tv watching looks like something solitary something done isolation passive activity involving social interaction experience could i almost always watch tv family bursting laughter together nudging elbow good bits occasionally grabbing fear well okay mostly i one also talk throughout watching veronica mars countless conversations car washing dishes sometimes middle episode paused course happening plot killed lily could somehow involved every character actions motivations dissected examined enthusiastic discussion fun treat shows especially mysteries way becomes real bonding experience people watching social involved experience also anything passive watching shows becomes something engaging social something leads lot thinking discussing sharing looking critically media pop culture i think one important things i learned critically look different types media i said workshop day ability analyze think critically i consuming whether novels non fiction books tv shows movies news newspaper comic books magazines invaluable skill one brought much richness lots deep thought thoughtful conversations life i learned young parents someone says something tv even news mean true sister i learned teens broaden deepen analysis various forms media entertainment i discussions subtle sexism buffy vampire slayer well major failings comes issues representation racism i talked neo liberal pro military bias liberal leaning news network i good conversations spiritwalker trilogy kate elliott remarkably excellent job portraying range women characters well creating fantasy world racially culturally diverse interesting i recently heard suggested tv dangerous simply often considered fluff junk unworthy serious thought thus people absorb lot messages prejudices watch engaging critically viewing seems possible me serves good argument treating tv important part peoples lives affects think learn said books often contain messages might feel harmful well i feel like books tv lot common many people realize potential negatives lot parents lot worries screens negative impact health wise children however books without negative consequences either three books day phase still sometimes i get wrapped story i read point eye strain tension headaches i got date prescription glasses i read point increased blurry vision optometrist make point telling me i stop reading every ten minutes look window focus something far away health eyes i know comes physical comfort i generally find computer screens worst reading page next watching tv comfortable focusing something bit away easier point i really trying get everything healthier moderation tv necessarily worse less healthy anything else compared similarly stationary pursuits i feel like many people might say well fine obviously special children would watch tv day different people different needs easier less easy time listening bodies maybe need less parental help figuring things i think parents often sell kids short thinking ever watch tv attitude shows strong perhaps somewhat misplaced bias one form entertainment learning also seems take account one want one thing forever boredom starts set also important children parental involvement support figure feels good bad best done exploring trying different things figuring sitting couch hours tend make feel good i caution parents examine biases consider would say already read much week something else maybe pause moment saying television developing healthy relationship screens pages i think rich healthy relationship different types media best gained experiencing involved adults adults want hear story child reading talk sometimes criticize see tv read print basically adults engage shows movies watch books magazines read discussing thinking help children learn engaged critical children really one consume media less common ways listening audio books instead reading whether due learning disabilities simply personal preferences going respect individual different learn experience world different ways i think part realizing placing various activities hierarchy best worst least educational counterproductive learning process say i entirely parents ever intervening children use various media i i think creating arbitrary distinctions things like tv books makes little sense ideal environment creating excitement learning forms including screens pages life i love i take intense joy new tv show find favourite novel i find myself feeling guilty spending time either things i love i critical i consume i able deconstruct things thoughtful conversations well enjoying something without feeling need strongly critical armed knowledge needed navigate media pop culture around me without guilt useless bogging me i wonderful time exploring worlds fiction non fiction alike continues bonding experience others collection ways i learned lot cool things stretched thinking new ways brought countless fun enjoyment life conclusion books tv pretty great
