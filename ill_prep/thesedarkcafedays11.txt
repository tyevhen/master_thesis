i feel numb i feel hollow i hate today i ca wait tomorrow maybe i get place i shed skin i feel trapped maybe i start moving i get away horrible emptiness i know i short time left i spent whole summer dreaming would keep niggling back mind might never see knows ever want talk plenty else going life i realize badly i i felt hollowness near even saw gotten really talk every part me aches text ask something together i always tell myself busy part me keeps thinking maybe something supposed help me get awful summer ray light otherwise dreary time i supposed move i hate part me i hate thought i wish could either go backwards finally got alone together equal terms honest needed me wanted me could go forwards i could know whether lost cause happy destiny i know different i probably naive probably sentimental enough me i care way i never felt anyone else i felt like letting go overanalyzing falling course i fallen yet another inaccessible person i numb i hollow i know turn i supposed past unrequited love falling people want me depression panic attacks keep coming back i keep falling
