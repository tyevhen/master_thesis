article published last week slate titled bill gates autodidact probably i read yesterday pretty eye roll inducing i decided time write rebuttal blog article starts talking bill gates young age gates already autodidact someone compelled learn needed know course life gates maintained habit dropped college two years continued education incessant reading conversing michael specter new yorker writer profiled gates magazine said microsoft founder one autodidacts reads reads reads reads hundreds books immunology biochemistry biology asks lot questions bill gates get talk whoever wants many gates fellow leaders ed tech world also members autodidact club computer scientists engineers entrepreneurs academics self selected group individuals schooled fast changing field settled syllabus well established curriculum seems pretty clear case someone seeing autodidacts special geniuses destined greatness matter face autodidact club thus considered something pretty exclusive though particular club might exclusive i think pretty misleading think fact autodidacts main thing sets apart i argue sets apart business people corporatists wealthy largely male also almost certainly largely white statistically richest successful people america tend white male i figure pretty good guess people every man i think autodidact much source author continues main point article people autodidacts order learn effectively need guidance provided teachers need support provided peers need structure provided institutions i know whole lot unschoolers would disagree productive learning without guidance support others rare seems author suffers misconception self directed learning means learning entirely completely alone help ever i disagree major way learners need guidance provided teachers structure provided institutions self directed learners need people peers mentors parents yes sometimes even teachers thing self directed means individual making decisions lives learning decisions include large amount people even large amount structure depends individual learner want need pair eminent researchers gone far call notion self directed learning urban legend education i well i told sister emilie urban legend thing laughed hi i bigfoot response emilie life life proof supposed truth lest anyone quickly jump must special conclusion i like point every single unschooler i met proof absurd idea lifelong unschoolers unschoolers left school elementary middle high school unschoolers left school struggling unschoolers left feel challenged unschoolers whose parents made choice unschool individuals chose managing learn fine self directed way find apparently eminent researchers conclusions paper published educational psychologist last year paul kirschner open university netherlands jeroen van merri nboer maastricht university challenge popular assumption learner knows best controlling force learning three problems premise van merri nboer kirschner write first novices definition yet know much subject learning ill equipped make effective choices learn next second problem learners often choose prefer prefer always best practice tasks enjoy already proficient instead tackling difficult tasks would actually enhance expertise third although learners like options unlimited choices quickly become frustrating well mentally taxing constraining learning freedom supposed liberate i find myself reading make sure i actually read properly first time reads like regular criticisms everyone self directed learning children know best ca trust children people say one making hard things never anything difficult though honest i never heard researchers last assertion choices bad wow okay i think i different person researchers apparently pretty overwhelmed vast variety choices life represents i loved sister put discussion article said theory might unlimited choices actually life work way want go eat theoretically could go single restaurant city reality choices going based close within price range type cuisine like mood friends family going dinner like practice able pare theoretical choices actual options pretty quickly choices including learning work emilie said i could try go engineering school tomorrow choice i could make would make sense based interests goals past choices i made 'too many choices bad thing seems pretty detached reality people make choices comes needing experienced teachers steer novice learner i mentioned unschoolers often choose make people part learning emilie taking ninjutsu classes since ca learn ninjitsu choice start classes choice continue self directed yes something pursuing alone i wondered researchers quoted context seemed me paper sounded like attempt legitimizing educators want believe regards self directed learning ca possibly work even though obviously anything else really case sadly seems summary paper article takes critical look three pervasive urban legends education nature learners learning teaching looks educational psychological research say three legends seen variations one central theme namely learner knows best controlling force learning first legend one learners digital natives form generation students knowing nature learn new media old media methods used teaching learning longer work second legend widespread belief learners specific learning styles education individualized extent pedagogy teaching learning matched preferred style learner final legend learners ought seen self educators given maximum control learning learning trajectory concludes possible reason legends taken hold pervasive difficult eradicate i disagree common notions recently self directed education become trendy vast majority people still feel strongly way people learn taught teacher school authors paper provide new research simply quote research done others pulled specifically make points pretty clearly stated summary i point slate article obscures fact talking specifically idea self directed learning online though authors paper claim looking seem lump self directed learning together whether online i say slate article pretty accurate representation authors saying basically pissed teachers might losing power students gaining want stop claim science behind changes bad back slate article according bio article story produced hechinger report nonprofit nonpartisan education news outlet based teachers college columbia university i think really puts perspective might nonpartisan i hardly consider teacher college unbiased comes role teachers schools society livelihood depends teachers retaining power students staying school listening teachers reason subject seems important author central point author seems attempting drive home protection livelihood self directed learning everyone people ca special people learn way i grew life learner autodidact i called important shots education still today i sneak house gates work supercomputers i read texts immunology biochemistry i scientist engineer academic accounts i part exclusive autodidact club made rich influential i plain old run mill self directed learner type learned read i loved harry potter memorized old poems wrote books reviews studied world war ii played hours sister learned alongside family child i type autodidact spends hours kitchen working new dish tons time writing self directed education type reads books living less money imagining domesticity saved i quit worrying money became richest man world radical homemakers reclaiming domesticity consumer culture unschooling alternative education i finished challenging assumptions education recently middle unschooling unmanual i go workshops talks conferences favourite subjects unschooling alternative education preserving food life education looks intimately shaped passions interests goals self directed learner works sometimes look impressive sometimes wo perfectly fine impressive autodidacts whole certainly part special club i also think important recognize role school forced teaching play killing motivation unschoolers end repeating time time humans innate learners babies learn walk talk burning desire learn grow become part culture find humans perhaps best defined ability learn ability adapt flexibility busy minds seem hard many people grasp learning something must induced someone something make people learning something need support encourage sometimes keep way supportive environments provided people stop putting blocks front learners form curriculum must followed times learning must occur tests assessments grading learning happen enthusiastically well want learn nature i autodidact life learner i sometimes prefer call myself know embrace enjoy uniquely individual self directed learning journey
