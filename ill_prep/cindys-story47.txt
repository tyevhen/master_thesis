sometimes i want sleep dark heaviness pulls me muscles face droop hold smile eyelids lower without help i look blinds almost completely pulled closed dark house little light gets i focus one thing time edges around circle stare fuzzy brightness i notice sun shines blinders mind keep sounds around me bleed one another make jumble slight hum background mind nothing clear ears close attention breathing sighs things real tunnel vision front me stretches floor quicksand step causes me sink deeper deeper deepness watery fine grains sand finally pulls boots makes sucking noises pop feet i manage pull foot way sand foot though go back quicksand option way step backwards rise struggle engulfed stop silent stuck slow sink eats me side me rock walls chasm i reaching coming closer closer together i climb rocks fingers toes i could weights hanging shoulders would pull me slip lose grip every new hold wall i make muscles shake exhaustion i feel pain legs arms maybe pain real maybe i feel focus thought grows mind yet maybe aches real i slowly wasting away i find energy movement gas tank needs refilling gas station direction hundreds miles hopeless nothing else i i must succumb i must stop go away go away go away i tell world i curl ball squeeze eyes closed press hands ears rock body back forth awareness life much me right reason stay awake i take sleep sleep sleep forever yes i think dark heaviness go away yet i dream body mind succumb sleep one day someone awaken me vanquish sleep give me lifted strengthened vivid life cindy
