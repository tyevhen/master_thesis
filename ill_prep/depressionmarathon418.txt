last days tough i think i experiencing little dip mood i think cold gray wet weather helped one bit i think seen sun past days degrees gray wet least consecutive days end sight i never experienced wet gray spring i hope i never even year old patients amazed never seen anything like saying something cold wet gray finally worn me i think staying upbeat positive surrounded gray gotten difficult mood beginning match weather past several days i tired less energy i struggled irritability something i usually struggle especially work i found less joy simple things fretted things i control i sought friends less spent time alone signs something amiss course like many days i worry heavy black fog slowly engulfing me yet i feel confident i handle even little different i worried darkness descending i also sense i get may easy comfortable i definitely wo like i know pass i walk one step one day time i know i i done many times i walked lot darkness pain past years yet i history side let hope anticipation naught tomorrow another day perhaps sun shine perhaps mood brighten perhaps days entirety episode hopefulness i hang onto i say prayers close eyes tonight stay well friends
