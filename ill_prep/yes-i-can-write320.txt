i got message someone little ago i figured response may interest readers original email italics response regular font blog interesting me i tried leave comment january post unschooling long thus i hope mind receiving comment via mail thoughtful articulate writer i enjoyed reading blog thank i glad enjoyed blog i best address comments concerns honestly possible since i think exchange may interest readers i going post blog well i attended traditional public school united states near washington dc i really bad experience myself parents hippies relaxed parenting style maybe counterbalanced public school experience even though public school worked me ideas behind unschooling bizarre nonsensical me i find philosophy appealing fact yet i concerns i shake i wonder think pretty much everyone actually unschooling concerns ca shake unschooling different norm far widely accepted views people learn hard wrap mind around hell i eclectically homeschooled i unschooled throughout teens i really gained complete confidence bit year ago first i think subjects would difficult learn unschooling math example builds mastering advanced concepts might take years intensive study practice small child wants astronaut may hard connect goal dull task learning multiplication tables yet would difficult learn calculus without learning one multiplication tables i guess i skeptical young children even older children would ability assess need know reach particular goal discipline learn material comprises dull building blocks support goal actually unschoolers learn math easily subjects though many parents choose unschool kids though certainly near liberal arts types unschooling children teens complete mix math science oriented arts language oriented people many unschoolers gone college maths sciences area even though i definitely big fan math done poke math book since i i basic math head faster accurately good friend mine graduated public high school top class actually top entire grade public school teaches use calculator many students go high school without gaining real understanding mathematics also interest i heard anecdotal stories unschoolers happily study well higher maths college without ever memorized times tables i trust children faith abilities certain subjects nature abstract makes much less likely draw child interest i would worry possibility son might decide age wants astronaut yet would know multiplication tables yes could learn would years catching would unfortunate i think seems me unschooling much better suited children interests goals literature arts maybe history social sciences etc much hard sciences math areas actually i would say words show lack trust children natural learning process many young children become fascinated numbers language building things insects math part life made something dreaded many people school interesting thing learn also make mistake believing things must learned certain time never learned many unschoolers go mid late teens without ever cracking open math textbook yet decide want take sat get college study bit pass sat unschoolers go college i minority since i plan go university variety fields take ten years textbook study get math needed enter college even going fields math science i recently talking schooled friend possibility writing test high school leaving certificate telling i thought i need study months able pass response could one month using textbooks mean spending years learning little catching needed i also think value learning things necessarily find interesting sometimes upon exposed know might interest also things worth knowing might interesting example i know people know little history think dull irrelevant say really stupid things current events issues obvious statements due complete ignorance anyone prone i ca help wonder unschoolers would particularly prone also make mistake thinking unschooling parents play passive role throughout childhood teen years mom would bring interesting books house also personal library least books i believe share interesting articles paper send me links cool websites articles online tell me activities i may find interesting made make regular trips library i young participated numerous activities unschoolers exposed far world since actually living world schooled kids stuck inside building day away real world taught limited curriculum say open minded unschooling yet words seem judgmental lifestyle admittedly know little taught something get anything retain knowledge means something seems interesting important i guessing people make ignorant remarks history schooled i know people i heard make comments like either traditionally schooled homeschooled unschooled taught history meaningless boring true learning takes place learner interested subject otherwise simply rote memorization last i think mistake think public education really content taught part post i think think public education content either i see raised point addressing questions people ask parent i generally think job handle content really learning subjects requires experience involvement i traveling europe china wherever instead reading places textbook visiting museums nature centers etc always true subjects public education teach content i thinking math dull building blocks easily taught public school subjects content taught effectively people forget long term think real goal public school teach submission obedience i quite agree i think effect parents careful i think i think necessarily instead i think one valuable things public school experience teaches maintain sense self dignity identity sense control self definition environment everything within control life must deal people like rules find objectionable policies find foolish life choices may help limit exposure things life choices require learn deal things becoming lawyer astronaut example requires ability navigate certain systems educational systems career systems government systems learning navigate systems manipulate effectively achieve goals essential skill imho say every kind life path requires i friends artists dancers craftsmen part avoided systems person learned navigate systems far fewer choices life become lawyer astronaut doctor veterinarian achieving goals requires knowing function environment entirely self created interest driven i glad agree public school really content taught however i find incredibly sad realize school place constant assault dignity sense self yet think children forced spend every single day environment unschooler i grown safe loving nurturing environment i healthy happy individual confidence interact world many people many institutions trying undermine dignity sense self many people impressed unschooling teens unschooling creates whole human developed healthily thanks wonderful environment grew i see many schooled teens adults damaged system created shell i think attempting get talk learning survive school environment inside shell insecure scared failure know function healthy way also learned external validation sort validation must always live another persons expectations maybe unschoolers learn function environment without public school certainly life provide opportunities learn skill small doses i went public school i encouraged participate achieve means end end i taught parents ask questions challenge teachers i encouraged use public school resources purposes submit i glad i encouraged current life part time lawyer full time mom would impossible without formal education ability achieve standardized tests including bar exam ability function workplace i sometimes required spend time subjects i find interesting compelling essential underpinnings larger goals i find laudable learn work system whether go school i member royal canadian air cadets three years literally based military fun components tossed since designed youth quite structured rigid ranking system separate levels grades jazz i never school i count kindergarten i chose leave cadets i highest rank i could amount years i i hated i discovered i never going part sort structure i certainly function need rigidly structured institution entire life able function one i already said unschoolers way limited options yet another assumption make unschoolers never anything fun since forced silly everyone goals aspirations want something badly enough going whatever needs done get whether individual activity fun unschoolers pointless busywork mean work towards things important i continue things i particularly enjoy yet i necessary something truly matters me something i passionate i find i really want take course offered school wo accept me unless i high school leaving certificate likely since universities area accept students without paperwork i take months study get certificate i like learning things value me i would i wanted certificate i get i wanted i would older son starts kindergarten later month i lot trepidation i feeling going like going terribly good going add much knowledge i sending anyway i think essential navigate world cater sole master i curious see i also open minded possibility poor fit offer nothing valuable case i would willing change gears options would table including unschooling culture foster human happiness seeks maximize production consumption else schooling system creating worker bees worker bees economic system needs say think young children shoved system indifferent emotional well good thing i say terrible unschooling raises whole human beings human beings comfortable skin healthy confident whole human beings navigate unfriendly society far successfully people whose souls crushed school system i find hard believe consider unschooling since come across feeling negatively towards speak one believes public schooling best seems me saying think children go school learn unimportant feelings emotional health i apologize i offend response intention simply subject i feel passionately words hurt heart i hurt son children sent school year sound like also believe school hurt son sending sort tough love
