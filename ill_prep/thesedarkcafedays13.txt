even demeaning especially counselors good teaching someone entire background take several sessions might still understand coming i figured i okay without anyways since last post i found series mistakes school part i ca graduate next month guy i liked even crappier person i thought i definitely ca like two big things driving me stress busyness semester knowledge i finally graduating excitement liking someone talking trying talk anticipating possibility dating i think i honestly convinced myself i would finally get chance romantic relationship time summer rolled around i excited prospect propelled me assignments late nights i like schoolwork semester i love creative projects nothing motivates excites me way crush i know truth unfortunately reverse nothing breaks me way losing person usually i realize interested me though sometimes like case i come cold hard acceptance person me even though i really really admire i really love caring people admiring looking best turning myself someone i grown adore heartbreaking i guess i many others often turn hating talking smack person seems like way channel strong feelings something besides admiration sometimes i still obsessed person time i want berate hear others tear lengthy discussions wondering earth interested relationship me ultimately two blows robbed me two big dreams sources excitement motivation i feel stuck time inches along whereas felt like zooming speed light i still major assignments due almost every day however i really want let growing darkness get best me i struggling fight brain feels like neverland never going find love never going happy never going escape depression ruining things me never going desired i chase tail prison anxiety angst today especially bad rainy days help thursday i particularly frustrating interaction guy i liked actually good banter even told me heard able graduate really sorry majority girl friends even done later class i heard talking drugs realized really lead completely different lifestyles i gave big presentation afternoon publicized class missed getting high somewhere flashback times i hoped guys would come events support me show anyways i went period shock i wrestled admiration guy good qualities growing amount information i receiving friend mine well interaction guy seriously immature traits interest women i want let go i slowly realized i protection naturally lovesick young thing i i turned back former crush mine someone i really really liked subsequently really hate try get i know made me go back except really seemed like one compatible people i liked i strong feelings problem get i cut communication including unfriending social media i non awkward way getting back touch course i began obsess situation ask myself whether

check see i okay tempting coldness like made ending seem i want badly love people invest friendships i love showing people kindness thoughtfulness i get tired little people invest relationships appreciate people lives i felt tempted stop investing relationships depressing prospect ultimately today really tough i scared think tomorrow going like i realized i need one embraces myself i felt embarrassed today interested guy i previously ranted end day i rather somebody honest going back forth someone denies ever different side one point i driving class i decided accept i flip flop lot things part personality way i process i think necessarily wrong though i understand might frustrate people i would rather open minded things someone makes snap judgment never reconsiders people situations constantly changing oftentimes worth reevaluating opinion i changed much life i firmly believe better i also accept i i i want person corner obviously i going get validation acceptance i seeking people i either get torn people disappoint me friendship i experience validation via grades applause occasional positive interaction still feel unsatisfied i guess i need accept myself even i get i really crave relationship person really invested excited me vice versa i need firm grounding i i get lost person i survive relationship work i perfect way i sure anyone could read post pick apart identify host character flaws psychological issues i trying really hard better person love others improve methods dealing tough times i choose accept i still growing way life works ca get right maybe like ever
