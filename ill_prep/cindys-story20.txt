written cindy boersma high school years i sit alone back river longing see face i peer warm heavy fog across deep murky waters strain eyes far shore i call name hear ruthless wind whisked pleading words away i try use looking calling post bank river i hope fog clear friends come along stop side confidence point way i think i see shadow enough hold i want see i keep trying seeking calling crying exhaustion takes tole fretful sleep i raise head fog rising water i able see cool mist remains river running without hesitation i jump feet i search far shore longing eyes rest face whole time reach toward find distance still remains i search face meaning something grasp hope calm fears searching know i long understand pain sense fears distance tell mist tears tell mist tears
