conferences popping people even starting recognize term even still sure means i feel increased interest positive thing shows dissatisfied many people current system misconceptions important questions added exposure unschooling usually exposure presented misleading sensationalized way comes lot misconceptions concept gives rise ton different questions i like address ones i encountered frequently get way right beginning many people think unschooling parents caregivers enforce educational structure children unschooling automatically means structure true since unschooling puts learning hands learners choose much little structure personally want thus outside might even look like unschoolers school curriculum schedule classes take homeschool co op difference structure freely chosen learner decided way learn best way feel happiest learning token unschooling parents may suggest various classes structured activities learner free say yes unschooling mean textbooks classes means textbooks classes unless want also common believe unschooling parents usually teach children though may children ask uninvolved lives learning could truth unschooling parents generally extremely involved helping children navigate world exposing interesting things helping access various resources books classes mentors many cases simply sharing discovery wonder children experience daily lives sometimes people like say unschooling would work motivated individuals especially intelligent special people could succeed unschooling i really could disagree i especially motivated especially special though i suppose flattering many people seem think people fail realize nothing gets way joy people really love learning humans good learning empowered trusted education unschoolers motivated learn motivated
