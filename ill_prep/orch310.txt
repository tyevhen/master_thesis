happy easter everyone today i wrapping recent two test series played new zealand weekend perth i mention standout players special moments games i explain pretty interesting statistic kookaburras use match called got finish thoughts selection affects me group first new zealand neighbours oldest rivals always always battles often fierce contests played intensity energy emotion high skill level however opinion matches weekend showcased elements dribs drabs ran winners match scoreline probably flattered little although number good opportunities score minutes go still took late brace jake whetton put result beyond doubt played ok essential skills let times failed capitalise fair share chances lost control match briefly second half allowed new zealand sneak back new zealand seemed bit play usual spark unexpected match different i play seemed strong reaction black sticks muscled applied pressure contest hard nosed physical desperate played better tone enthusiasm match ended draw chances hard come sides guys happy match afterwards cited lack good connections sloppy basic skills areas required attention stood me jake whetton small stature large influence whetto played one match seemed involved everything good set one goal scored brace highlighted terrific tomma almost impossible angle goal snatched back control game second killed energy contagious variety leads bamboozled kiwi defence joel carroll action slotted back side ease playing matches joel typical rock like self defence constantly slapped penetrating balls high forwards fair bit time definitely better run looked ominous without ball russell ford celebrated th cap match great career date russ consistently brilliant striker past two years continues improve grow confidence goal scoring ability best world ball awareness situational knowledge superb getting better every day ripe old age special mention must also go dean cousins black sticks skipper played th match perth truly awesome achievement many players reach milestone like could sense new zealand lads rose occasion match doubt tried get much deserved victory captain congrats dean moving coach ric charlesworth loves stats could give stat

finish today focus turns world cup selections happening weekend nerve wracking time everyone handles selection process differently deals pending news way hardest part selection knowing limited room
