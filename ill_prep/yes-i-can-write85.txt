i came across post couple weeks back i sure many readers react quite strongly big mainstream media source dissing unschooling instead member unschooling community left school teens spoken couple unschooling conferences author discusses radical unschooling faults sees go read continuing want done reading okay let me continue i want start saying i appreciate eli honestly many interesting discussions several years back attended conference extent i agree points larger extent i disagree i like take things bit bit break i like dislike post parents made me i glad i find odd first main example given always schooled individual moral anecdote seemingly often good parents make kids things seems me one story someone schooled grateful parents making large decision really make sense me discussing unschooling different framework living often different style parenting unschooling regular schooling families really feel like author comparing apples oranges i like calling anyone fruits seemed apt expression use yeah okay person happy real impact topic hand story grown unschooler wishing parent made different choices grateful time parents pushed something i know least cases would present far compelling argument increased parental control me i ultimately necessarily agree i find made stronger case mention bad crowds well sit right me i believe bad crowds usually defined discussed though i believe teens really struggling coping struggles best sometimes teen person age really group people treat really badly wrong one put time i still would say hypothetical group question bad unhealthy filled people would greatly benefit given safe spaces spend time supportive older people spend time bad crowd often vicious value judgement makes even harder live teen culture continuing story schooled individual whose parents saved bad crowds eli says maybe radical unschoolers would acknowledge case parents sending child school choosing exception radical unschooling approach best thing course might insist parents taken school altogether i might disagree maybe still run crowd town well i come something frustrates me lot people decide decision made matter made course action could resulted good outcomes really know know i know i genuinely think i worse place i school i actually certain i maybe woman question better decision parents made maybe would even better worked troubles i ca help think situation come radical unschooling family would ended good end perhaps better sense personal power say way things could worked seems short sighted least importance environment eli brings interesting point discusses environment saying unschoolers radical otherwise talk people natural motivation learn ultimately best often acknowledge power environment i motivated affected available needed others considered 'cool etc i agree perhaps much effected culture around recognized much could i like daniel quinn characterization voice mother culture generally i thinking i say unschooling enough i mean unschooling alone come anywhere close solving tremendous amount problems ways living relating earth need question lot education system i think unschooling good start i question whether increased parental control really going positive impact children teens learn deal various pressures situations faced day day basis i said discussion tv watching common example radical unschoolers bring noted eli post parents involved kids discussing problematic things encounter every day i believe far productive simply trying keep kids away everything believe harmful completely impossible trying take much world many unschoolers seek similarly i believe important parents active part teens lives decisions make important parents guides mentors i sure parents making choices believe best children without consent good thing parents regularly children best interests genuinely heart make decisions i inclined think really bad said absolutes rarely true i sure parents making choices kids wishes sometimes works really well sometimes kids question end happy whatever decisions made i also really fan people deciding exactly right way everyone relate interact family people best communicate make decisions makes individuals families happy healthy differ person person family family i strongly believe respected trusted people regardless age open genuine communication happening collective cooperative decisions made better everyone tends end feeling ultimately situation unique everyone best whatever truly feel best seems eli i agree says personally i think ideal truly happy healthy people know best share gifts world makes radical unschoolers different eli says almost parents radical unschoolers think unrestricted access tv bedtimes junk food video games ridiculous concentrating things radical unschoolers differentiate parents every group needs way identifying well feels like selling radical unschooling little short i never felt like important things radical unschoolers unrestricted access candy i think often used examples radical unschoolers agree things provide easy examples articulating ways approaching parenting radical unschooling philosophy play everyday life comparing way might usually handled way ru parent might handle things still seems me radical unschooling discussed focus remains squarely trusting respecting children sugar wii ultimately eli comes conclusion truly differentiates radical unschoolers concentration forcing children anything impose rules well i really disagree rules ever necessary i believe rules neither i believe laws though whole different story rules absolutes leave room context figuring handle different situation best way rules yet still physically stop child hitting someone pulling cat tail walking traffic rules necessary parent well i believe least likely cause bad behavior response authoritarian approach actually stop behavior i think rules help make people decent human beings i think acting kindness helping children partners friends neighbors kindness including holding around accountable less kind actions helps create people kind rules necessary dealing conflict i agree radical unschoolers often put lot focus conflict namely avoiding minimizing situations likely cause conflict parents children i also agree eli conflict unavoidable i differ greatly though level conflict i think okay fights change toilet paper political opinions similar things inevitable major well depending political opinions i suppose aspect living others eli states sometimes parent make decision child really like child may angry long time initial gut reaction someone angry someone else long time almost always means important trust betrayed anger lasts long time means something wrong done i think damage necessarily irreparable though may well i definitely think okay cause much anger hurt arguments tightly controlling children children i mean people yet reached teens hold weight advocating controlling teens me i agree traditional parenting young kids arguments control seem sense least children really capable lot things older people though lot capable people give credit treated less humanity respect every human entitled teens teens remarkably capable people teens regularly raise children run households work activists million important difficult things teenagers mind deserving rights respect accorded adults one able make important decisions life teen never mind whether parents want say teens exactly adults usually need support assistance older people capability teens ones ultimately making important decisions lives well life pretty simple keep away muggles people eli says turned judgement intolerance met dealings radical unschoolers actually yeah exactly experience well personally friends even family told really unschooling many people said me felt extremely unwelcome radical unschooling even sometimes plain 'ol unschooling spaces online person often people new unschooling ideas quickly find certain questions concerns treated kindly expressed i talking people come unschooling spaces aggressively start interrogating everyone people respectfully worriedly ask questions philosophy really draws yet frightening time i try hard still expressing difficult ideas plainly honestly i make sure i never tell others wrong i believe things really unschooling i respect friends people homeschoolers relaxed homeschoolers regular schoolers i think freedom always better context way parent whose kids school gains inspiration creating home environment respectful teacher tries bring much inspiration unschooling classroom homeschooler convinces parents let pursue projects school time i feel i succeeded sharing unschooling ideas positive changes people make lives good even end unschooling radical unschooling mispractice i know eli criticism stem large part witnessed conferences 'cause thing unschooling conferences almost guaranteed seen least one instance probably one kids behaving disrespectful unkind ways around parents nothing sometimes seems radical unschooling ideals giving children great freedom areas life interpreted everything children ever okay expressing freedom well lots things okay family individual deal react situation different among people identify homeschoolers unschoolers radical unschoolers everyone else really one right way reacting situation though i definitely think fair say better worse ways ignoring unkind behavior matter age individual good strategy i understand eli plenty others witnessed turned unschooling altogether real shame unschooling community whole often really loathe self critique lets lot problems within community go unchecked unmentioned many though plenty people i really great conversations issues see often issues need addressed get perhaps main problem eli post generalizes hugely blatantly call radical unschoolers whole life learners otherwise extend freedom children beyond academics could considered traditionally educational large enough group generalize going wrong i know many really awesome people great parents feel even remotely comfortable someone equates radical unschooling radical unschoolers like call unparenting criticize problems decide problems shared every radical unschooler please decide obvious solution control people hold around kids friends accountable actions work improve situations responses recognize children need lots extra help navigating world without resorting authoritarianism eli says near end post need go root problems around want create real change i see reevaluating way treat children teens culture realizing authoritarian control never way create positive change never lead creation culture truly cooperative respectful humans non humans earth deeply important ca teach people respectful treating without respect ca teach people capable making good decisions making decisions think best ca teach people trust telling actions untrustworthy i rather think radical good word getting root things questioning foundation hierarchy authoritarianism puts youngest bottom treating children capable human beings deserving respect unfinished beings shaped controlled yeah i think pretty radical
