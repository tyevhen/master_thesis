following poem i wrote sometime junior senior year high school time i found myself sad crying lot i rework last verse bit tonight flow quite right otherwise rest original work time maybe time life could relate maybe cry me i crying tears blocking sight i stumbling though i holding might i still slipping wings wo take flight i keep falling falling i crying cry me wrong right head spinning things turn right i keep doubting long i keep fight i feel like quitting quitting i crying cry me though day feels like night heart hurting darkness shuts light use searching peace turned fright i ca stop trembling trembling i crying cry me tears flow i hide cry me emotions kept inside still truly see me always stay right side love me i crying i crying cry me thank jesus cindy
