today snowing i watching snow earlier today small flakes drifting slowly apparent rush reach ground later wind picked speed flakes swirling around miniature flurries seeming create momentary ghosts quickly scatter thousands individual shards i find hard believe grown people parts world never seen snow never walked frozen lake built snow forts i know true winter snow always big part life i truly miss another thing i understand called snowbirds leave warmer parts first whisper snow i would never want i admit time february rolls around i sick death brushing snow car every single time want go somewhere sick shoveling sick frostbit cheeks wet pant legs simply taking walk still definitely worth beauty fresh untouched snowfall catching snowflakes tongue way snowflakes glitter streetlight way voice muffled blanket snow huge snowball fight stumbling still laughing house warm wood stove nursing cup hot chocolate case noticed i poetic mood loving beautiful snow i said i posted pictures long i going remedy days grow colder i experiment black white photography blog look interesting way i experiment sepia tone i eat peanut butter fudge become pensive i watch snow pull fuzzy sweaters happily move inside escape cold outside go emi pipes drums school christmas party i continue make lots yummy stirfry i read paganism i continue find cool names cats put even snuggle time may beautiful cold weather days peace idzie
