selfish i make stuff thousands people actually diseases anyway stupid thing health anxiety basically whenever i start feeling bit unwell first thought could something serious like cancer i often laugh guys many times i diagnosed myself life threatening diseases worry stress comes false diagnosis pretty crippling i spent entire weeks planning life diseases could kill me soon finding team doctors i sore throat cold anxiety sportsman immune system constantly pressure train hard takes bad nights sleep many beers one afternoon start getting sniffly fatigued positive news health anxiety taken back seat last years unfortunately means things consumed mind important things things mean whole lot me age everything hockey relationships university simple things like i order dinner volume number tv feels like nothing really limits anxiety led one hardest periods life two months ago i told kookaburras playing group i needed take time deal issues without doubt one hardest things i ever i bounced hockey one friday morning great optimism feeling i told everyone happening i right i think i got five seconds speech lost luckily me coach poss reid jumped saved me i spent next minutes crying staring floor i even look anyone i got back though even tried jokes lighten mood went like lead balloons usual i even really remember i said i remember physio ellen yelling something like love orch towards end start recovery process i guarantee hockey related anxiety issues hidden guys around kookaburras program pretty well maybe i developed minor ways dealing anxiousness many would see time time example i cough lot unprovoked unnecessary coughing i believe i use continue breathing sounds stupid i often feel restricted chest think small cough enables me breathe properly i times day pretty annoying i sit still either i bounce legs wiggle toes really affect others people mentioned me worse i stuck place hours trips overseas sometimes i feel like i going explode body restless jumpy probably carries inability focus one given thing long periods time flight guys sit watch movies start finish me i watch half movie listen music minutes sudoku puzzles get move around watch another quarter movie fall asleep write blog read newspaper watch rest movie play game phone bouncing legs coughing i really struggle stay task bloody mentally exhausting thing happens home years i got scuffles guys training disagreed people meetings i guess time confrontation i come across uncaring insincere arsehole i assure persona displayed time totally different one behind closed doors i spent much time worrying incidents small disagreeing something someone team meeting big things like almost coming blows jamie dwyer training session i still worry incidents today i remember nearly every small disagreement push shove spray i handed i guess one answer issue control myself field i physical aggressive uncompromising player part reason i managed successful career date answer find peace i i stand field proving difficult well many characteristics extend field behaviour i really care point i constantly beat myself time time altercations i around hockey another example mealtime group tour sometimes player sits table me sit seat next me i feel i done something wrong i know probably even thought exact seat sit i mean i want guys jump next me time i crave attention though me learning understand exactly happening able master ability put things like rightful place i need learn learn deal every example ridiculous even me i know sounds crazy real concern me i guess next two examples probably worst me i get contact certain people life whatever reason i start panic time sometimes i call someone answer i think either hurt trouble maybe even worse lead severely overwhelming sense anxiety worry one fixed i see name pop phone i stalker calls times space minutes slight exaggeration i want make sure ok i getting better though rationalising situation asking myself chances kidnapped broad daylight raving murderous lunatic low another example popped world league one worried me whatever reason i remember looking hotel window balcony ladder one day thinking would happen i jumped anyone reading i guarantee suicidal thing i ever want jump fact thought entered head head noted anxiety sufferer set me real tailspin i thought since comfortable talking scared shit me i spoke team psych catherine length thankfully fantastic ability calm me reconfirm everything ok happened middle biggest event year world league event belgium pretty daunting i guess i let things get me i react varying situations pretty emotional i sensitive take things personally i worrier thinker i worry excessively kinds things hard part i also really like fun like missing things love communicating engaging people adventurous good time real yin yang kind thing wears me sometimes i find difficult sleep often feel tired fatigued anxiety creeps dreams well recent sleep study done several kookaburras sports physiologist world league event total sleep hours per night bad really deemed efficient sleep hours mostly i toss turn constantly rest guys tested averaged around hours efficient sleep night maybe twice week i wake panic i woken roommates asking i ok i ended top dining room tables trying escape creatures bed i swinging pillows imaginary intruders swinging hard well smashing lights knocking photos pretty scary i irrational fears often display signs perfectionism obsessive compulsive disorder probably part reason i always playing hair walking around cracks road incessantly washing hands body also produces lot weird feelings strange ordinary feelings far always proven life threatening me common ones tingling hands night sweats tight chest blurred vision i guess people things passing curiosity me always causes concern i sick life threatening cancer usually first three questions pop mind fear become overwhelming thought symptoms produce symptoms feels like sometimes real escape i guess hardest part me effect rest life i pretty open honest lot things life i struggled conversation many people partly i ignored partly i want burden others problems partly i people actively keeping busy enjoying myself i feel pretty good always hear stories people suffer mental illness ones assume battled think twice badge honour i think i one without doubt guys probably picked things years would make sense probably largely unaware damage causing behind closed doors say people suffer anxiety know hell lot people thing disappoints me still stigma attached mental health somehow i want help raise awareness encourage mental health sufferers seek assistance support i want realise alone i also want acknowledge path sound mental health often begins self leadership recognising putting things place work everyday instead hiding away confront head times life things might become bit much line suddenly appears happens next cross deal stay side line slowly
