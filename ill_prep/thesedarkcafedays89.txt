i interesting experience romance years i know may wonder place discussion romantic past mental health blog i think one experience love politics long lasting impact one self esteem perception interaction world like many people i share crushes unlike people however i never actually dated anyone may part social anxiety mostly due circumstances throughout adolescence adult years finding someone attracted able get know well spend time also finds attractive really series lucky coincidences think i surprised happens often anyways i never many friends period much less knew guys reason mostly knew girls know guys either i much opportunity get know guys i get chance i either get shy let opportunity pass often try really hard come shell find guy i like uninterested even shy i leave summary romantic life level vagueness one particular relationship i go however started fall junior year college friend helped run choir i joined year let me know another guy joining reminded me many ways thought i would good fit curiosity piqued course i eager meet made many efforts try get know choir began practice hang seemed slowly open pretty receptive friendship came support me coffeehouse performance i i ecstatic budding relationship hopeful future enamored guy good qualities handsome facade relationship plateaued however i found mutual friend winter break actually interested someone else i still really sure happened best guess may interested me early lost desire get know me better relationship readily available girl developed choir forbade dating among current members luck exactly side either anyways i found i truly devastated i really high hopes whole thing i come really admire guy seemed lot better quality duds i tried connect oh young naive none true hurts rejected favor another girl particularly impressive little i got bad news luck would i begun sink renewed state clinical depression probably i medication six months i unable process bad reaction worst bout depression date occurred next year top things i could shake feelings guy whose feelings engaged elsewhere one situations keep getting little glimpses hope like reminders love fixated want see going get maybe would even good bit love lost causes situation i lot emotional turmoil highs lows related relationship guy made worse poor coping mechanisms general state anguish emotional instability low self esteem overwhelm i could deal emotions i felt intense sadness hopelessness i confronted day distress guy made things even worse sometimes i turned self injury deal intense pain feelings worthlessness tricky deal relationship person often enough says something sweet show care concerned going turns around subtly belittles ignores neglects rest time hard garner strength conviction cut relationship easy blame issues relationship remain blind faults callousness party however i slowly became disillusioned one afternoon choir performance small interaction simple one minute exchange spoke volumes character regard me broke enchantment action deal breaker quite trivial struck me like slap face really care much me feel bad putting me looked me bother friends get know me mind rude take feelings consideration saw me stupid annoying girl would rather talk big boys spend time trying prove maybe i exaggerate bit saddening freeing realize i needed walk away i free cage cage i wanted live outside i sure direction take things never quite i started cut ties heart real life interactions i left school i stopped contacting i even unfriended facebook difficult emotionally keep seeing reminders tempting opportunity track i longer found myself attracted i still felt extraordinarily angry happened eager prove let good one get away desirous one day see pain caused me bitter eyes less worthy girlfriend i still wondered i good enough i still grappled insecurity embedded heart i still simmered canned rage injustice emotions got buried weight time medication occasionally resurface i felt myself change i exited adolescence went drug killed romantic sexual desires thoughts hormones driven me constantly need stimulation romantic interest calm i began adjust new situation life life plan expectations completely demolished one swipe fate years i assumed i would graduate college i loved dearly four years hard work pleasant camaraderie i would get engaged senior year like many girls i saw i would get married summer graduation i would get entry level job semi interested me work couple years hub dub dubs i decided start popping babies i would become stay home mom next twenty years living handsome hopefully well earning husband income boom zapped map even one fragment left i left school nothing really worked way i hoped anyways i dated anyone prospects anyone date much less marry i realizing i even like children much slowly dawned me i going need career i might never get married actually i may even already decided i might even want get married i reflected failed romances disappointment disillusionment yore i realized majority guys i met though considered kind humble attractive saintly guys standards actually kind arrogant closed self absorbed looked surface niceties ways though i continued quest somebody hold i still occasionally dreamt scenarios meeting guy found myself hoping maybe mr right would walk cafe lunch day etc notably i kept contact one guy friend school strictly friendly banter i let mind wander rarely possibilities fun conversations sense humor bit similar one time came show told me one day i realized i thing i hoping someone really care much me romantically would change mind i pinning hope emotional well someone particularly concern mine may like me well enough care well care enough pursue deeper relationship put line never contacted me accord really interested me i would make myself miserable trying wish romantic interest like i guys i gradually came shift thinking romantic relationships i realized previously goal one reality find right one i realized idea linking myself one person rest lives crazy say done say done lightly romantic relationship obsession still present many facets society easy want find someone good enough date someone i decided flip perspective look things way i finally content single i induced getting emotionally involved someone unless person really demonstrated character traits i come find highly desirable even necessary life partner unless person really appreciated respected me person i know natural reaction well enjoy single cuz going find anybody standards i find somebody anybody connect myself someone permanently emotional well compromised lack interest character compassion i significant majority guys i liked i look back feel relieved nothing happened light bad traits i finally stopped ignoring i able stop liking would i carry around burden feeling like i deserve romantic relationships i undesirable i going live life fullest explore possibilities me i one day came across someone recognized i person worth i would open exploring avenue i longer going torture myself harboring feelings people invested me pinning hopes happiness unlikely chance one day would change mind
