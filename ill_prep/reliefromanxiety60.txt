passing driving test december next goal drive alone me throughout journey i started driving i unfortunately i stop driving i felt well enough day however i got first car little i know expensive would turn i would pay freedom day first drive alone scary i felt adrenaline rush body heart come chest even drive road continued go many weeks appeared body used driving calmed right i think worry unknown i completely rely myself anxiety provoking part weeks passed i got confident i travelled last month sometime throughout summer i took upon myself three hour motorway drive somewhere i never driven i feel calm collected i ability turned bad i envisaged everything seems anxiety always worse seems stronger believe well capable think might shock challenges undertake i know i still learning drive struggling drive get may rollercoaster took many years get i today i still made best wishes amy xx
