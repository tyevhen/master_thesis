although i travelled far road recovery i still bad days i suppose much i dread hate days reminder i robot various reasons i like remain sound steady days ca anxiety hits wounds opened everyone see much problem others like digging grave ways depend person environment i could i would avoid days pain ensues raw emotion others see i know feelings even harshest strongest people emotions come time emotions come whether like something help happens people better hiding prefer show day something triggered anxiety good reason course works way i like see someone poking bees nest end however robots even appear try emotion always best wishes amy xx
