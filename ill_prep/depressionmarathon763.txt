i finished saturday long run today i class weekend pretty even though day beautiful actually i hard myself shocking actually decent run i take couple breaks along way i developed side ache around mile i finished i averaged bit minutes per mile i planned last miles colored perception entire run i guess good run like i said gorgeous day today i love fall favorite season far air warm dry breeze cool changing leaves beautiful smell fall best i love sound leaves tumbling wind i spent large part run trampling leaves parks along shady lanes scenery certainly added bit serenity effort today i resting watching baseball boo hoo twins lost last night enjoying fresh air streaming windows i think i energy accomplish much else today i hoping dinner friends twins win tonight life back little bit normal stress last week past i grateful opportunity missed people dressed overalls looks like work thomas edison people dream success others wake work hard author unknown
