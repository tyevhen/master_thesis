i feeling much inspiration lately terms blog writing i hoping sort soon meantime i wanted share something written someone else guys i know large percentage readers blog interested unschooling back sister emi written debate friends let me read i asked since blog i could share written blog said yes i thankful got lost forgotten entirely kindly dug me i asked keep mind written something ridiculous like night i fixed typos unavoidable time night morning well editing names involved debate first name removed i understand say 'do see far life could get unschooling i know people gotten entire lives least lives far age thirty something case oldest unschooler i know done fine well fine really well actually yes get life wonderfully unschooled proven many people people high school get choose paths extent high school must take certain classes follow certain rules much less freedom unschooled person choose path leave high school point jump me i saying people developed narrow view options unschoolers whole case every individual lived free lives often see many possibilities live lives often mainstream way people point saying choose path classes well proving point really get choose path never interested math never done well math class last year high school developed burning passion science decided wanted scientist since never done well math required probably go cegep course never realize dream scientist whereas unschooling person spent entire lives knowing could learn want want whatever way want would find ways learn math go university taking science courses become scientist like wanted unschoolers never education restricted false notions one learn certain things certain points certain doors become closed certain points arbitrary rules coming public school i wonderfully happy unschooled i want try public school reason i suggested guys try unschooling i gotten impression happy school i know sure two directly said dislike school me name removed 'well works would everyone argument one i hear quite often reasonable concern i disagree true high school indeed lot people would know without teachers telling spent entire life instructed spend time learn etc children born instinct learn babies touch things put mouths mimic adults learn naturally toddlers still curiosity world urge explore figure things ask questions school puts child classroom learn naturally interacting world forces children sit still keep hands squashing natural urges learn allowed follow particular interests passions allowed learn love instead forced learn prescribed set things whether find things interesting forced learn fear disappointing parents told failed looked stupid peers forced memorize facts want kept learning world natural way instinctive desire learn dampened sometimes destroyed entirely time child reaches high school chances good know without instruction probably desire learn learning synonymous work way might right maybe would motivation anything maybe lot teens would i know i one sometimes much motivation either natural tendencies towards laziness procrastination i learned ways dealing motivating myself also might good mention lot people even high school would motivated learn things interested i bet great majority people would motivated slightest learn lot stuff taught school okay people need know everything taught school get life argue people need taught school get life i know many many people unschooled learned little schools teach adults functioning well earning money 'real world second point assuming everyone wants go cegep trade school get job age people give cegep miss go university people give cegep university miss never go sort school people already know trade need go trade school people want go traditional path university trade school want spend time getting used freedom leaving school gives learning love follow path point regardless age long takes adjust school never late leave argument point parents point i agree sadly huge reason stop people unschooling i hope parents open minded put trust children children capabilities name removed first point world anarchy would better opinion whole 'nother debate p correct me i wrong basically agreeing school controlling directs people onto certain mainstream pre determined paths good thing otherwise people would work mindlessly current societal system i honestly trying snide really seems like saying i could disagree system controls people molds certain lifestyles government deems worthy completely immoral opinion peoples general stupidity i believe good part gone school system discourages thinking outside box teaches obedience authority without question i touched replying name removed people allowed learn naturally world around would whole develop open minded thoughtful people better capable handling new situations new problems new ideas i know people unschooled certainly things moving along i find term 'real schooling kind insulting nothing less 'real valid unschooling also phrasing opinion nothing imposed masses let leave another debate say school imposed people ignorant poor true i know many times i said i know lots intelligent well rounded socially adept money making unschoolers seems i need say least clearly thousands unschooled people prove unschooling breed ignorance poverty think people unschooled would change unschoolers elite group people genetically pre determined motivated intelligent lifestyle leads qualities taken seriously work force true i feel need delve different reasons first one puts 'unschooled resume person goes cegep university would put qualifications resume potential employer would care done high school years ditto went trade school acquired papers touting qualifications secondly assuming unschoolers want get traditional jobs join regular workforce incorrect assumption i draw examples unschoolers i know self employed people started businesses become midwives massage therapists travel tour guides one number nontraditional jobs unschooler wants make money self employed unschooler wants get traditional job go university trade school courses get need get hired job key thing unschoolers know learn accomplish things without instructed forced capable taking whatever path choose well path whole first paragraph seem saying everyone unschooled would unbalance current society likely true i think society breeds ignorance bigotry violence poverty would better changes free thinking open minded curious competent unschoolers could bring second paragraph whoof getting tired typing fingers p hope guys still reading understanding i falling asleep keyboard child pressured tools marking system learning things want learn one ever needs forced learn person learn need live world without forced i stress point enough address last point i start saying extremely disrespectful comments especially last one seems me saying unschoolers ca socially interact well people public school kills me little inside see people still using ancient 'but go school must isolated un socialized argument simply true think i socially inept i certainly know unschooled friends age unschooled friends adults living 'real world speak much fine socially interact many people daily basis friends social circle indeed work side side co workers every day perfectly capable perfectly possible fact easy socially network without school let me use obvious examples extra curricular activities sports cadets guides clubs etc etc etc also community getting know neighbors case teens kids people neighborhood age i think great people actually developed strong sense community knew people living closest also unschooling community conferences local support activity groups etc know social life fun summer everyone school i actually get see talk interact schooled friends lot instead trapped schools encouraged sit quietly learn day rather socially interact imply i might add well i think everything sorry bits make sense typos nigh morning i want proof read heckuva long message sis wonderful writer writes fiction mostly also wonderfully i always love seeing forays non fiction always good i envious debating skills even better morning p peace idzie
