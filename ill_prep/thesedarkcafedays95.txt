self consciousness pretty much girls i encountered college absolutely brutally hard appearance made me upset see hear long made me angry society across nations across time puts value one two sorts body types physical features beautiful attractive making everyone quite often even possess features sick insecurity envy discontent look way make sense everybody every body wildly different every person unique incredible much variety comes appearance two people exact physical features paper reality quite distinct person variety seems silly choose traits desirable declare people beautiful decides traits anyways expend much time effort money trying look certain way probably wo even happy even looked way heart breaking would probably function much better society individuals content looked praised people looks beyond attraction really odd unpredictable thing many things make person beautiful i focus romantic side attractive since much claim drives desire look certain way personally i think people individuality makes attractive rather conformity certain standard types physical traits i found attractive changed time often govern i ended finding myself attracted end fun find someone perfectly fits description perfect man woman equally intriguing fall person nothing like ever thought attracted people i used find extremely physically attractive i look really see much anything even still look i guess i saying attraction necessarily dictated societal standards people tend stand someone finds attractive unique way comes person really loves love makes silly encourage
